The lobster mac and cheese had close to NO lobster, completely different from the picture on the menu. It had no seasoning either. I think it was cooked and then reheated. too much garlic as well.\nOne of the restaurant managers, a man, was making excuses when we asked him, \"Why did the starter come after the main course?\" He said, \"This is just the way we do things. We don't really look at which is the starter or the main. We just go down the list and send out food in that order.\" No professionalism at all.\nThe waiters were walking zombies who also did not have any product knowledge when it came to food. They were not attentive. Only one waiter stood out to us as attentive and polite. He was an elderly gentleman who was not very tall. He carried himself as professionally as possible and always checked on our tables to see if we needed anything. He was more professional and polite than the male manager.\nBreakfast was terrible as well. Food was trash. The nasi lemak was an insult to Singapore cuisine. The chef was obviously unpassionate about his job. He should find another job.",

      "negative": "A hotel that is famous for its garden view and  I can clearly see that there are not much guests staying. Why did the staff not putting effort to let new guest to enjoy the beautiful greenery view? Instead we were facing the road view.\nAlso the air ventilation gave out loud vibration noises every 30-40min interval.. Its loud enough to wake up most of us during the night \nThe management need to conduct regular checks on their hotel appliances, the room I stayed got few minor defects ie phone, shower head holder, nespresso machine, very slow wifi,..

      "negative": "First off, we thought that the staff handling the check in process in the lobby behaved very unprofessionally. He referred to us as “boy” and “girl” - such as saying, “girl, sit here to wait”.\nSecond, we informed them when making the booking months in advance that we were staying there as a mini “honeymoon” as we had just gotten married that weekend before. We also requested a quiet room as we usually do. They informed us that they would “do something creative in the room” for us since we were on our honeymoon, and said that they would do their best to assign a quiet room on a higher floor for us. During check in, we again reiterated our request for a quiet room, but the lady handling our check in curtly replied that they had limited King rooms in the hotel. No apology, no explanation, did not seem to make any effort to allocate us a quiet room.\nNot only did we not get a quiet room, we were in fact assigned an adjoining room next to a family, which was at the entrance of the corridor. The noises of housekeeping outside were audible, and we could even hear snippets of conversations and the alarm clock going off each morning from the family next door, through the adjoining door. One of the noisiest rooms we have ever stayed at. Despite saying that they would decorate the room, nothing was done during the two nights we stayed there.\nThird, the hotel itself seemed far more tired and run down than when we had stayed there a few years ago. Many areas could be better kept and could use a fresh coat of paint.\nFourth, service was lacking in so many areas, from the people we interacted with during check in and those who were at the club reception for the gym and the pool. The hotel did not give any instructions for how to use the gym and pool. We had to find out on our own that you had to check in at the basement counter before using the pool and the gym, and that the pool could only be accessed from the third floor.",

When we asked for a late checkout, this was denied. I felt that it would be a nice gesture to reciprocate the unavailability of the room. \n4) during check out, no one even asked how was our stay.

The staff said that it was not possible, but near the end of our 7 pm slot, the pool was totally empty. It would have cost them nothing to give us an additional slot, since it seemed that there was no one else booked in anyways.\nAt the pool, service was slow and there was no way to easily order food or drinks. The waiter seemed confused and had to go and retrieve the menu from a QR code inside the building, which took another 30 minutes. This could be easily remedied by having ready QR codes by the pool and coming up with some sort of pool side ordering experience.\nWe were also looking forward to breakfast at the hotel, but upon check in were told that the only available slot was at 7 am, which felt way too early. No apologies or attempts to help us come up with alternate solutions. We ended up checking out early to eat out at a nearby restaurant.\nGiven Covid and the havoc it has wreaked on the hospitality industry, I understand that many hotels are understaffed. However, the few staff that we did encounter did not seem to want to help or provide solutions to the hiccups we encountered. Very disappointing.",

At 3pm the room was not ready and we were told to wait.

To the other extreme, we only managed to collect our keys 10 minutes  past 3pm which is later than the official checked in time and this is only after a few attempts checking with the staff. It was only the latest check with the manager that the room was ready and placed at the side of the reception staff as she was talking to new guests. Just wondering if we will continue to sit down there and wait unnecessarily if we don't check with them again. That sums up a bad start to the day. The situation was worse when I need to go around the whole hotel to just to search for swimming towels. It was shocking that the towels were placed no where near the pool. I walked back to the level two door that I came out from to search for towels after seeing no towels around the pool. I was told by a guest that the towel was taken from basement one. I walked down from level 2 after passing the stretch of hotel with dripping water one level down, out of the glass door near the reception and took that glass lift to basement one, past the b1 carpark before reaching the towel collection point. After taking the towel, I was told that the nearest lift up was not working. I walked past a Caucasian guest asking me where do I get the towel? Can you believe it? Everyone walking around the hotel looking for swimming pool towels that were 3 floors down. (It will be consider fortunate for guests who made their way from the lap pool side and more unfortunate for someone like me who went from the other side , walked one whole round before getting to the correct place. I have to climb 3 storeys up before reaching the lap pool and up the small stairs before eventually reaching the pool where my family was. My wife thought why I went away for so long while she struggled with 2 toddlers in the pool. It's really confusing where there well no bathroom towels nearer to the pool unlike any other hotels.",

The general upkeep of the property didn’t seem great, noticed a lot of patches where paint was peeling and falling off (not a great look when you are marketing a property as 5* property).",

When I called again upon her arrival call front desk a male staff answer and said they do not provide such services. I explained your staff told me they do he was firm that they cannot do it and ask me to come down. Then next day I asked can I check out 15 mins later the time. The male staff was rude and said no check out now. Staff experience was really bad for such a good hotel.",

The gym and pool are great. The hotel is in a nice and quiet location and is only 30 min walk from the marina, however it's on top of a hill so walking back up from the marina can be a little tiring if you're not used to walking uphill for 30 minutes.",
      "negative": "The room had a smart TV big enough for how far the bed is from it. However, they have disabled every smart feature in the TV. You're only limited to a few tv channels that show old movies and shows. Seriously, who watches TV anymore! I had my own FireStick to connect to the TV. But they have also disabled any means of switching the input on the TV so you can't even switch to HDMI. The remotes are aftermarket remotes with only the necessary buttons. And they've disabled the physical buttons on the TV to go through menus. It's not like this was an oversight from their part. They're doing this intentionally! I absolutely hated the hours i spent late at night watching netflix on my phone when i had this large TV that i could be watching on. Major disappointment!!!",
