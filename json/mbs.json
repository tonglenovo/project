Then to our amazement we received another call offering us a bar tab in the cocktail bar for $50 This was greatly appreciated.

When we asked to pay our bill for the additional drinks we had ordered and expected to pay for we was informed that the whole bill would be settled for us.

Tästä sekoilusta jäi huono maku ja erityisesti pitkä seisominen tiskillä väsyneenä 11 tunnin lennon jälkeen.\nBooking comin sivuilla kerrotaan aina mitkä luottokortit käyvät kussakin hotellissa ja näin mekin uskoimme. Pitäisi olla erityismaininta että Marina Bay Sandsin takuusumma ainakin virkailijan mukaan menee aina asiakkaan Debit kortin puolelta ei Luottopuolelta.  Eli asiakkaana et voi valita kummalta puolelta hotellin takuumaksun maksat. Aika tärkeä asia koska takuumaksut voivat olla satoja euroja ja maksaisit sen mieluimmin luottopuolelta, koska joissakin maissa voit joutua odottamaan rahaa hotellilta takaisin parikin viikkoa, puhun kokemuksesta.\nAamiainen mielestäni ylihinnoiteltu viideltä hengeltä maksoi n. 160 euroa.",

Die Jungs von der Gepäckaufbewahrung waren die freundlichsten Mitarbeiter im kompletten Hotel und besonders Tanesh hat uns mit seiner freundlichen und gut gelaunten Art doch noch einen schönen Abschluss vom Urlaub beschert.",
      "negative": "Diese Massenabfertigung. Klar gehen viele wie wir nur für eine Nacht hin, um einmal diesen Pool mit dieser Aussicht gesehene zu haben. Für den Preis erwarte ich mehr. Wir kamen um 13 Uhr zum Check-in und sollten per Mail informiert werden, wenn das Zimmer früher fertig sein sollte. Meine Mailadresse ist dann falsch eingegeben worden obwohl ich es buchstabiert hatte, so dass wir 2 Stunden oben am Pool warteten und anstatt dass dort oben einfach so ein Schalter ist wo man ab 15 Uhr seine Zimmerkarte hinheben kann, um zu wissen welches Zimmer man hat, mussten wir wieder zum Check-in uns anstellen und erfragen wo wir hinmüssen. Im Zimmer gab es eine Kontaktproblem, so dass der Strom ständig ausfiel. Wir warteten dann über eine halbe Stunde bis jemand kam, um es sich anzuschauen und danach ist der Strom wieder ausgefallen. Alles Zeit, die wir gerne oben am Pool verbracht hätten. Am Pool ist halt mega viel los, aber das war abzusehen. Die Leute sind eigentlich auch nur für‘s Bilder machen im Wasser, damit man das perfekte Instagramfoto hat, aber wir haben uns ja auch aufgrund dieser Aussicht für eine Nacht für dieses Hotel entschieden. Wir hatten zwei Cocktails bestellt, einer war leer und in einem noch etwa 1/3 drin und wie wir wieder vom Pool zurückkommen an unsere Liegen, waren beide Cocktails abgeräumt und auf Nachfrage beim Kellner sind wir erstmal doof angemacht worden, dass da ja sowieso nicht mehr viel drin gewesen war. Ich konnte immerhin einen neuen Cocktail raushandeln. Beim Check-out bin ich gefragt worden ob ich zufrieden war mit meinem Aufenthalt und als ich es verneinte, ging man überhaupt nicht drauf ein. Es interessiert keinen, da es das Hotel nicht nötig hat, da ja viele nur für eine Nacht kommen und danach nie wieder, so wie wir. \nEs gibt in Singapur durchaus auch andere tolle Hotels mit einem schönen Ausblick und Dachterassenpool für weniger Geld bzw. wesentlich besserem Service. Dieses Hotel ist der Preis nicht wert.",

La famosa piscina del piso 57 está llena de gente de todo tipo y el personal es bastante maleducado en el trato. En resumen, lo bueno que tiene la infraestructura se pierde con el tipo de gente que se aloja, la mala calidad de la comida y bebida y el trato de algunos miembros del personal. Ah, me olvidaba. A nosotros no nos pasó, pero si no pagan una habitación de las más caras, pueden hacer un hora de cola en el check in y check out. Para finalizar, el día que llegamos, nos dijeron que nos lleváramos nosotros las valijas porque “tardarían 40 minutos en llevarlas a la habitación” por la gente que se estaba alojando. En resumen, vayan a otro lado si les gusta un lugar exclusivo y bien atendido.",

Die Öffnungszeiten der Restaurants und besonders der Bars sind ein Witz. Um 21:30 schliessen die meisten Restaurants und um 22:30 sind auch die Bars zu. Für ein Hotel mit diesem Anspruch ist das ein Trauerspiel. Was nützen dann hunderte, menschenleere Läden sämtlicher Luxusmarken dieser Welt in denen sich die Angestellten von morgens bis abends langweilen. Der Zugang zum Infinitipool wird sehr kompliziert reglementiert und für das Gros der Gäste absichtlich erschwert. Zum Sonnenuntergang ein Zugangsfenster zu bekommen war unmöglich.

      "negative": "Para ser uno de los hoteles más impresionantes del mundo, la habitación, que está muy bien, no es tan especial como esperábamos. Hemos estado en muchos 5* o incluso 4* con habitaciones mejores. La piscina, como era de esperar, está bastante llena, lo que le quita un poco el glamour... La relación calidad/precio no es muy buena. El check-out tardó demasiado (tuvieron algún problema con la impresora - no obstante, nos imprimieron las tarjetas de embarque).",

Во-вторых, большие комфортабельные номера, присутствуют тапочки, халат, принадлежности в ванной все и даже больше, чайник, холодильник, можно разместиться с большим комфортом.

Das vergleichsweise billige Triple Two Hotel auf der Silom Road in Bangkok ist zwar kleiner, aber viel feiner.\nDiesen Nachteil macht auch der spektakuläre Infinity-Pool nicht wett!

Polecam głównie pokoje znajdujące się powyżej 40 piętra z widokiem na part - można z balkonu oglądać wieczorne pokazy świateł i przepiękna panorama na redę. Panorama  wieczorna na stronne miasta jest urokliwa z tarasu na dachu tzw. \"deski do prasowania\" jak go zwą miejscowi. Przy basenie na dachu jest bardzo dobra restauracja i bufet. Na sam basen najlepiej iść rano ok. dziewiątej bo potem jest dużo turystów. Ręczniki dostaje się przy wejściu na basen. Proszę też pamiętać, że w hotelu poruszamy się z kartą otrzymaną w recepcji. Służy nie tylko do otwierania drzwi ale też do wejścia do wielu miejsc, chociażby na basen. W dzień w hotelu można śmiało poruszać się w szlafroku kąpielowym ( na wyposażeniu pokoju). ja osobiście tego nie akceptuję ale goście hotelowi głównie Chińczycy i Hindusi poruszają się z pokoju na basen i po górnym tarasie w szlafrokach.",

Um nicht mehr warten zu müssen haben wir ein Zimmer mit zwei Kingsizebetten angeboten bekommen, für welches wir uns entschieden haben. Da das Zimmer günstiger war als das ursprünglich gebuchte wir jedoch schon bezahlt haben, wurde und ein Voucher in Höhe von 200S$ versprochen. Im Zimmer war alles für 2 Personen ausgelegt wie z.B. Zahnbürsten und Handtücher, das war etwas unglücklich. Nach dem Frühstück wurde von uns die Summe von etwas mehr als 200S$ gefordert, als ich erklärte, dass für uns ein Voucher von 200S$ im System hinterlegt worden war, konnte die Servicekraft nicht viel damit anfangen und somit unterschrieb ich die Rechnung. Beim Auschecken wurden dann die etwas mehr als 200S$ eingefordert. Wieder musste ich erklären, dass wir am Vortag einen Voucher in Höhe von 200S$ bekommen haben. Bei so einer teuren Übernachtung hätte ich persönlich etwas mehr \"Professionalität\" erwartet.",

До заезда, за несколько дней, отель прислал письмо с просьбой для быстрой регистрации прислать данные о паспортах и времени приезда. Всё передал и напомнил о просьбе во время заказа (номера на верхних этажах и на против друг друга), обещали учесть. При выходе из такси забрали весь багаж (8 чемоданов). Идём для оформления (очередь 2-3 человека), подходит сотрудница и проводит нас для оформления в зал Vip, приятно. Номера очень комфортные. Отель выполнил все просьбы: заселил сразу, 48 этаж, номера напротив друг друга. Большое спасибо.",

Das Gepäck sieht man erst im Zimmer wieder. Man fühlt sich wie ein König. Das Frühstück im Club 55 ist zu empfehlen. Ruhig und sehr gut. Es gibt sogar einen Pancakeautomaten. Sollte man einmal ausprobieren. Um 17 Uhr kann man dort Champagner und andere edle Tropfen sowie viele,viele kleine Köstlichkeiten genießen. Ist im Zimmerpreis enthalten . Hat man ein Zimmer mit Stadtblick kann Mann direkt aus dem Zimmer die Allabendliche Lasershow vom Zimmer aus sehen. Einen besseren Blick darauf gibt es nicht. Abends kann man dann die Brücke im 6. Stock zu den Gärten benutzen. Von dort hat man dann um20 Uhr einen super Blick aus die Lightshow. Alles in allem ist es das Geld wert. Ein gelungener 70. Geburtstag inclusive einer kleinen Geburtstagstorte vom Hotel im Zimmer und Ständchen der Angestellten des Club 55 mit Torte inclusive Kerze.",

Я не смог себя заставить туда залезть даже рано утром, когда почти не было народа. \nВторое, что не понравилось, это постоянная очередь к лифту к Садам у Залива.\nИ рестораны на крыше.

Когда мы подъехали к отелю таксист отказался брать у нас доллары и потребовал рассчитаться с ним только местной валютой. в 5:00 утра было довольно проблематично найти обменный пункт, но на моё удивление к нам подошел обычный грузчик из отеля и предложил за нас рассчитаться (деньги я конечно ему потом отдал и даже с чаевыми). Для меня это было очень большим удивлением. \nДалее на ресепшене нас заселили очень быстро при этом изначально шёл разговор о том что нас поселили в 12 или в 14 часов, но нас совершенно спокойно поселили в отель в 6:00 утра. Мы безумно благодарны им за такой подход. Нас очень быстро оформили и через 15 минут мы уже поднимались в свой номер. Наш номер находился на сорок втором этаже. Номер очень большой с огромными окнами от пола до потолка из очень шикарным видом. Настоятельно всем рекомендую брать номера повыше - вид просто потрясающий, можно просто пол ночи сидеть и смотреть в окно...\nМы прожили в отеле трое суток. Всё очень понравилось очень удобно очень красиво и конечно же восхитительный бассейн на крыше этого отеля. Про него нужно рассказывать отдельно и очень долго, но лучше просто приехать и посмотреть. я настоятельно всем рекомендую посетить этот отель и полюбоваться видами с крыши этого отеля.\nКурение только на улице, за углом отеля. В принципе не напрягало. Огромное количество такси. Конский ценник за обед в кафе на первом этаже - около 70 долл на одного человека. В подвале казино. Дресскод минимальный - я был в шортах и кроссовках - пропустили. Но нужен обязательно паспорт. Огромный зал и миллион китайцев и арабов.  \nПорадовал выезд. Мы рассчитались с вечера за допы (еда, напитки) а утром просто опустили электронный ключ в специальный бокс на 1м этаже и уехали. \nЗамечательный отель.",

На третий день у меня откровенно сильно заболела шея и мне пришлось спать просто на своей куртке. Вполне возможно они могли бы и заменить подушку, но все три дня мы были на ногах и к вечеру приползали очень уставшие.",

Chiedo quindi di fare semplicemente un cambio prenotazione ed evitare di farmi pagare tutti quei soldi in più, visto che stavo già pagando una doppia 470€ per una notte e ora invece una tripla costava 380. Mi son dovuto recare direttamente in struttura per risolvere la situazione, alla fine al prezzo di 470€, ovvero il mio prezzo pagato per una doppia hanno fatto entrare anche la terza persona (la camera doppia ha due letti a una piazza e mezza, in tre ci siamo stati tranquillamente) ma ci hanno dato solo due tessere illimitate a tutti i servizi dell'hotel, tra cui la.famosa piscina, la terza tessera poteva accedere solamente alla piscina per 4 ore. Un hotel a cinque stelle dovrebbe venire incontro al cliente, la prenotazione l'avrei dovuta pagare in struttura all'arrivo, quindi potevano semplicemente annullare la prima sbagliata e farmi prenotare nuovamente la camera tripla che tra l'altro costava anche meno rispetto a quello che ho pagato.",

Людей около бассейна действительно много, но места можно найти всегда.  Просторные, светлые и уютные номера, окна в пол, высокого качества полотенца и постельное белье. Иногда в номере убирались 2 раза в день и полностью пополняли запасы моющих средств в ванной и чай, вода, кофе.  Понравился торговый центр, переход из отеля не выходя на улицу. Вообщем,  вернусь в Сингапур и этот отель с большим удовольствием!!!",

Это действительно очень интересно. Бронировали на одну ночь самый недорогой номер, для того чтобы посмотреть Сингапур с высоты птичьего полёта, поплескаться в бассейне на крыше и позагорать. Предложили за те же деньги великолепно оборудованный люкс на 48-м этаже площадью 136 кв. м. с тремя балконами,  с бильярдной и мультимедийным залом, и продлили пребывание в клубном лаундже и бассейне на три часа до 14-00.

Natürlich hat es seinen Preis, aber es ist jeden Cent wert. Es ist definitiv eines der außergewöhnlichsten Hotels dieser Welt, und man genießt dabei eine sehr entspannte Atmosphäre (nicht so steif oder manchmal auch etwas hochnäsig wie in anderen hochklassigen Hotels). Das Personal ist durch die Bank die Freundlichkeit in Person, und sowohl innen wie außen kommt man aus dem Staunen nicht mehr heraus. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit \"Garden View\" im 17. Stock und waren darüber sehr glücklich (obwohl offensichtlich viele den \"City View\" bevorzugen), denn von dort konnten wir wenige Stunden nach unserer Ankunft bereits das abendliche Lichtschauspiel von \"Gardens by the Bay\" mit bester Aussicht bewundern. DIE Highlights überhaupt sind natürlich der Infinity Pool und der Skypark, egal ob in der Morgen-, Nachmittags- oder Abendsonne, das Wasser war überhaupt nicht so kalt wie teilweise behauptet, auch die Jacuzzis sind sehr zu empfehlen (heisser als bei uns gewohnt, aber sehr entspannend). Wir waren essen im Mott32 in der Shopping Mall (chinesisch mit sehr aufmerksamem Service) und im Lavo (italienisch im Skypark - gutes Essen und noch spektakulärere Aussicht bei Nacht an der Bar auf Singapur, natürlich bei einem Singapore Sling).

      "positive": "So zahlreich und schön die sonstigen Einrichtungen und Möglichkeiten im Hotel sind, letztlich steigt man im MBS ab, um den Infinity-Pool zu erleben und zu genießen (alles andere glaube ich nicht). Das Erlebnis Infinity-Pool selbst ist dann ein absolutes Highlight. Wenn man von den ganzen Instagram-Posern absieht, ist es wirklich ein tolles Gefühl, sowohl die Blicke von den Liegen als auch aus dem Pool selber. Der Pool ist 1,20 Meter tief, also kein wirklicher Pool zum Schwimmen. Es ist das Gefühl hoch über der Stadt im Wasser / der Sonne zu relaxen, was es ausmacht. Liegen sind ausreichend vorhanden, zumal sich die meisten Gäste nur zeitlich begrenzt am Pool aufhalten. Die Preise für Snacks und Getränke sind (für Singapur Verhältnisse) überraschend human. Aber auch ansonsten bietet das Hotel natürlich einiges, speziell die im Dachbereich befindlichen Restaurants (wie z. B. das Lavo) und Bars sind zu empfehlen, da man auch hier (speziell am Abend / Nacht) tollen Block auf die (erleuchtete) Stadt hat. Speisen und Getränke sind gut aber auch nichts, was es nicht auch in Deutschland (in Ketten-Restaurants) gibt. Auch in der näheren Umgebung gibt es eine Menge interessanter Einrichtungen wie die Gardens of the the Bay, das Art Science Museum, die Esplanade (mit Theater & Konzertsaal) aber auch der Clarke Quay (Flaniermeile) sind nicht wirklich weit weg. Das Hotel ist auch Richtung der anderen Stadtteile (little India, Chinatown, Arab Street, Orchard Road etc.) durch zwei MRT Stations (Bayfront & Marina Bay MRT Station) sehr gut erschlossen. Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 49 Stock mit Zugang zum Club 55. Das hiermit verbundene Frühstück und der Nachmittagstee waren wirklich exquisit, große Auswahl, viel Frische, hohe Qualität, toller Ausblick.",
      "negative": "Die Lobby am Tower 1 ist noch ziemlich beeindruckend, aber der Lobby-Bereich dahinter bzw. bis zum Tower 3 wirkt mehr wie ein heller U-Bahntunnel mit Läden. Natürlich ist dies immer ein subjektiver Eindruck, aber ich fand diesen Bereich eines Hotel, welches bei Buchung zuhause gewisse Erwartungen weckt, ziemlich unpersönlich und nichts sagend. Groß bzw. riesig ja, aber nichts was wirklich in Erinnerung bleibt.   \nDie angrenzende Mall besteht nahezu ausschließlich aus Läden, in denen es für den normalen Gast nicht einmal für ein paar Socken reicht. Gucci, Dior, Bvlgari, D&G etc. soweit das Auge reicht, \"normale\" Läden sind an wenigen Fingern abzuzählen",

Es lohnt sich, ein Zimmer in einer der oberen Etagen zu buchen, da diese für gewöhnlich größer sind und sich der bessere Ausblick wirklich lohnt. Zimmer- und Badausstattung sind gehoben; wir hatten zwei XXL-Fernseher mit AirPlay-Funktion auf dem Zimmer. Uns wurde kostenfrei sowohl ein Early Check-In als auch ein Late Check-Out gewährt.\nHighlight ist natürlich der Pool mit atemberaubendem Panoramablick. Zum Zeitpunkt unseres Aufenthalts musste der Zugang zum Pool aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie vorab reserviert werden und war auf 1:15h pro Tag begrenzt, was auch strikt kontrolliert wurde. Dies hat jedoch den Vorteil, dass deutlich weniger Andrang als gewöhnlich herrschte und man große Teile des Pools für sich allein hatte. Ich kann besonders die Slots zum Sonnenuntergang (tolle Fotos) und den letzten Slot am Vormittag (Keine Zeitbegrenzung zum Mittag hin) besonders empfehlen.\nEin Muss ist auch der \"Late Lunch\" im italienischen Restaurant LAVO auf der obersten Etage, der auch Nicht-Hotelgästen offen steht: Tolles Ambiente, fantastischer Service und für die Lage gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Das Angebot an Essens-, Entertainment- und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten im Marina Bay Sands sind nahezu unbegrenzt; man hält es hier locker sogar mehrere Tage aus. Luggage-Storage auch vor Check-In oder nach Check-Out steht kostenfrei zur Verfügung. Rundum ein fantastisches Erlebnis!",

Es gleicht eher einem Informationsschalter.\n- Die Verbindung zum Gardens by the Bay ist nicht ausgeschildert und wir mussten etwas suchen\n- Der Infinity Pool war leider nicht beheizt und für August sehr kalt. \n- Frühstück kostet nochmal 50 Dollar extra (pro Person) und ist leider nicht empfehlenswert.\n- Bei der Buchung hieß es 200 Dollar Kaution, vor Ort mussten wir für 2 Zimmer 800 Dollar Kaution hinterlassen.

We even got great advice from the bell boy who recommended Chinatown for dinner and a singapore signature dish of tien tien at maxwell food centre which was worth the trip to Chinatown. Our room was budget, 6th floor but extremely roomy. The location perfect.

And when we arrived at the hotel, we were met by one of the staff who took us to the checkout-in lounge instead of the regular check-in desk. There she arranged for immediate access to our rooms, although it was only 9 am while check-in is at 3 pm. That was highly welcome after a long flight. \nOur luggage was lost and we had to re-arrange our travel plans for the next day, and not only did the hotel arrange for a change in our airport transfer, but we also got late check-out and could keep the room until our departure! This was an unexpected perk, which gave us the possibility to sleep in and rest before our onward travel.\nBoth macrons and a birthday cake was delivered to our room during the day, with compliments of the hotel as the staff had noticed when registering our passports that it was my husbands birthday four days later.\nWe had two connecting rooms, which was really nice when traveling with teenagers. The rooms were spacious and with large balconies with view on Gardens by the Bays. \nAnd needless to say - the rooftop pool and the view from the pool is exceptional.

Then, she also told me that all my dining at the restaurants, would not be eligible as well as the whole bill was consolidated thru my Booking.com booking.  After explaining that I had even checked at the respective restaurants showing my rewards card, each time when closing my bill and was told it would still be okay if I just put it on my room.  She then checked with the restaurant to learn that, indeed that is the way the restaurants have been informing their guests. She then said she will put in a request into their finance team to see if only the food bills could be redeemed for Rewards points.  With that, I lost interest, as it seemed I was just a small customer, as I had only spent about $3000 for a two nights stay.",

Late checkout, hotel services access on the day you check out or even simply having a car ready for you to take you at the airport at a certain. They are too busy for that and have a lot of other customers to attend to. It seems that as time goes by, hotels just remove more and more of those perks we travelers really enjoy, particularly at this level of pricing. A shame...",

We sat down at a random table and again, we were ignored for almost 10 minutes. None of the staff tried to approach us and offered us any help. We finally managed to catch a staff and asked to take orders. He then said that the table was only for Restaurant users and asked us to move out. In a polite way, but we were not welcomed for sure. They did not even try to help us find a place to sit. We were embarrassed and totally disappointed on this service from the restaurant and decided to move out.

I had to spend 15 minutes to argue with the check-out staff to dispute such unreasonable charge as I did not consume anything in the mini bar and I had to move the items because the mini bar was also a fridge and I had to store something in the fridge by taking out some items from the fridge and then putting them back later.

The room was very big (we got given a family room with a double bed in a master room and an extra pull out sofa bed in a separate area). The master bedroom was an ensuite, with the bathroom also being very large, it included; a shower, bathtub, toilet and 2 sinks. There was an extra room near the entrance with just a toilet and sink which was also nice. We had two TV’s and a large desk with chair. As well as an extra table in the first room (this could be used to even have a coffee or tea in the morning). Alternatively, there was a table on the very large balcony that followed through from the first room area across to the master bedroom. The room was clean and all amenities were provided (bath salts was a nice extra touch). \nThe pool was stunning, unfortunately we could not appreciate the view as much as desired due to the high PSI level. However, this was not MBS’ fault. Additionally, even though we did not use the gym, we went to view it and despite not being immensely large, there’s a lot of equipment available for use. We also did not get to use the SPA but it looked lovely too.\nThe staff was very friendly and the restaurants inside, although on the pricey side as imaginable, had a few options. With the choice of walking just a few minutes to the Marina Bay Sands mall. We had dinner at a buffet restaurant located in the hotel. I would say it was a good choice, with kind staff that recommended signing up for the free Marina Bay Sands Rewards card to enjoy a discount starting from that meal. \nOverall, I would say our stay was great and we only wish we had more time there.",

However, if there was anything to comment on, I would just say it would be nice to still be able to access the pool and other such facilities after check out, till the end of that day. As of now, from check out time you can not access the facilities anymore.\nThe only other thing I would say is that we did not get to spend enough time there.",

The room certainly could not do this, there were only 2 oversized single beds in the room which could only accommodate 2 adults.\nAdditionally, the booking stated (on Booking.com), that the Marina Bay Sands accepted all cards, which were duly listed. When I was sent the online payment it only allowed Visa or M/C. I always pay by Amex if I can as it is where I accumulate points to be used in the future for upgrades etc. As this was a significant amount the points are down the drain. The hotel should correct those 3rd party travel agencies to accurately reflect how payments can be made. The manager continually said this was the hotel system, but failed to understand that the correct information needs to be available to all however they booked. My guess is the hotel wants to save a few dollars on commission fees.\nFor SGD 1,000 per night this was extremely poor value for money. We won't be booking again.",

      "positive": "The pool. It is indeed exceptional. Quite crowded, but was still ok and special. \nThe view from the pool to both sides. The view from our bedroom harbour view.\nThe room was very good quality, automated curtains was a nice detail. \nAs we stayed only 1 night we decided to eat at the pool. Tried the bar by the pool but was full without a reservation. The food menu at the pool was limited and just snacks but was ok and worth to enjoy the sun going down and lights turning on. Again, the real highlight of our stay.\nIf you wonder which room, and which view to pick, I liked very much the harbour one seeing all the cargo boats stopped at the bay. It was quite high to appreciate the light show of the gardens imo. We saw a bit of the show from the pool (only 10 floors above our room) and was nothing special. The show could be nicer from the gardens themselves or maybe from  lower floor. Have in mind though there's a motorway between the hotel and the gardens by the bay, so if not high enough could be a bit of a nuisance. \nWe visited the gardens at night and was great. No attractions open though.",
      "negative": "The check-in experience was unbelievable horrible, for the price per night, and the reason I'm rating it so low. First the stress starts when receiving a msg saying we have to prebook a checkin time and access to the pool. I remembered about that just the day before while we are also doing all other things for travelling. Sent the sms requested, no confirmation. Sent msg on booking.com, no answer, tried to call the number given on booking, NO ANSWER!, sent an email to the email they gave on the message in case we have issues with the booking a check-in slot, and the person just says yes you have to book through these links FAILING TO MENTION I NEEDED A RESERVATION CODE (not the booking.com one) to book the slots for checkin and pool. I do the reservation on the links provided using the booking.com reserv. code. Seems I booked as it says the booking was successful.\nHowever when I got to the hotel, seems needed to have received an SMS with a queue number that I never got. Because turns out my booking needed a reservation code from the hotel I never got. So the staff in front of the check-in counters does a new booking again for me and again I don't receive the SMS (don't know why) but I took a picture of my queue number from his tablet screen and all good. We were sent to the other tower (we arrived and 1 and were going to stay and had to do the check-in at tower 3). Then still waited about 30min but then the lady was really nice and it was not an issue at all to also book the pool.\nIn fact there are no time slots for the pool, we can go when we want, just need to register first and get a number to show at the entrance.\nSo, so much crap about register here and there, when actually IS NOT NEEDED TO BOOK CHECK-IN AND POOL IN ADVANCE. All can be done upon arrival.\nThe check-out was smoother, still to get a taxi to the airport was quite a mess. Think could be better organised there.",

The staff, food and drinks were fabulous but regularly sitting next to crying babies and young children misbehaving and throwing the sugar packets on the ground was not ideal and took the shine away.  It did not feel like the luxurious and exclusive Club in the sky overlooking one of the most prettiest cities in the world that we were expecting given the price tag.....instead it was like ‘family night at the local’ for the rich.",

We are not sure if the room was upgraded or not, but the room was fabulous and it was the best hotel room we’ve ever stayed (I’d recommend to book the sky view room). The “special amenity” was so nice and tasty. :) We were also recommended the restaurant “Cut,” and we enjoyed it a lot. Room-service foods were very tasty too.

To be honest, we only cared about the infinity pool, so it didn't excite us so much at the reception. Unlike some reviews, the check-in process was very fast. We checked in at Tower 3, so that might be a reason. If someone wants to check in quickly, perhaps better to try Tower 3 check in counter instead of Tower 1.\nAs we entered the room, we were totally blown away how different the suite is. It is massive and have views on both sides of the building. The living room and the bed room face the bay area. The bath room faces the Gardens by the Bay. Honestly, the view from the bathroom was better than what we could see from the roof top.\nNonetheless to say that the infinity pool was great. We were lucky to be there when it wasn't so full. We had plenty of opportunities to take nice photos and videos.\nWe used the gym on Tower 2. It was compact, but not so full, so we didn't have any problem. The view from the gym was quite good because it is on the 55th floor.\nGardens by the Bay is right next to it, so if someone wants to visit, it's great too. Plenty of restaurants from nice expensive ones within the hotel to cheap ones in the convention centre right next to it. There were plenty of shops too if someone is into shopping.\nWe got to know that the suite was not just double the size. It really gives some extra. It is highly recommended if you are there for honey moon or anniversary.",

The room was well worth it with the warm clean decor, automatic curtains, spacious double sink bathroom and shower, and the bed was just right. The infinity pool was spectacular especially at sundown. The restaurants were great! Loved the high tea dimsum at Blossom and early dinner at Ce la Vi where the staff made the best recommendations. The access to the shopping malls, gardens and public transportation was perfect. This was around the time social distancing and quarantines were recommended and the hotel was very organized and prepared with hand sanitizers, alcohol wash, offering masks, well managed temperature check entrance/exits, and frequent cleaning including the public spaces.",

The pool area was considered half empty but for me it was still a lot of people, but there's a note somewhere not to expect serenity. It's good that the view made up for it.",

He made my stay unforgettable on the 47th floor since he has offered the best rooms to us! \nAnd one more assistant at night at the opposite reception desk was very careful, not very young man, I guess it was after 10 PM. We had a problem with our order delivery, I asked a girl to help but she waved away from me like - I don’t know, call the delivery by yourself and bla bla. The man heard it and started to help me by explaining things, then he called to food delivery service, then to the restaurant, then asked to wait for us, then printed the address. It was like a remarkable and unexpected experience! He was waiting us to be back to learn that everything is ok and we have grabbed our food. Great thanks and appreciation to him.

There are plenty of places to eat and shops within MBS, Gardens By the Bay or a short MRT ride away at either City Hall or Orchard Rd. All the hotel staffs are friendly and helpful, excellent service throughout our stay.",

From time to time you get a I personally liked the bigger pool (the one in the middle) for swim and take some pano pics. Although, the smaller ones is less crowded, if you prefer. From time to time the staff will serve free drinks and ice creams. In case of lightning you will be asked to leave the pool for safety reasons. \n- Staff: super friendly and polite. \n- Check in: Book yours in advance (online). They will be waiting for you at the correct time and in matter of minutes you are all set.\n- Check out: complete hassle free. if you have no outstanding debts, you just drop your key in the auto check out and done!  \n- We had also the breakfast buffet at level 1. Great service and good variety of food.\n- You can also visit the Observatory deck for free. Great view of the city. ask for info at Tower 3 entrance.\n- Overall...yes it is expensive but it's worth it. It was a great experience.\n   Hope you enjoy! Cheers",

But Taxis were inexpensive and a great was to see all of the beautiful architecture.\nFor pandemic reasons we had to make a reservation to go to the pool, but they made that very easy. Under the hotel is a huge mall with a food market, the iconic Apple Store and every shop you could think of. It is a short walk to the famous gardens. We never ate dinner in the hotel because we were having fun discovering the city. But drinks on the rooftop was fun and they offer a western breakfast if fish soup in the morning is not your thing. There was also a bakery in the lobby where we got our coffee and croissant to get going in the morning. We had a waterfront harbour view room on the 49th floor looking over the gardens, but I can imagine that the city view was also great. Especially at night.

      "positive": "- The facilities, especially the roof, are very stunning and in excellent shape, very clean and well maintained, etc. The view to both garden/ocean and to the city skyline is truly amazing, so is the location of the hotel\n- The room was beautiful and cozy, pretty design, well cleaned, comfy beds. Bathroom spacious and luxurious\n- Infinity Pool on the roof certainly an experience. Strange was that we had to reserve access via text message (c'mon, we are in 2022). Later I discovered that they also have a web link for it, strange that they don't tell you this...\n- Gym on the 55th floor with an amazing view on the city",
      "negative": "- Huge & busy hotel, thus no personalized service, rather quite an \"industrialized\" experience\n- You can feel that they mainly benefit from being well known, so they are not really trying hard to make you feel welcome as a guest\n- Breakfast on both the roof and the first floor was really bad for a 5 star hotel: everything way to sweet (even the juices, so not natural) and/or full of fat, coffee was tasting like some drinking a bath gel, staff rather unfriendly\n- It would be good to be able to turn off the AC completely in the room, it got quite cold in the night.\n- The availability of jacuzzis on the roof is extremely limited, whenever we went to the pool they were fully crowded\n- They send you a survey link right after check-in that expires after just 12h. Guests have other things to do than completing surveys when arriving, so if they are really genuinely interested in early customer feedback (which could be quite relevant...) they should grant more time for answering.\nAfterwards, I never heard back of them to provide feedback.\n- When we wanted to go for a late dinner on the roof after arrival, they rejected us saying no children allowed at this time because supposedly there was a DJ at work. Seriously? What a shame to send us away due to some stupid rules.",

There was no way to have breakfast to the point that another lady in front of us made a scene complaining about getting a table and being hungry. She eventually got her table but I wasn't in the mood to loose my dignity in order to get a sit in the restaurant. \nAs no other options were available in the hotel I had to order a delivery, the staff refused to send the food to my room and therefore I had to go pick it up at reception which might sound like nothing but I assure you that hotel is huge and it takes 15-20 minutes walking to get to the reception from the Pool area if the elevators are free.\nThe team was rude in this sense as they did not acknowledge that we could not have breakfast at their facilities as the restaurants were full and the room service gave a delivery time of 1 hour and 1/2.  This really messed up our morning and I was far from happy.",

Also they brought to our room always some surprise like some chocolate or sweets - which was extremly good. the view from room is very nice from both side - garden or city view. very large tv in room. too many options restaurants in all hotel complex. \nbar ce lavie was very nice - they gave us table even if we didnt make reservation- probably because it was first day opening.",

From watching several programmes about the hotel and speaking to a number people, being on our honeymoon we expected the room to be dressed with some form of welcome but it wasnt which was very disappointing. Later on we were sent 6 chocolates. During our stay our key pad on the door failed. Whilst the security and maintenance guy who addressed the situation were extremely friendly and pleasant we were left locked out of our room for  quite some timeand were sat on the floor at one point. As the hotel continues to state how they go over and obove for guests, I expected at some point they may have sent us for a coffee whilst we waited but there was no offer. There was also mould in the shower which suggests it wasn't been cleaned thoroughly. I do not feel the customer service we received reflected the price or what is shown and offered on programmes etc. We have been elsewhere with better customer service for the fraction of the price.",

The signs by the edge of the pool say ages 13 up however there were families with multiple kids splashing and screaming and snorkelling in the pool. not exactly relaxing and there should be more of an adults only section. limited breakfast options without paying $45+ per person.",
