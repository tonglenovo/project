Wanted to try eating asking for room service so we can order meals for dining inside the room but, no worries, we enjoyed the free refreshments at Towers Club that came complimentary with our booking.",

Pour comparaison, le buffet du Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa nous a coûté 157sgd (et en plus il était gratuit pour notre fils alors que les enfants ont un buffet rien que pour eux).\nDernier point négatif : certains membres de l'équipe sont très peu aimables.

And the last 2 days in city view still charges us 320 per day! unbelievable!\nWe asked for city view price of the other 2 nights because we have not stayed in the pool view room. We spend 3 nights in the lower price city view room and we still have to pay the pool view price?\nThe funny thing was they said they could offer us a 40 SDG discount of the last 2 nights, which was actually how much the city view room was charged. Unbelievable!\nThey called this discount like they were doing a nice favor to us.\nToo ridiculous to have any more word to say.\nI had to ended the check out as soon as possible so I could head to our next hotel, Mandarin Oriental, which was spectacular. I wish I should have gone there at first place so I didn’t have to be this disappointed...\n.",

Die Ausstattung war hervorragend (und exakt so wie auf der Website des Hotels gezeigt), die kleine Küche inkl. Kühlschrank, Kaffeemaschine etc. war ein schönes Extra (und täglich neu mit Wasserflaschen und Kaffeekapseln befüllt), die Ankleide hätte auch für 6 Personen gereicht. Die Beleuchtung im Zimmer ist durchdacht und vielfältig einstellbar, es war unglaublich ruhig, die Betten waren bequem, die vielen Sitzgelegenheiten im weitläufigen Zimmer machen auch einen \"Hoteltag\" zum Ausruhen zwischendurch angenehm. Wir haben nichts vermisst.\nHotel-Annehmlichkeiten:\nErstaunlich kinderfreundlich, ohne ein \"Familienhotel\" zu sein! Die Kinder-Wasserspielwelt \"Splash\" ist nicht riesig, hat aber für kleine und große Kinder was zu bieten und ist eine tolle Ergänzung zum Pool, wir waren fast jeden Tag da (in Corona-Zeiten kann man jeden Tag 1x 1h Slot dort buchen). Die Indoor-Spielwelt \"Buds\" ist ebenfalls liebevoll gestaltet, für größere Kids aber eher langweilig, und kostet pro Session einen kleinen Aufpreis. Das Kinder-Kochstudio, das es ebenfalls gibt, sah toll aus, haben wir aber nicht ausprobiert.\nFür die Erwachsenen gab es dann die Horizon Lounge im 24. Stock, wo Kinder Mo-Fr erst ab 12 willkommen sind (Wochenends gibt es dort sogar extra Kinderbesteck, Bücher etc.) - das war für meine Frau und mich eine schöne Gelegenheit, in ruhigem Ambiente ein paar leckere Häppchen zu essen und einen leckeren Tropfen zu trinken.\nDie Origin Bar macht herausragend gute Drinks, die auch nicht teurer sind als gute Drinks in der Stadt (20+ SGD).\nDas Frühstück in \"The Line\" ist super vielfältig.\nLage: Das Hotel ist ein paar Fußminuten vom Ende der Orchard Road entfernt, dort gibt es auch direkt eine Bushaltestelle, von der aus man zügig weiter kommt (auch zur MRT). Für manche Ziele ist es wg.",
      "negative": "Mir fällt nur eine Sache überhaupt ein: Salz- und Pfeffermühlen statt Papierpäckchen in \"The Line\" wären toll - evtl. ist das aber auch noch eine Corona-Maßnahme, ich habe nicht nachgefragt.\nAuf der anderen Seite gibt es so viel 5*-Service ungefragt on top, wie zum Beispiel überraschend eine Geburtstagstorte für ein Geburtstagskind in der Familie aus der hauseigenen Konditorei, dass mir dieser Punkt am Ende wirklich schnuppe war :)",

They had to repeatedly go back to the duty manager - Andreas - to get updates on the room delay and what could be done to keep us comfortable while waiting (frankly, nothing much except a \"welcome drink\" at The Line). The duty manager didn't even have the courtesy to come out and speak to us to explain the situation despite us waiting for ~3hrs. To make things worse, when we eventually headed to the room (after 6pm), it was already time for the kids' dinner, and we had to do in-room dining service. The food delivered had missing items (e.g., chicken congee with no chicken in it, chicken biryani with missing papadams) and is a poor representation of Asian cuisine tastiness (obviously prepared with Westerners in mind). We had to follow up repeatedly for things. Breakfast at The Line was another \"surreal\" experience altogether. We had not even stepped into the restaurant yet (and we were standing with 2 kids) and the front desk staff was already telling us that we need to leave in an hour's time. Frankly, very disappointed with the whole experience esp. given the price we paid and service we got.

It has a nice size, but I guess it is normal in that segment.

I was a bit dissapointed by this, especially after having read good reviews about it. Also I felt a bit rushed at the checkout, as I was asking if it was possible to check out a tad later and they made quite a big deal about checking out at 12:30. Also we had a small incident with the food at the lounge; while everybody was apologizing a hundred times they could have handled the situation better; e.g. by sending a small card or gesture to the room. I am a frequent traveller, so these little - personal - things make the difference for me between a good stay and an excellent stay.",

She just did all she needed to do for checkin, and she didn't explain locations of the gym, availability of breakfast, and what other facilities and services available in the hotel (there was no one to guide us to the room perhaps because of Covid, so I expected her to explain all this). There seemed to be additional services available at Valley Wing but we already checked out when we learned them.",

The bed was very comfortable, and we slept like babies :) the blackout curtains did a serious job of blocking any light. The coffee pods provided in the room were rich and aromatic. The bathtub was nice as well, as was the rain shower. The breakfast was alacarte, but sufficed the purpose. Things could get a little tricky for vegetarian guests, but we managed fine with the given options on offer. We strolled down to Orchard occasionally, and also walked around the property.

We did not need to order food as the array of food and well-spaced timing from breakfast to afternoon tea to canapes kept us filled. The room was such a joy to be in especially when they considered that we had children with us and had decorated the room with a teepee and children's activity bags. It was made even more special when I received a cake for my birthday even without being told. \nWe also appreciate the staff who served us during afternoon tea and canapes who were very helpful in ensuring we were served food items which were halal. \nNot to mention, the kids enjoyed all the available activities at the hotel. We simply stayed put at the hotel and did not leave the entire 3 days 2 nights we were there because everything was available. What more, our Valley Wing room was so comfortable and kept neat and clean daily.\nWe felt well-rested after our entire stay. We'll be coming back for sure.",
