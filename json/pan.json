The room was spacious with well appointed lighting, there were power sockets with USB charging and HDMI ports.  Our USB charging outputs did not work, but we are prepared for those moments by taking a multi power box with USB charging and plenty of adaptors (UK fittings for SG).  There is only one power socket beside the bed so you need an extra long cord if you want to charge your devices from the bedside without a power socket.  There were two phones in the room if your using the work station. The real treat is the shower, 3 types to choose from, rain, spa and hand.  Hotel location is perfect with corridors to the shopping malls, MRT Promenade is a 5 min walk.  Here is the small things that need improvement, room service is too slow, it took an hour for a toasted sandwich and the order was still wrong, the trolley sat outside the room for near to 24 hrs, I took it back to reception.  You dont get any reward points unless you book direct.  My partner had strained a knee muscle and the team was amazing and caring we got all the support needed.  However sometimes you need to explore your requests a little more deeply with the right person in order to get what you reasonably need, ask to speak to someone who knows the system a bit better.

Sowas nervt schon beim 3 Mal, aber 10 Mal....\nDesweiteren fragt man sich oft, wofür genau an manchen Einrichtungen Personal stationiert wird, wie z.B. im Fitnesscenter. Hier stehen 2 Mitarbeiter die sich miteinander unterhalten. Es gibt keine Einführung in die Geräte für Gäste oder sont irgend etwas was man als Service am Gast bezeichnen könnte (Getränke oder Handtücher könnten evt. gerreicht werden!?). Nach 5 Minuten im Fitnesscenter sind die 2 Herren dann auch rausgegangen um ihren Smalltalk mit dem Poolpersonal zu vertiefen und nach 15 Minuten war von den 3 Mitarbeitern weit und breit nichts mehr zu sehen für die nächste Stunde. Ich möchte auch den General Manager herzlich einladen, doch mal auf seinen Poolliegen, ganz besonders den Cabanas, Platz zu nehmen.

Туристов много, но карты достопримечательностей отсутствуют. Доступ на этажи только по карте - если вы живете на 24 этаже, то на последний этаж (посмотреть панораму) и в клуб наверху вас не пустят. Ну что за чушь, а?! Можно подумать на этажах ниже отель не 5 звезд, а 3.

We requested for the one that I stayed in before, the one as shown on the website, but its actually full and only available the next day. Ok, so we waited until the next day to change our room.  3pm is the hotel’s check-in time so I expected this room to be ready! But no, turned out something was wrong with the tub and fixing.... so we waited and waited... 2hrs passed, still not fixed!!! “Luckily” another guest checked out and we finally got the room type requested.  But the plans for the rest of the night were all changed because of this, my kids were all crazy during the 2hrs wait.... and we were not a bit compensated",

If you want cutlery, you have to take it yourself at the Pacific Marketplace. Can't the disposable cutlery packs be placed in the more premium rooms and suites?

Just for ice! 5-star hotel and you have to carry a bucket of ice from the first floor to the 30th floor. For a suite, the amenities and facilities are lacklustre and not well-maintained: JBL speaker in the room malfunctioned after one day. Tap in the small bathroom leaked non-stop (faulty amenities like leaky taps are a major cause of water wastage). The fridge is TINY. If you want to chill bottles of sparkling water and wine it's gonna be a struggle. There was a small piece of something on the bathroom stall that remained there FOR 3 DAYS, and because I had some groundnuts, there were some debris on the carpet WHICH WERE STILL THERE THE NEXT DAY even after the room had been made up, it had not been vacuumed.

On top of that there was an extremely poor management of the situation and social distancing rules were not enforced. There were no staff available to manage the queues and ensure that guests stood 1m apart.\nFurthermore, I was assigned a twin bed room even when I booked a king bed room. This was on top of the fact that they still had king bed rooms available. I went to my room after receiving my keys only to realise that it was a twin bed room. Went back down to the reception to ask why this was the case and it turns out that they were trying to push out the twin rooms first even though there were still king bed rooms available. Had to request for a change but at least I managed to get the king bed room that I booked.",

Even though I had given my room number, and had left my laptop at the table, a (korean) staff member ran after me when I tried to go to the restroom. She accused me of trying to leave without paying , even though I was headed away from the exit . I don't know if it was my ethnicity (Indian) or the fact that I loooked like I had lost a boxing match, it was clear that she was only motivated my appearance. The aggressiveness of her behaviour suggested that she had been trained to behave in this manner towards people who looked like me.\nUpon checkout,I once again experienced this contemptuous hostility with the lady at the reception. She kept cutting me off and raising her tone in a very dismissive manner. When She was tagging my baggage which I wanted to leave in storage for a few hours, she handed me my ticket. I waited to ensure that she put the other half of the ticket in my suitcase (I was going to take 3 flights in the next day and a half and did not want to risk any slip-ups with my left luggage). She stared at me pointedly with an expression of  irritation and literally \"shoo'ed\" me waving the back of my hand like one might do to an animal or a beggar on the street. Again this seemed to be normal behaviour to her, at least towards people who looked like me.\nFinally when I came to pick up my bag, the porter said he could not find it and that I was not allowed to go inside to identify my bag. When I asked him what he proposed to about it he just shrugged.  When I entered the forbidden zone and pointed out my bags he slammed them into the taxi boot so violently and angrily that the driver came out to see if there was damage to the car!!\nIt's clear that at the Pan Pacific one is given treatment based one's appearance.

In addition, the room is probably the smallest of all rooms on the floor (ca. 1.5m shorter versus the other rooms on the floor...). Therefore, the bathroom was small for two people.

He should ask the guest in the queue instead if they need help in any ways. This is because I was in the queue alone while the rest of my family members were seating at the couch.

After finding a half drunk iced tea in the fridge, we called guest services to find out whether our\nroom had been cleaned. They sent a staff member up who scoffed at throwing the half drunk item away. We could have thrown it away\nourselves but we wanted to know that the room had been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival. This isn’t a cheap hotel and cleanliness\nshould go without saying. They said it had been cleaned and I think it had been done, just not thoroughly because I also found part of a\npainted toe-nail on the floor of the toilet area.\nRoom service was ordered at 9pm and didn’t arrive until 10pm - the chicken wings were warm and the chips (‘truffle fries’) were cold.\nNot to mention, the fries were $18! Truly, that’s extortion! There were only enough chips to cover around one large potato with finely grated\nParmesan cheese over the top! We called to advise about the cold chips and the hotel did offer to bring a replacement but we were very\nhungry and didn’t want to wait another hour. The hotel did remove the charge off our account which was appreciated but if the service staff\ncared to do so, they could easily check the status of the food before delivery to the guest - it was easy to tell the chips were cold because\nthe plate was cold to touch.\nAfter check out, we wanted to sit in one of the pods to wait for our taxi, but we were given clear instructions that we would have to move\naway from the pod if they needed it for another party. To be clear, the pod wasn’t reserved, it’s just that we (a couple) weren’t going to be\nordering a lot of drinks so would have to move out if a bigger party came along (this particular pod had four individual chairs and a table).",

We returned after the couple of years od covid lockdown expecting the hotel to be the same as the pre-covid days. The hotel itself is the same and the Club suites are just as they used to be. The location of the hotel is still superb. The staff at the Club lounge (eg Shine, Macluther are still there and doing a wonderful job as they always have. A lovely group of professional and attendtive staff - who have become friends over the years). We stayed for 2 weeks. But the experience was very disappointing. The new management of the Hotel really does need to lift its game in the benefits it provides to guests paying for Club access, otherwise guests will find an alternative hotel that proves them with what they expext from a 5 star hotel.",
      "negative": "If you stay here for a day or 2 in a Club room it may be OK. But if you stay for 2 weeks then it is definitely a disappointing and underwhelming experience - unlike the pre-covid days. Managment really does need to sit up and pay attention to the expectations of guests who pay tens of thousands of dollars to stay in a Club suite and expect better than what they are currently getting. The problem is that no longer can you go to the Club and have a relaxed breakfast away from the hustle and bustle and screaming kids on the third floor. Then when you go to the Club for afternoon tea, the food never changes  - it is essentially the same every day. Doesn't take long to tire of it if you are there for an extended period. The same goes for evening canapes. Each night was essentially the same - a platter with the same food - some cherry tomatoes, some grapes, couple of pieces of cheap cheese and crackers, some olives, the same small pieces of cake and some fried chicken (sometimes alternated with some other hot dish) but essentially the same every night. And you can't choose your own food but have to take what is given = even if it is not what you want. This is so different to the pre-covid days when dishes changed daily - there was always a wonderful selection of cheese, fruits, bread, hot dishes and desserts. As it stands it is really not worth the cost of paying for Club priviliges when the food selection is so poor. We thought this may all be due to Covid - until I read a review of someone who stayed at the Intercontinental Robertson Quay at about the same time as we stayed at the Pan Pacific. They wrote: \"We wanted a quiet, relaxing time and to be spoilt in the club. We have not been disappointed. This is our ninth night and every day the afternoon tea has been varied and delicious. The evening canape snacks have also changed nightly and are of a high standard.\" This is how it used to be at the Club the PanPacific.",

City Hall MRT station enables you to get to Orchard Road shopping via rail. The pool area is a great place to rest at the end of the day, with plenty of seating around the pool. Stayed in a Harbour View Studio on the 32nd level which was a beautifully appointed room, spacious in size, had a great bath and views of the Marina Bay harbour. Good choice of breakfasts & coffee from the Marketplace and the bar in the Atrium is a great place to have a drink at the end of the day. Enjoyed the dinner buffet at the Edge Restaurant, where there were at least 10 different food stations, with an amazing range of food options including seafood, such as oysters, lobster & grilled octopus.

The breakfast was fine but I always wonder why hotels don't change the offering a bit, as it can get a bit same day after day (we stayed 6 nights). This is nothing to do with the hotel, but places in Singapore can be quite hard to find, if you are looking for slightly off-the-beaten-track places I'd recommend phoning ahead to get clearer directions as apple/google maps doesn't always pinpoint places as well as you'd hope!",

Nestled amongst the two big malls with attractions such as Gardens by the Bay, MBS, etc were excellent.  By virtue of its location, the view in my Pacific Harbour View room was therefore understandly to die for!  Room was cosy and right sized.  Love the abundance of light. TV was placed well, good size and efficient.  The power points in the room were also considerately placed.  On service quality, we did not wait long to be checked in.  We felt very welcome as someone came to usher us to an available counter.  Information was provided and our request was attended to very quickly.  I see the consistency in service quality from the management staff to housekeeping and to those in the front line.  The ambience in Pan Pacific Singapore is very drawing.  The lobby itself has very generous space to chill.  Feels like a home really.  The fact that every corner presents a place to chill or consume something is pretty exceptional.  I will definitely return.",

Except may be the carpet look a bit not so \"cool\"!\nLocation is perfect, well connected to Marina square, Suntec City, Millennium Walk, South Beach, Raffles City are all within walking distance.",
      "negative": "Hair dryer - I seriously hate the hair dryer. Air is too hot and very difficult to use. I wish the hotel can provide a Dyson hair dryer. \nIroning board and iron - May be the hotel can consider upgrade to those handy steam iron. There are some small handheld steam iron available in the market which doesn't cost a lot of money and save the space for storing the ironing board as well.",
