Probably the best I have come across having stayed in multiple 5* hotels in SG (e.g. Shangri-La Orchard, MBS etc).  Cheers to Cally who was on night shift and very kind in attending to my 2am room mishap.  Zabid from the front office for making every effort to take care of our family's needs, and Isabelle from the Club lounge.\nFood and drinks (wine / Singapore Sling) at the Club Lounge was excellent.\nClub lounge feels much more premium than the one at MBS which is quite a circus (crowded and can be noisy).  Ritz caters to more professional business guests, and the ratio of staff / tables to club lounge members make the experience feel much more premium than the Level 55 club lounge at MBS.\nView and privacy is definitely better than the Valley Wing experience at Shangri-La which is on the 1st floor next to the reception and can be rather distracting with people walking past.\nRooms are immaculately maintained (for the age of property), and very beautiful - especially those facing the marina bay.\nIf you have kids, remember to ask them to do the Ritz Kids experience which was a nice touch to reward my daughter for completing the quest with a nice scoop of ice cream from Colony restaurant.",

We thought it was the humidity and the lockdown led to temporary smell but at the end of our check out we realised that might very well be a smoking room which was why the smell doesn’t go away after days.\nPoor communication at check in and lack of solution at the lobby desk. We were not told at the check in that no buffet or dine-in breakfast will be served due to covid situation. Instead we were told S$48 per pax for breakfast. We woke up late and the young one was super hungry. We went downstairs to the usual restaurant Colony for breakfast and was told by the cleaning ladies there that no breakfast will be served but only at Club floor. At the hotel lobby, when I was asking the concierge desk, we were told that only order in was available and it will take at least 30mins if they help to expedite the orders. When I told them the need for my little one to get food, the ladies busy calling around but offered no option as to what they can do to resolve the issue. I offered to go up to the club floor with immediate access to food for my little one and we will happily pay for it and no feedback or decision. After a long time, the lobby manager Douglas came to facilitate and offered immediate pancake ordered for my little one and access to food for us right away.  We were\nAlso well taken care of at the breakfast place, which shows they are really trying to resolve the issue. Overall, I understand the unusual situation led to the mistake to advise your guests, but it really shouldn’t happen to Ritz!",

They only offer a late check out as a compensation. I’m disappointed with the level of service and the hotel’s attitude towards serving individual  leisure guests like me. \nAlso I was not expecting staff from 5 star hotel to step into the room with their shoes on!

Simply one of the most attentive staff teams that I have seen while traveling through 68 different countries. It's hard to rate the price/quality of this place because once the quality goes this high, you can wonder how you put a price tag on it. One suggestion for anyone looking for a relaxed stay in this place...add the lounge option to your room reservation.

The food was excellent, the cocktails well made and the staff all took time out to chat with us regularly.\nI asked for a banana smoothie one night and they sent down to the kitchen for it, nothing was too much trouble.

      "negative": "While the drinks were great at the executive lounge, the food needs to be improved . We stayed for 6 days and saw the same food day in and day out with very few exceptions. When we asked if we could take breakfast in the main restaurant, hoping for a better selection, we were told that would come at an additional cost. We have never experienced this in executive clubs of other hotel chains. It was always an option where breakfast could be taken.\nThe management should also try to move away from the use of small plastic bottles near pool and in the room",

And knowing that its my birthday on that day, the hotel gave me a piece of cake with handwrittened greeting note from the manager which made my day very special.

I didn’t give perfect score for the staff because the front desk staff closest to me saw me waiting and opted to walk to the other side of the waiting area to serve the guest who just walked in.
