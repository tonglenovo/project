We didn't have the food we wanted to eat there, but we still paid for it. :(\nThey hold us deposit $2600 even when we had checked out. And gave us excuses too busy to do the refund. So I had to send a complaint email. They even tried to overcharge us $300 more. I just checked out the hotel today on 25 Dec 21 and the deposit of $2600 was not settled yet. Still waiting for response from them. Now it is 5pm. We checked out at 1pm today.",

The whole thing about JW makes me wanting to have another staycay next weekend.  The Customer Relation who attended us named Sarah üòâ was so determine to ensure that we had an appropriate and comfortable room for my family which we couldn't reserve at first.  It was a room upgrade! with the view and comforting king size bed, So happy and contented with everything but only if they could have the restaurant to be halal certified i would love to have breakfast with the hotel but no worries we were ok.  Thank you team JW.",
