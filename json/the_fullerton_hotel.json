However, the steaks (all three offerings are the same steak, just differently prepared) we had were poorly prepared (we ordered the Cajun style and they were just normal steaks), presented in an odd manner (on a cold slate tile plate), cooked incorrectly (ordered both medium-well and received both at a touch over rare, medium rare at best) and very fatty.\nAs this bar isn't actually part of the Fullerton, then this is not a poor mark against them, but since the bar is in the hotel lobby, it could be mistaken as part of the hotel and guests may get the wrong impression.",

Most of the staff at the concierge was rude, not organised and not approachable. While waiting for check-in/out, there was no proper queue and the staff seem to enjoy letting their guest wait. Their tone was not friendly and they were not welcoming at all. During check out, it was crowded and only 3 out of the 5 counters were available. After waiting for about 15minutes, finally an unfriendly staff pointed to a small mail box and said, \"if you don't want to wait, you just drop your card into the express checkout. Otherwise you have to wait.\" oh my goodness! The words for express checkout was too small to be visible! Only the staff who finally served me for check-in was helpful. We've booked for high tea on our check out day and she had made the necessary arrangements for late check out and 3 tables for our family for high tea. But on Sunday, we were told by the high tea section that we are not allowed to dine there because we are a family. And the manager was exceptionally rude to my husband, calling out to him \"Hey, boss.\" as though the manager had no proper training in greeting their guests. And why as a family, we can't have high tea there? We didn't say we want to sit together. Worse still, we have made a reservation!\nMy room had a good view, was clean. But there was no table for having tea, nor a long mirror to check for my dressing.... This should be basic.",

Called the reception and was told it was fully booked but when I went to take a look, there was not a single person using it. I feel it is good to have staff at swimming pool area to clear out unused towels else they could help allocate space for people. Also went to the pool at around 7pm and there were a lot of crows flying by to take a sip of water from the pool.\n4) room was not really very sound proof as we could hear the bass of speakers from other rooms. \n5) Most disappointing was the ala carte buffet breakfast. I feel that the quantity could be in smaller portion so guests are able to really enjoy the buffet spread. Ordered laksa with a huge portion but comes with only a single prawn for the price of the buffet, it seemed a little ridiculous. \nThe stay overall was okay but we are expecting a lot from fullerton and feel that the stay can be made much better.",

And I had tried to get a table at the dining space to wait with a coffee, however was told all the tables were reserved. So I sat at the back of the space at an uncomfortable workstation until an hour had passed. When returning to front desk, staff had informed me the room was still not ready. For the money one pays at The Fullerton, this was and is disappointing. \nFinally getting into a room, the experience is mixed. The room features old cabinetry, old tv, and dated interior aesthetic. \nThe blanket was too thick and heavy, which made sleeping uneven. I’d get hot under the covers, then cold when tossing the blanket aside. \nThe facilities are limited due to Covid safety measures, including small dining and drinks options in main ground level after 10 pm. \nIn the evening I ordered a light meal and drinks via delivery app and when returning to my floor, I had kicked and almost tripped on a tray of dishes. Some idiot with no manners and consideration had left their dirty tray in the center of the foyer in front of the elevators. This is not the staff’s fault, but perhaps the hotel should provide explicit instructions to guests who order room service on what to do after they’re finished (if the Fullerton already doesn’t do so).",

The bath tub failed to keep water in the tub because the plug to hold the water in even when pressed fully down still allowed water to escape.\n3. Coffee cups/ curtain were very dirty.\n4. Balcony door looked like a very old garden door. Even to the point where when I put my foot on it to step outside a part of it chipped off. Paint was falling off and both double doors looked worn out.\n5. USB port next to the desk was not working.\n6. The carpet felt and looked very old. Probably has not been changed in a good couple of years.\nOverall I believe that this hotel relies on its history, location and exterior presence to draw people in however not concentrating on the hotel room and leaving them for dead is not the way. In order to bring in more millenniums like myself you guys needs to change the style and design of the rooms. Stop living in the 1990s and create a more simple, clean and modern design to the decor. \nYour staff are amazing and very polite and the customer service was top notch.\nWould I stay here again ? No I would not I would rather save up just a bit more and stay at the marina bay hotel across the way.",

Just in general, we didn’t really feel welcome staying for 2 nights 3 days. It felt very cold.\n2. Pool was a bit underwhelming but that’s just my personal opinion!",

The manager had to tell the counter staff to open more counters when I was in the queue to check out at 12pm (normal check -out time) and the staff hurriedly went behind the counters and wore their blazers. Then the manager proceeded to ask me if I was checking out. After I answered \"yes\", he took the key cards and dropped them into the express check-out box and went to the counters to instruct his staff. I did not even finish talking. He did not even ask if there was anything else I need or just say \"thank you for staying with us\". My husband had to go over to him to tell him that we were not done talking. Then the manager apologised and asked what else did we need. I really did not expect this level of service from a reputable hotel chain. \nI also don't understand why the doormen had to ask if we needed help when they saw that we were lugging a lot of stuff with a baby. They should be asking if they could help because it is already obvious that we needed help?",

      "negative": "I booked a 3D2N stay with Fullerton many months ago. As it is my wedding weekend, I checked if we could ask for an early check-in (just an hour earlier at 2pm) few weeks before the stay. I was told that I have to call in on the day itself to check for the possibility (even though I already told Fullerton it’s my wedding and I may not have the time to do that). A request was put in for me nonetheless. Nearer to date, my sister who also put in a request got a call inviting her to check in as early as 9am (but not me). As it is the COVID period, I definitely wouldn’t be able to leave my stuff in her room as there were restrictions and rules that we have to abide by. So I thought to try my luck again because I wouldn’t have time to call in the morning. When I called, before I could finish what I am requesting for, the staff couldn’t wait to give me a template answer which was to call in from 8-9am for the request. That was when I asked her on the reason for the differential service for their guests. With that, she immediately said that she will transfer my call to the front desk and I was then told I could check in early. \nThe check-in process took quite a while too, and staff wasn’t meticulous. Staff told me that he would be passing me the declaration form so that my husband could be registered. But that didn’t happen. He also told us that extra bed (which we paid for) has already been arranged for my parents’ room but it wasn’t there when we got into the room. We had to give 2 calls to ask for the arrangement before it was finally sorted. \nOverall, the stay was fine. But we should have managed our expectations as we thought the service would be top-notch given the reputation of the Hotel. It definitely didn’t impress me like how many other Hotels (in Singapore) did.",

      "negative": "They gave us a Marina Bay View room at level 7. But the room is poorly light, run-down and the balcony area is small and shows a very small view over Marina Bay, and you have to stand for it. You won’t see a thing when seated on your balcony, enjoying some wine. The room had an old-style look and feel. Very disapointed, i expected fof way better that this at Fullerton and at this price! So i asked and they gave me same room Marina Bay View but on level 6 and that was perfect! Up to my expectations! Gorgous view, soubd proof room, modern and bright! Loved it. Exactly what we expected & paid for, and even better!👍🥂🤗",
