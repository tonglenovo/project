"The service exceeded our expectations! We had pre-ordered transfer from the airport to the hotel with the hotel car service. This was a lot more expensive than other options, but it was wort it! We were met already when we disembarked the plane and followed through immigration and to the baggage hall. And when we arrived at the hotel, we were met by one of the staff who took us to the checkout-in lounge instead of the regular check-in desk. There she arranged for immediate access to our rooms, although it was only 9 am while check-in is at 3 pm. That was highly welcome after a long flight. 
Our luggage was lost and we had to re-arrange our travel plans for the next day, and not only did the hotel arrange for a change in our airport transfer, but we also got late check-out and could keep the room until our departure! This was an unexpected perk, which gave us the possibility to sleep in and rest before our onward travel.
Both macrons and a birthday cake was delivered to our room during the day, with compliments of the hotel as the staff had noticed when registering our passports that it was my husbands birthday four days later.
We had two connecting rooms, which was really nice when traveling with teenagers. The rooms were spacious and with large balconies with view on Gardens by the Bays.

For a hotel I paid INR 50,000+, I atleast didn't expect this kind of stinginess from such a branded and famous hotel. Totally disappointed. No covid kit provided of even atleast basic face mask and sanitizer bottle. The same was provided in my earlier hotel. All eateries closes by 10 PM for a hotel where international passengers arrive 24X7. This was really shocking. I was really left high and dry on this visit at your hotel.

"There were so many rules going to the pool, mostly covid-related so I guess it was not really within control of the hotel, but I think it could have been handled better. We felt like we were being watched like hawks the entire time (at least 10 staff including security, safe distancing officers, pool staff...) and it was not like we were doing anything out of the ordinary/out of line.
They could in general be a little more flexible. It was rainy and there were less than 10 people in the entire pool but we were told strictly to only stay in the section we chose (??) and also were very strict with the 1 hour time limit even though there was no one. 
I know they were just doing their jobs and the staff were nice, but especially considering the rate we paid, it just felt off. Like we were kids under surveillance.",3.5,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,2022,Singapore,Deluxe King City View Room,Was nice enough but not amazing,Couple

"The room that was booked stated that it could accomodate 3 adults and 1 child as I wanted extra comfort for the family, or bring the other daughter in to stay as well when she was able to. IE a 'Deluxe Twin Garden View Room'. And I paid approx 400 SGD extra for such accommodation instead of a 2 adult room. The room certainly could not do this, there were only 2 oversized single beds in the room which could only accommodate 2 adults.
Additionally, the booking stated (on Booking.com), that the Marina Bay Sands accepted all cards, which were duly listed. When I was sent the online payment it only allowed Visa or M/C. I always pay by Amex if I can as it is where I accumulate points to be used in the future for upgrades etc. As this was a significant amount the points are down the drain. The hotel should correct those 3rd party travel agencies to accurately reflect how payments can be made. The manager continually said this was the hotel system, but failed to understand that the correct information needs to be available to all however they booked. My guess is the hotel wants to save a few dollars on commission fees.

"The pool. It is indeed exceptional. Quite crowded, but was still ok and special. 
The view from the pool to both sides. The view from our bedroom harbour view.
The room was very good quality, automated curtains was a nice detail. 
As we stayed only 1 night we decided to eat at the pool. Tried the bar by the pool but was full without a reservation. The food menu at the pool was limited and just snacks but was ok and worth to enjoy the sun going down and lights turning on. Again, the real highlight of our stay.
If you wonder which room, and which view to pick, I liked very much the harbour one seeing all the cargo boats stopped at the bay. It was quite high to appreciate the light show of the gardens imo. We saw a bit of the show from the pool (only 10 floors above our room) and was nothing special. The show could be nicer from the gardens themselves or maybe from  lower floor. Have in mind though there's a motorway between the hotel and the gardens by the bay, so if not high enough could be a bit of a nuisance. 
We visited the gardens at night and was great. No attractions open though.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,2022,Bulgaria,Deluxe King Harbor View Room,"Hellish check-in, heavenly pool",Couple
"The check-in experience was unbelievable horrible, for the price per night, and the reason I'm rating it so low. First the stress starts when receiving a msg saying we have to prebook a checkin time and access to the pool. I remembered about that just the day before while we are also doing all other things for travelling. Sent the sms requested, no confirmation. Sent msg on booking.com, no answer, tried to call the number given on booking, NO ANSWER!, sent an email to the email they gave on the message in case we have issues with the booking a check-in slot, and the person just says yes you have to book through these links FAILING TO MENTION I NEEDED A RESERVATION CODE (not the booking.com one) to book the slots for checkin and pool. I do the reservation on the links provided using the booking.com reserv. code. Seems I booked as it says the booking was successful.
However when I got to the hotel, seems needed to have received an SMS with a queue number that I never got. Because turns out my booking needed a reservation code from the hotel I never got. So the staff in front of the check-in counters does a new booking again for me and again I don't receive the SMS (don't know why) but I took a picture of my queue number from his tablet screen and all good. We were sent to the other tower (we arrived and 1 and were going to stay and had to do the check-in at tower 3). Then still waited about 30min but then the lady was really nice and it was not an issue at all to also book the pool.
In fact there are no time slots for the pool, we can go when we want, just need to register first and get a number to show at the entrance.
So, so much crap about register here and there, when actually IS NOT NEEDED TO BOOK CHECK-IN AND POOL IN ADVANCE. All can be done upon arrival.

You have to book for the Ce La Vie bar at the top. I just want a drink! I understand booking for dinner.

"Going to Singapore?
Stay in MBS of course!
We had only one night here, but that's really all you need for the ""MBS-experience"".
We got to the hotel very early in the morning, before they were able to check us in, but that wasn't really a problem because:
1) we got access to showers before checking in, so we could freshen up,
2) we got access to The Infinity Pool before checking in,
3) we could (of course) leave our bags to be looked after, and
4) they have a system set up so that when our room was ready we got an instant email-notification about this (thumbs up!)
The room was great, the view was great, the hotel is really quite cool. The staff was fantastic. The location is awesome.

"Upon our arrival we got told that we had an upgrade from the standard room to a suite. To be honest, we only cared about the infinity pool, so it didn't excite us so much at the reception. Unlike some reviews, the check-in process was very fast. We checked in at Tower 3, so that might be a reason. If someone wants to check in quickly, perhaps better to try Tower 3 check in counter instead of Tower 1.
As we entered the room, we were totally blown away how different the suite is. It is massive and have views on both sides of the building. The living room and the bed room face the bay area. The bath room faces the Gardens by the Bay. Honestly, the view from the bathroom was better than what we could see from the roof top.
Nonetheless to say that the infinity pool was great. We were lucky to be there when it wasn't so full. We had plenty of opportunities to take nice photos and videos.
We used the gym on Tower 2. It was compact, but not so full, so we didn't have any problem. The view from the gym was quite good because it is on the 55th floor.
Gardens by the Bay is right next to it, so if someone wants to visit, it's great too. Plenty of restaurants from nice expensive ones within the hotel to cheap ones in the convention centre right next to it. There were plenty of shops too if someone is into shopping.
We got to know that the suite was not just double the size. It really gives some extra. It is highly recommended if you are there for honey moon or anniversary.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,2020,Germany,Deluxe King Harbor View Room,Absolutely amazing view from the bath room,Couple

- Pool: Book the pool in advance. You will have 1:15min at the pool per day. And ...yes ... it is amazing. From time to time you get a I personally liked the bigger pool (the one in the middle) for swim and take some pano pics. Although, the smaller ones is less crowded, if you prefer. From time to time the staff will serve free drinks and ice creams. In case of lightning you will be asked to leave the pool for safety reasons. 
- Staff: super friendly and polite. 
- Check in: Book yours in advance (online). They will be waiting for you at the correct time and in matter of minutes you are all set.
- Check out: complete hassle free. if you have no outstanding debts, you just drop your key in the auto check out and done!  
- We had also the breakfast buffet at level 1. Great service and good variety of food.
- You can also visit the Observatory deck for free. Great view of the city. ask for info at Tower 3 entrance.

- Infinity Pool on the roof certainly an experience. Strange was that we had to reserve access via text message (c'mon, we are in 2022). Later I discovered that they also have a web link for it, strange that they don't tell you this...

"- Huge & busy hotel, thus no personalized service, rather quite an ""industrialized"" experience
- You can feel that they mainly benefit from being well known, so they are not really trying hard to make you feel welcome as a guest
- Breakfast on both the roof and the first floor was really bad for a 5 star hotel: everything way to sweet (even the juices, so not natural) and/or full of fat, coffee was tasting like some drinking a bath gel, staff rather unfriendly
- It would be good to be able to turn off the AC completely in the room, it got quite cold in the night.
- The availability of jacuzzis on the roof is extremely limited, whenever we went to the pool they were fully crowded
- They send you a survey link right after check-in that expires after just 12h. Guests have other things to do than completing surveys when arriving, so if they are really genuinely interested in early customer feedback (which could be quite relevant...) they should grant more time for answering.
Afterwards, I never heard back of them to provide feedback.

As no other options were available in the hotel I had to order a delivery, the staff refused to send the food to my room and therefore I had to go pick it up at reception which might sound like nothing but I assure you that hotel is huge and it takes 15-20 minutes walking to get to the reception from the Pool area if the elevators are free.

Nothing I didn't like really. Just restaurants around the area closes too early but we managed to get room service which lasted 50min. At the moment you can only use the infinity pool for 1 hour and 15 min prior reservation. This is due to covid. Hope this change in the future. Restaurants and bars at the top need to be booked several weeks in advance... otherwise you won't be able to just walk in.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,2022,Australia,Deluxe King Garden View Room,Best hotel ever,Couple

"Having to book for the pool time was a little annoying but understandable to make sure it's not too crowded. 
Also make sure you check your pillows out straight away and request some new ones if needed.

"Everything about this hotel was amazing. From all the amenities within this structure. You have a massive casino, several shops, good food variety, and so much more.
For one, if you book the hotel, you also have the opportunity to enjoy the infinity pool facing the city, which is stunning! Also, you have several resturants there too only for hotel guests.
Next, the rooms are elegant. They are massive and come with nice amenities to make your stay perfect.

"Before arriving we had requested a double bed as it was our honeymoon, rather than a twin room. On arrival there were no double rooms but they offered us a late check out of 12pm. From watching several programmes about the hotel and speaking to a number people, being on our honeymoon we expected the room to be dressed with some form of welcome but it wasnt which was very disappointing. Later on we were sent 6 chocolates. During our stay our key pad on the door failed. Whilst the security and maintenance guy who addressed the situation were extremely friendly and pleasant we were left locked out of our room for  quite some timeand were sat on the floor at one point. As the hotel continues to state how they go over and obove for guests, I expected at some point they may have sent us for a coffee whilst we waited but there was no offer. There was also mould in the shower which suggests it wasn't been cleaned thoroughly. I do not feel the customer service we received reflected the price or what is shown and offered on programmes etc. We have been elsewhere with better customer service for the fraction of the price.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,2022,United Kingdom,Deluxe Twin Garden View Room,Very Good,Couple

"We had a deluxe room with a balcony that looked across the marina towards the Marina Sands Hotel.  Our king bed was v comfortable and hard to get out of most days.  The room was spacious with well appointed lighting, there were power sockets with USB charging and HDMI ports.  Our USB charging outputs did not work, but we are prepared for those moments by taking a multi power box with USB charging and plenty of adaptors (UK fittings for SG).  There is only one power socket beside the bed so you need an extra long cord if you want to charge your devices from the bedside without a power socket.  There were two phones in the room if your using the work station. The real treat is the shower, 3 types to choose from, rain, spa and hand.  Hotel location is perfect with corridors to the shopping malls, MRT Promenade is a 5 min walk.  Here is the small things that need improvement, room service is too slow, it took an hour for a toasted sandwich and the order was still wrong, the trolley sat outside the room for near to 24 hrs, I took it back to reception.  You dont get any reward points unless you book direct.  My partner had strained a knee muscle and the team was amazing and caring we got all the support needed.  However sometimes you need to explore your requests a little more deeply with the right person in order to get what you reasonably need, ask to speak to someone who knows the system a bit better.

"Maybe it's the new covid-19 normal where understaffing have caused a lot of problems, but having booked the skyline suite, it's quite unfathomable that there isn't any cutlery available at all in the room, neither can it be delivered to your room at all unless you order in-room dining. If you want cutlery, you have to take it yourself at the Pacific Marketplace. Can't the disposable cutlery packs be placed in the more premium rooms and suites? Some basic forks, knives and spoons and all? Same for ice. If you want ice, you get it yourself from level 1 (bit of a drag when you're at level 30), or pay $5 for it to be sent to your room. Just for ice! 5-star hotel and you have to carry a bucket of ice from the first floor to the 30th floor. For a suite, the amenities and facilities are lacklustre and not well-maintained: JBL speaker in the room malfunctioned after one day. Tap in the small bathroom leaked non-stop (faulty amenities like leaky taps are a major cause of water wastage). The fridge is TINY. If you want to chill bottles of sparkling water and wine it's gonna be a struggle. There was a small piece of something on the bathroom stall that remained there FOR 3 DAYS, and because I had some groundnuts, there were some debris on the carpet WHICH WERE STILL THERE THE NEXT DAY even after the room had been made up, it had not been vacuumed.

On top of that there was an extremely poor management of the situation and social distancing rules were not enforced. There were no staff available to manage the queues and ensure that guests stood 1m apart.
Furthermore, I was assigned a twin bed room even when I booked a king bed room. This was on top of the fact that they still had king bed rooms available.

"The staff at the lobby bar were not so good. Even though I had given my room number, and had left my laptop at the table, a (korean) staff member ran after me when I tried to go to the restroom. She accused me of trying to leave without paying , even though I was headed away from the exit . I don't know if it was my ethnicity (Indian) or the fact that I loooked like I had lost a boxing match, it was clear that she was only motivated my appearance. The aggressiveness of her behaviour suggested that she had been trained to behave in this manner towards people who looked like me.
Upon checkout,I once again experienced this contemptuous hostility with the lady at the reception. She kept cutting me off and raising her tone in a very dismissive manner. When She was tagging my baggage which I wanted to leave in storage for a few hours, she handed me my ticket. I waited to ensure that she put the other half of the ticket in my suitcase (I was going to take 3 flights in the next day and a half and did not want to risk any slip-ups with my left luggage). She stared at me pointedly with an expression of  irritation and literally ""shoo'ed"" me waving the back of my hand like one might do to an animal or a beggar on the street. Again this seemed to be normal behaviour to her, at least towards people who looked like me.
Finally when I came to pick up my bag, the porter said he could not find it and that I was not allowed to go inside to identify my bag. When I asked him what he proposed to about it he just shrugged.  When I entered the forbidden zone and pointed out my bags he slammed them into the taxi boot so violently and angrily that the driver came out to see if there was damage to the car!!

"We booked the hotel in March for a 5-day stay 10 months later. We were asked to provide arrival times at the airport, what we did.

It was room #3209, the last room in a row, directly next to the staff/service elevator and staff facilities of that floor and therefore noisy. In addition, the room is probably the smallest of all rooms on the floor (ca. 1.5m shorter versus the other rooms on the floor...). Therefore, the bathroom was small for two people. In addition, the aircondition could not be turned down to acceptable blowing levels. We had to turn it off a lot to ""survive"" in the room.

"If you stay here for a day or 2 in a Club room it may be OK. But if you stay for 2 weeks then it is definitely a disappointing and underwhelming experience - unlike the pre-covid days. Managment really does need to sit up and pay attention to the expectations of guests who pay tens of thousands of dollars to stay in a Club suite and expect better than what they are currently getting. The problem is that no longer can you go to the Club and have a relaxed breakfast away from the hustle and bustle and screaming kids on the third floor. Then when you go to the Club for afternoon tea, the food never changes  - it is essentially the same every day. Doesn't take long to tire of it if you are there for an extended period. The same goes for evening canapes. Each night was essentially the same - a platter with the same food - some cherry tomatoes, some grapes, couple of pieces of cheap cheese and crackers, some olives, the same small pieces of cake and some fried chicken (sometimes alternated with some other hot dish) but essentially the same every night. And you can't choose your own food but have to take what is given = even if it is not what you want. This is so different to the pre-covid days when dishes changed daily - there was always a wonderful selection of cheese, fruits, bread, hot dishes and desserts. As it stands it is really not worth the cost of paying for Club priviliges when the food selection is so poor. We thought this may all be due to Covid - until I read a review of someone who stayed at the Intercontinental Robertson Quay at about the same time as we stayed at the Pan Pacific. They wrote: ""We wanted a quiet, relaxing time and to be spoilt in the club. We have not been disappointed. This is our ninth night and every day the afternoon tea has been varied and delicious.

The room was spacious and the King bed was large enough to sleep a small child in between the parents. We enjoyed the luxury tea which was available in the room. We were very pleased that the receptionist was able to arrange inter-connecting rooms for us and the parents-in-law. The pool was a very good size and had a shallow part for younger children. The pizza and burger in the poolside bar were of excellent quality. The roundish booths in the downstairs cafe-restaurant were cozy and atmospheric. What a lovely feature. We will always remember them and the delicious cakes. There's a shopping mall adjacent to the hotel which was very handy.

"1) Checked in was delayed till 6pm as apparantly previous occupants probably have not left yet. The UFC 275 was the day before and some of them have not left yet. Was put in a resting room first while waiting for suite. Got locked out from the resting room as we decided to swim while waiting for 6pm. So we waited for 10 mins while still wet for the staff to come up and pass our suite keys.
2) Once suite was given found that the living room aircon was not cold even set to the lowest temperature. Minimum setting was 18.5 degC. Informed the reception about it and somehow the technician managed to change the settings to 15.5 degC which eventually cools the living room.
3) Toilet floor was not levelled properly, water on the floor did not flow to the drain properly creating small puddles and gets slippery for kids. Both toilet mats were eventually wet and soaked.
4) Got locked out from suite after breakfast as 1 of the door lock battery was flat and unable to enter from the other door. 
5) When request for late check out as part compensation of the late check in, they were able to accomodate BUT move to another room. Hence, that was the 3rd room my family was in throughout my 3 days stay. When asked on the reason, staff mentioned that the room was booked for later. However, I also booked the room 1 month prior but I was still checked in late. It makes you think about the difference in treatment if you are a local. I am not a troublemaker hence I accept this as I want my kids to enjoy their stay.
6) Went to pool on the 3rd day and noticed that the staff did not attend to me and my kids. Ended up taking the pool towels myself. Upon observation, noticed the staff approaching other guests willingly and assists them accordingly.
In general, if you are a local, you MAY feel that the treatment is different to foreign guests. But overall it is a great experience as the room is huge.",3.5,Mandarin Oriental,2022,Singapore,City Suite King,Nice place if you can afford it.,Family

Hotel is old especially the rooms. When I entered to room I felt like I went back to 90s. Staff was average. When you are staying at Mandarin Oriental in any country you want to feel like you are staying at Mandarin Oriental. Unfortunately this wasn't the case in Singapore Mandarin Oriental. One of the biggest issues was in our last day there was water dripping from ceiling and when I informed the reception they said they will take care of it. Unfortunately when I went back to room it was still the same. First they said It was coming from the AC but then they said it wasn't which is confusing.

"The rooms are getting a little bit tired... And I'm afraid smelt slightly ""musty"". The robes felt slightly damp... As though they needed airing.

"The restaurant was crap. the service and food were both below par for a 5-star hotel. The lobster mac and cheese had close to NO lobster, completely different from the picture on the menu. It had no seasoning either. I think it was cooked and then reheated. too much garlic as well.
One of the restaurant managers, a man, was making excuses when we asked him, ""Why did the starter come after the main course?"" He said, ""This is just the way we do things. We don't really look at which is the starter or the main. We just go down the list and send out food in that order."" No professionalism at all.
The waiters were walking zombies who also did not have any product knowledge when it came to food. They were not attentive. Only one waiter stood out to us as attentive and polite. He was an elderly gentleman who was not very tall. He carried himself as professionally as possible and always checked on our tables to see if we needed anything. He was more professional and polite than the male manager.

"Overall I do not feel that the service standards met my expectations for a 5 star hotel. The check in staff were curt and unhelpful at check in. We secured a pool slot from 5:30 - 7 pm, and also asked if it was possible to stay at the pool past 7 pm. The staff said that it was not possible, but near the end of our 7 pm slot, the pool was totally empty. It would have cost them nothing to give us an additional slot, since it seemed that there was no one else booked in anyways.
At the pool, service was slow and there was no way to easily order food or drinks. The waiter seemed confused and had to go and retrieve the menu from a QR code inside the building, which took another 30 minutes. This could be easily remedied by having ready QR codes by the pool and coming up with some sort of pool side ordering experience.
We were also looking forward to breakfast at the hotel, but upon check in were told that the only available slot was at 7 am, which felt way too early. No apologies or attempts to help us come up with alternate solutions. We ended up checking out early to eat out at a nearby restaurant.

"Not a 5 star hotel. Waste of my money. Avoid!!
Most staffs are clueless interns or part-time university kids. There are a few sane ones, like the lady at the bar and the guy at the gym. 
The lady whom checked us in was so disengaged and cold; multitasking all the time and has poor service.
Oh, not to mentioned the bellboy, he is Utterly useless! He sat there and played game which we arrived, did nothing but asking folks to do safe-check in. No help. We even saw that they were playing go-cart with the trolley pusher on our way out. No greeting the guests, no offering help. Nothing. 
Breakfast is really subpar. Too expensive for the price. 
All in all, a disappointing stay. You are better off going for intercontinental or Andaz.
Just avoid this place. Overrated",1.5,Hotel Fort Canning,2022,Malaysia,Premium King Room,Poor,Family

"Very disappointed, I had to leave the hotel earlier than expected after 4 nights. I could not stay in there anymore. Several issues, which can be read in other reviews here. Any hotel should not deliver such a poor service to customers. 
Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews carefully prior to my booking. My mistake. Lesson learnt.
The hotel lobby, corridors and in general common areas are totally left without any cleaning in days. 
Food trails left outside the rooms without anyone picking them up for up to 24 hours. 
Room itself was poorly cleaned.  
Most of times reception was unattended. No pick uf of calls.
I understood the hotel was facing problems due to very limited staff available. Probably a pandemic effect.

"We were there at 2plus with 2 toddlers hoping for an earlier check in. To the other extreme, we only managed to collect our keys 10 minutes  past 3pm which is later than the official checked in time and this is only after a few attempts checking with the staff. It was only the latest check with the manager that the room was ready and placed at the side of the reception staff as she was talking to new guests. Just wondering if we will continue to sit down there and wait unnecessarily if we don't check with them again. That sums up a bad start to the day. The situation was worse when I need to go around the whole hotel to just to search for swimming towels. It was shocking that the towels were placed no where near the pool. I walked back to the level two door that I came out from to search for towels after seeing no towels around the pool. I was told by a guest that the towel was taken from basement one. I walked down from level 2 after passing the stretch of hotel with dripping water one level down, out of the glass door near the reception and took that glass lift to basement one, past the b1 carpark before reaching the towel collection point. After taking the towel, I was told that the nearest lift up was not working. I walked past a Caucasian guest asking me where do I get the towel? Can you believe it? Everyone walking around the hotel looking for swimming pool towels that were 3 floors down. (It will be consider fortunate for guests who made their way from the lap pool side and more unfortunate for someone like me who went from the other side , walked one whole round before getting to the correct place. I have to climb 3 storeys up before reaching the lap pool and up the small stairs before eventually reaching the pool where my family was. My wife thought why I went away for so long while she struggled with 2 toddlers in the pool. It's really confusing where there well no bathroom towels nearer to the pool unlike any other hotels.",0.5,Hotel Fort Canning,2022,Singapore,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,Unpleasant experience,Family

"Check-in - 
A request for an early check in(since there is a senior citizen travelling) was met with a curt take a suite for an additional SGD 600, by a front office manager who was not even attending to our issue.
We were given some unwanted information, by the said person, about add on breakfast packages. The way it was put forward was belittling. As if we did not understand the significance of signing off on documents.
No one even bothered to show us to our rooms. We were shown the way to an elevator on request. We had to ask how to work around it, since there was a keycard entry. And exactly 5 minutes later the same gentleman walked another guest to a room right across ours. The only difference this time around, the guest was from a western country. 
It's sad that a property doesn't think a family that is travelling together should be given rooms that are close to each other.
Food - 
Of the 4 days we had breakfast, the spread was exactly the same for 3 days. At SGD 25++ one would expect a little more. The staff at the breakfast was cheerful and on point. 
Location -
Through the location is walkable to MTR's, there is a fair bit of waking up and down a small hillock.
Check-out - 
No bell boy services. No help in getting the luggage out of the lift either. The lift most accessible to the lobby was under maintenance exactly around the check out time.

"The only disappointment (apart from checking out), was that the Fullerton has leased out their former cocktail bar and it is now a whiskey bar called ""Signature Reserve"".  Apart from a massively impressive selection of whiskeys, this bar offers bar snacks and meals. However, the steaks (all three offerings are the same steak, just differently prepared) we had were poorly prepared (we ordered the Cajun style and they were just normal steaks), presented in an odd manner (on a cold slate tile plate), cooked incorrectly (ordered both medium-well and received both at a touch over rare, medium rare at best) and very fatty.
As this bar isn't actually part of the Fullerton, then this is not a poor mark against them, but since the bar is in the hotel lobby, it could be mistaken as part of the hotel and guests may get the wrong impression.",4.5,The Fullerton Hotel,2022,Australia,Premier Courtyard Room,"Brilliant hotel, fantastic position and great old Singaporean style.",Couple
The hotel accidently took $5000 extra from our account.  Which is fine that we had the money but seriously they weren't in a hurry to give it back.

"We've been looking forward to our stay as Fullerton is a beautiful hotel was strong history. However, it was a disappointing experience. Most of the staff at the concierge was rude, not organised and not approachable. While waiting for check-in/out, there was no proper queue and the staff seem to enjoy letting their guest wait. Their tone was not friendly and they were not welcoming at all. During check out, it was crowded and only 3 out of the 5 counters were available. After waiting for about 15minutes, finally an unfriendly staff pointed to a small mail box and said, ""if you don't want to wait, you just drop your card into the express checkout. Otherwise you have to wait."" oh my goodness! The words for express checkout was too small to be visible! Only the staff who finally served me for check-in was helpful. We've booked for high tea on our check out day and she had made the necessary arrangements for late check out and 3 tables for our family for high tea. But on Sunday, we were told by the high tea section that we are not allowed to dine there because we are a family. And the manager was exceptionally rude to my husband, calling out to him ""Hey, boss."" as though the manager had no proper training in greeting their guests. And why as a family, we can't have high tea there? We didn't say we want to sit together. Worse still, we have made a reservation!
My room had a good view, was clean. But there was no table for having tea, nor a long mirror to check for my dressing.... This should be basic.",1.0,The Fullerton Hotel,2021,Singapore,,Disappointing stay at Fullerton,Family

We chose 2 sets, one for each of us. the staff then offered us to choose a 3rd set. We thought since it's complimentary, why not try another one. However, at check out, we were informed that we need to pay for the extra set of breakfast. It was totally unexpected as we didn't want to order a 3rd set at first but were offered to do so without being informed about the additional charges. We paid for the third set anyway and shared what happened with the counter staff.

"1) There is a red stain on the couch in the room but overall clean.
2)there wasnt any comb and we had to request for it. 
3) I feel there should be a more transparent way of booking the facilities as people may have taken advantage of it. Called the reception and was told it was fully booked but when I went to take a look, there was not a single person using it. I feel it is good to have staff at swimming pool area to clear out unused towels else they could help allocate space for people. Also went to the pool at around 7pm and there were a lot of crows flying by to take a sip of water from the pool.
4) room was not really very sound proof as we could hear the bass of speakers from other rooms. 
5) Most disappointing was the ala carte buffet breakfast. I feel that the quantity could be in smaller portion so guests are able to really enjoy the buffet spread. Ordered laksa with a huge portion but comes with only a single prawn for the price of the buffet, it seemed a little ridiculous.

"The hotel room we stayed in 723 was very dated and in real need of a major update.
1. Furniture is old and worn out.
2. The bath tub failed to keep water in the tub because the plug to hold the water in even when pressed fully down still allowed water to escape.
3. Coffee cups/ curtain were very dirty.
4. Balcony door looked like a very old garden door. Even to the point where when I put my foot on it to step outside a part of it chipped off. Paint was falling off and both double doors looked worn out.
5. USB port next to the desk was not working.
6. The carpet felt and looked very old. Probably has not been changed in a good couple of years.
Overall I believe that this hotel relies on its history, location and exterior presence to draw people in however not concentrating on the hotel room and leaving them for dead is not the way. In order to bring in more millenniums like myself you guys needs to change the style and design of the rooms. Stop living in the 1990s and create a more simple, clean and modern design to the decor.

Had to wait almost an hour for the baby cot and bathtub which I already requested in the booking beforehand and it was confirmed by their staff via booking.com chat. The plate and knife i requested also took super long to come as well.
Check-out was the worst experience. The manager had to tell the counter staff to open more counters when I was in the queue to check out at 12pm (normal check -out time) and the staff hurriedly went behind the counters and wore their blazers. Then the manager proceeded to ask me if I was checking out. After I answered ""yes"", he took the key cards and dropped them into the express check-out box and went to the counters to instruct his staff. I did not even finish talking. He did not even ask if there was anything else I need or just say ""thank you for staying with us"". My husband had to go over to him to tell him that we were not done talking.

"Room - we didn't appreciate the steps in the room which we had to go up and down numerous times. My friend slipped and nearly fell down the steps. They caused inconvenience with no benefit. 
Window in room - the frames were perfect to view the exceptional view outside, but both window panes were dirty and obstructed the view. It was a real let-down, considering the perfect facing of our room. 
Pillow - were too soft for me though alright for my friend. Would be better if there's an offer/ note in the room to allow us to request for different pillow. 
Musky smell in room - when we entered the room the first time, there was a stench of musky smell. It lasted till night, even after a kind staff came to spray some air refresher.",4.0,The Fullerton Hotel,2020,Singapore,Heritage Room,Very Good,Group

"Top notch service by all the staff, especially for Singapore standards.  Probably the best I have come across having stayed in multiple 5* hotels in SG (e.g. Shangri-La Orchard, MBS etc).  Cheers to Cally who was on night shift and very kind in attending to my 2am room mishap.  Zabid from the front office for making every effort to take care of our family's needs, and Isabelle from the Club lounge.
Food and drinks (wine / Singapore Sling) at the Club Lounge was excellent.
Club lounge feels much more premium than the one at MBS which is quite a circus (crowded and can be noisy).  Ritz caters to more professional business guests, and the ratio of staff / tables to club lounge members make the experience feel much more premium than the Level 55 club lounge at MBS.
View and privacy is definitely better than the Valley Wing experience at Shangri-La which is on the 1st floor next to the reception and can be rather distracting with people walking past.
Rooms are immaculately maintained (for the age of property), and very beautiful - especially those facing the marina bay.
If you have kids, remember to ask them to do the Ritz Kids experience which was a nice touch to reward my daughter for completing the quest with a nice scoop of ice cream from Colony restaurant.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,2022,Singapore,Club Deluxe Kallang Room with Kallang Precinct view,Exceptional,Family

"First-time visit to Singapore for a 25th wedding anniversary, and so glad we picked this hotel. We had the chance of visiting many places and if you want a room with a view, this is the best place to stay. But besides that, the hotel  and the staff deserves credit for all the other things that made the stay perfect. Simply one of the most attentive staff teams that I have seen while traveling through 68 different countries. It's hard to rate the price/quality of this place because once the quality goes this high, you can wonder how you put a price tag on it. One suggestion for anyone looking for a relaxed stay in this place...add the lounge option to your room reservation.  Excellent breakfast, excellent afternoon/evening snacks (actually food!) and really nice service.

"The service at the hotel was great and attentive; I had a wonderful welcome gift from the hotel. However, at the price of almost $1000 dollars a night that should be pretty standard. The pool was wonderful to experience and it is great that there was no time limit. It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships. For me it was a must do for the pool but I don't think I would spend the money again since there wasn't much else to justify the high price tag. Great cleaning staff and front reception.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great service and the infinity pool was worth it!,
"Marina Bay Sands is a MUST STAY! Not only is the room cozy, the hotel is smack dab in the center of everything. Everything was in walking distance or a short uber ride. The light shows, the mall & the never ending choice of  foods is the reason we will definitely be back! Also thank you for our front desk check in person, Jia Qi, you were so helpful in setting us up for an incredible stay. We appreciate everything!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Must Stay!!,
"Stayed at MBS for the first time and was disappointed at the long checkin lines, crowded infinity pool, and overall retail atmosphere of the hotel. All restaurants were overbooked and reservations had to be made months in advance. After spending more than $1000 on integrated resort purchases we were told that our loyalty points would expire in 12 months with no option to redeem destination dollars online. Our Prestige status would also be downgraded if we did not continue to spend. This is not how you treat loyal customers! As a tourist, this discourages me from returning to MBS. Very commercialized hotel with poor concern for customers. We also stayed at the Shangri-La during our trip for less than half the price of MBS and the atmosphere was much more refined.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Welcome to Disneyland Mall,
"This was our second visit and was really hoping for a better experience but it was soulless, cold natured, boring and absolutely no vibe.

All the gear no idea.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Short stay,

The continental buffet breakfast offers a wide selection of different cuisines with local tropical fruits and juices.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Birthday Celebration,

Service for check-in was quick. You will need to register before checking in so that you won't have to wait long. Sms will be sent informing you of your Queue number.   We stayed at L51 at Tower 3 with City View. The room is huge with two big tv screens. The view is awesome. In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Awesome View,
"The infinity pool is awesome. I recommend the first time to visit the pool at dark, it is just amazing. At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition. The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen. Small travel hack in the in-house casino you get drinks, cigarettes and more for free.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Marina Bay Sands,

"We stayed a night in a garden view deluxe room and found it amazing. This is not a hotel, it is a resort with more than 2500 rooms. Still, check in was rather effektive. (They use a lot of time everywhere in Singapore). Rooms were great with good amenties and great views of the gardens and the supertree grove. We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests. Why??? Still - it was an amazing experience and is highly recommended :)",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Massive and iconic,
"Great experience, beautiful restaurants. Was greatly impressed by MOE whom I met at the infinity pool.

"I had a set price on my booking, but when I arrive they charged an additional 250> SGD on top of the additional taxes. Just be careful of this scam towards foreigners. Total for the room went from 650 to 950. As much as I explained- they didn't budge, it was 10pm and we just stayed and then left. Bad experience overall for an overpriced room.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Careful of additional costs!,
"We were fortunate enough to have a few nights in Singapore at the magestic Marina Bay Sands hotel.  The highlight for us was definitely Moe the lifeguard at the incredible infinity pool.

He even took some wonderful photos of our family (very rare to have all of us in the picture) and gave some great tips on things to do to enjoy all that this amazing hotel offers.

Two enormous bedrooms, massage room, gym, hair salon area, dining room, two fabulous bathrooms with jacuzzi baths - Hermes bath products and so it goes on. The beds were extremely comfortable and the view incomparable.  If I could 7 stars, I would! The staff were a delight, dinner in Lavo delicious.  We cannot thank you enough for such a memorable visit  Beyond every expectation.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Beyond my wildest dreams,

He is definitely a valuable asset to MBS. Keep up the good work Ryan!. Thumbs up!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,GEMS service from Ryan @ the pool,

"My partner and i stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights during June 2022. We stayed in Deluxe Room with a sky view located on the 45th floor. Our room was generous in size,  was equipped with all of the facilities you require and the view was absolutely amazing, in my opinion well worth the extra money when compared to a lower floor view. The hotel's infinitely pool provides breathtaking entertainment to everybody, regardless of their age. The hotel is connected to a shopping centre that offers a casino, high end shopping and an endless amount of food options. Marina Bay Sands is highly recommended!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,THE HYPE IS REAL,

Would give more than 5* if I could! The location is also very good for shopping, bars and restaurants and universal!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Best hotel ever!!!!,
"The hotel is huge and connected to a mall. The best part of the hotel is its infinity pool on the 57th floor, the view is just breath taking. We took the city side rooms and it was a great view from the room. The room size is also good for the price you pay. This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card. Kids felt special when they got their own key cards. the sofa cum bed dint have the best comfort, but was ok. they should have provided with a little more thicker beds. We would feel the springs in the sofa cum beds. The main beds were very comfortable. No complains there.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,View from the rooms is to die for.,

"One of the reasons we did a stop over in Singapore was to stay at this hotel. Yes, its almost $500 a night. They were very outgoing- allowed us to check in early at 930am- which is virtually unheard of anywhere. They also upgraded us to a king bed high floor with views of the gardens. Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool. Food super pricey as expected. 3 mini sliders and 2 drinks at the pool for $70 USD. Highly recommend 1 night stay for the experience. Free water and soft drinks in the room fridge is a nice touch.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Just have to do it once- top of the line!,
"Stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in Singapore over the years. The MBS has clearly a great view! Impressive!  Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good.  The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures.  Rooms are good but a bit dated. Gym is great, good views, and friendly staff.  I wouldn't want to stay there and rather pick other places.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Great view, but train station feeling",
"We booked a Deluxe King Sky View Room on the 44th floor. It was a very spacious room with an amazing view. The team was nice enough to provide us with an early check-in. The service was pretty quick as our luggage had reached the room before us and the extra bed was placed within 5 minutes of that.   The pool is obviously amazing at any point of time and they have amazing hot tubs as well. The drinks in the pool are not that costly. Sling or pina colada costs SGD 25-26 (inclusive of taxes).   I would suggest anyone who is visiting Singapore to stay on this hotel for at least one night and enjoy the property, be it the room, pool, casino or mall.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Luxurious property,

He also knows every good spot to take those pictures at, so don't worry about ideas of places to take photos! Moe was also very helpful and happy to assist all the time with a huge smile plastered on his face.

It is very far.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,An excellent service!,
"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands more than halve a dozen occasions but have never considered the rooms to be anything to shout about. The only one big reason you want to stay in the MBS is the following. The Garden Seaview or the Marina Bay Seaview. Other than that the rooms depending on the tower you are in are just normal, interior nothing to go GOOGOO about. The other only reason is the ICONI reason to take a pic at the infinity pool and dine at Spagos....ooops and not forgetting if you love gamblings and dorning the MBS Bath Robe and walking all over the shopping mall. With that being said, the few restaurants that are found around the MBS including their very own hotel coffee shop serves some pretty delicious food.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Awesome View,

Upon check-in, we waited for about 30mins for the extra bed to be assigned to our room (we booked for 3 adults). Housekeeping was prompt in doing their cleaning services, but the room service took some time for any request to be sent over. We understood it could be a peak period during that time. The TV  network was intermittent, as it kept on hanging. We would like to suggest the hotel to have some Malayscian good channels.  Toilet does not have a toilet spray bidet.

Marina Bay Sands is one of the best hotels in the world. But it was not the best for us. The staff at the reception were not so cooperative. They did not give us any room upgrade. Nor they did anything special for us. We had requested them to make our stay special by decorating the room or by doing something special (like sending a cake for us or a bottle of wine) but they did not do anything of that kind. Rooms were good. Food was good. We had stayed in this hotel in Feb 2019 but we still miss the infinity pool. The best part of the hotel was the infinity pool. The view was breath taking. Rest everything was very okay & not upto the mark. The lift of the Hotel was not good. We have better lifts in our commercial towers here in India. ,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Honeymoon ,

Had a 2 night stay this week and despite all the extra precautions introduced because of COVID the service was exceptional. We were lucky enough to be upgraded and had a one bedroom suite on the city side on the 53rd floor!  There are restrictions on the use of the rooftop pool with the need to book a one hour time slot.

Everyone knows it's a 5-star hotel and the reality is it is indeed one, in terms of the impeccable service and facilities. Everything is top notch. The room is awesome and is not just the view. Fantastic in-room amenities and toiletries. The only issue is the TV remote control, due to overuse, is worn off and the buttons (the channel changer) may not always work. Other than that, the gym is superb, the infinity pool exotic and the valet parking is very convenient. RISE restaurant is also a fantastic place for dinner. Overall a great stay!!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Impeccable,

The Club 55 upgrade comes with exclusive priviledges and complimentary  amenities including breakfast,afternoon tea and evening beverages and canapes for two persons. The lunch menu was not much to write about. The dinner menu was more substantive. If you enjoy alcoholic drinks in a good setting,you will enjoy Club 55. Club 55 is the main venu for the lunch and dinner treats. If the place is full when you arrive,there are alternative venues to enjoy same food.The view on Level 55 is fantastic.

Front desk Nicolette and manager kenny are super unprofessional and unhelpful. Booked 2 rooms for 4 person. Was denied connecting room as we were friends. Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room. Such a fruatrating and diaappointed staycation. ",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Terrible ,
" Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids had a thoroughly enjoyable staycation at Marina Bays Sands. Our room on Level 29 had a good city view. Looking out from our window,Apple stand was on the left and the Artmuseum was on the right. The whole complex was very crowded. Who says we are living in covid 19 restrictions?Car parking was a bit of a hazzle. So was the q for hotel check in.The restaurants were busy most meal times. Access to the infinity pool was difficult as guests were limited to one hour session per day.The Skypark observation deck on Level 57 is a must go at MBS. All in all,too much to do and to enjoy in the 2night 3 day stay.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Hard to beat MBS staycation during pandemic,
"Booked a room to celebrate my friend's birthday. I wrote in early to request for their help in planning for a surprise party and was amazed by their promptness in replying and in doing their best to accommodate to all my requests. I was impressed that the concierge staff even knows who I was and what I needed when I simply told him my name. He explained that all concierge staff had been briefed and they were supposed to remember such details.   Needless to say, the room was pristine clean, the best I have stayed in Singapore, and the view from the room was just breathtaking.

"I book Premier twin city view room at this hotel for 3 adults +1 children (6 months old) for our family Christmas staycation. Such excitement was crush within a day when the hotel confirmation give a call that this room could not be occupied by 3 adults + 1 Child as we requested. I could only accommodate either 3 adults or 2 adults+2 children. Through so much debate I know I would not win it since it's hotel policy which is ridiculous, how much space does 6 months old child need?! The hotel management need to review their room policy again!",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great hotel with bad policy,
"Was staying in mbs after phase 2 implemented. visited skypark swimming pool at night and in morning to take sunset and sunrise photo. Pool was by appointment but worth the effort as it was no longer crowded. Room comes with balcony, with nice view of garden by the bay, though the balcony needs some cleaning, could be due to covid19.  Restaurants just below my room and mrt within walking distance.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,3 night stay in deluxe room with balcony,
"Firstly, it may be a one time thing. We got the room with noisy fridge(i thought was aircon) which makes me (a light sleeper person) not able to sleep on the first night. After i gave them a feedback, they straightly change the fridge to the new one without noise. I was almost gave up my second night to just go back home as there is no point to do staycation without good sleep. Thankfully after they changed the fridge, everything was OK.  They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.  The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early. ",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Oops.. Not as good as i thought.. ,

The only thing a Chinese do not like is there is a big mirror facing the bed that we are sleeping and it is not a good sign.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Compliments,
"Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era.   However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained.   All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one. ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,November Staycay,
We first visited mbs at the time when it's open we remember how excited we were from the new consort.  Ten years after it's still home for some of the best places to dine in sg.

Some say this is the best hotel in the world! .......and it may very well be.   Now internationally famous world wide from the Crazy Rich Asians movie this hotel lives up to every bit of the hype that it has. Very impressive and state of the art with some of the most one of a kind features and views of Singapore.   Definitely hands down the best pool in the world on top of the hotel and only for hotel guests. Food here is the best! But if you want to save some money you can also walk down through the lobby onto the many options at the local malls and food courts which are too some of the best in the world as well! ,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Some say this is the best hotel in the world!,
I stayed at this iconic hotel in June 2019 with my husband and 3.5 years old daughter. The experience right from check-in to check-out has been just amazing. Needless  to say that the mall attached to the hotel is huge and has almost all luxury brands. the iconic infinity pool is just superb and one cannot explain in words the experience that it gives. The staff here was super helpful and did everything that we requested for in a very minimum time. Overall this place gave us a superb experience off Singapore.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,An experience in itself,

"The hotel room is huge with a spacious toilet and bath tub. We got a view facing the sea and it is an amazing view during the day and at night. The view from the infinity pool is also lovely.

Usage of infinity pool was cut to 1 hour per day and u have to book a slot in advance .   However, the above-mentioned did not stop us from enjoying our stay.

"Obviously the most iconic hotel of Singapore. So we had to stay here :-)  The first impression when you come in, for us, was that it's huge! The lobby is immense, large and high. The reception is a bit 'American' with lines waiting to check in, but they are quite efficient. And very commercial, so they sold us an upgrade, which we really loved in the end.  The room was great. Spacious and super view of the Bay and Singapore skyline.  The famous pool is lovely to be at. It's not really a pool, in the sense that it's only about 80cm deep, so forget about swimming, but it serves very well to cool down and make super pictures. There is a great choice of restaurants in the hotel and if that's not enough, it's connected to the Mall where there are dozens more.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Iconic and living up to it.,

The Hotel gave me a very good impression from the Front Desk staff to the housekeeping job very well done. However waiting for a cab took me half an hour. I asked a Malay staff who stand outside I want a cab where should I wait? She used her finger pointed a taxi stand so I waited there. 25 mins gone not even one taxi came in and I approached her again should I call the taxi myself or should I still wait. Then the other guy stand together with her says- you want me to call for for you? I told him the service here was very bad tarnished the image of this hotel. I called the taxi by myself. I believed as such a good hotel when I asked at the beginning she should have offer. ,1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Staycation ,

Hope this review gets to the management. Thank you for ending my day well with the warm gesture!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Helpful valet staff with special compliments to Manivannan,
"Went on a weekend staycation. For a 5 star Hotel in Asia the hotel was pretty average.  Little things like room keys not working and check-in desks not open were annoying and not what I expected.  The iconic infinity pool had the best views in Singapore but its not designed for inclement weather. No sun umbrellas or rain covering so if it does rain,  EVERYTHING gets wet.  Worth staying only to cross off the bucket list. I won't be coming again. ",2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A little disappointed..i expected more,
"Great hotel. The highlight is definitely the infinity pool. Rooms are amazing, with nice views. Service was extremely professional.

Apart from these two points, everything else was perfect.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great experience but it felt too crowded ,

"So, I was in my room and I felt like taking a swim at the infinity pool located at the top of the building in marina bay sands and managed to enter in with my pass and as I was walking past 2 lifeguards, one of them screamed  ""oiiiiiiiiii"" out of nowhere and I was shocked and confused. It was pure rude of them, and I was affected throughout my whole journey because of this punk, I do not know his name but I do know he's a muslim. Please keep your staff disciplined before allowing them to come out to work in this industry, acting like hooligans, is simply downgrading your company reputation and image. I would not recommend anyone near the pool, or as a whole in marina bay sands! with those punks roaming around.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,The lifeguard at the pool section was rude,
"This hotel is an experience, not the most welcomed check in/out but this is because the entrance is throughout the shopping mall. Once you are in your room you will be amazed by the comfort and beautiful views. The infinity pool at the top is the main attraction (the pool is only available to hotel guest) and is just amazing, you can also find a couple of nice restaurants plus a cocktail bar (this available to non hotel guest).

We stayed there for 1 night only to attend an event so we didn't had much time to explore the whole hotel. Great location with superb facilities. You will be amazed how many guests this hotel can accommodate everyday. They have 2 front desk counters in each side of the wing. Accessible to their MTR also there's mall next to it with a lot of restaurant choices. We get to visit their casino as well. A must visit in Singapore so I suggest you should make it worth it.

The hotel is located right next to the metro stations where you can easily get around, the gardens by the bay is just across the street where they offer a daily light show which i highly recommend anyone to have a look.

The hotel wasn't full which was also a relief, I stayed in one of the top floors and was delighted by the huge room, amenities and spectacular view.  I thought staying there was worth the price tag, the pool is a must do.  I also greatly appreciated how easy it was to walk to Gardens by the Bay which was a great way to spend a day.  The view from the rooftop restaurant is amazing but candidly Ce la Vie disappointed in the food and drink category; simply not worth the outrageous price tag.  The staff at the hotel is wonderful.

However, this was not the case. The food tasted fresh and well prepared.

The twin room is spacious, making it really comfortable for my 2 big girls and me. The infinity pool was generally quite crowded be it day or night, but it's still worth going to enjoy a good view of the city.

The pool is worth staying the night as you can only use the pool when staying in the room.  We we were lucky to be upgraded to a room with a  better view which was good as I think the wow factor would of been lost on the lower floors. There is an element of  nit picking to this as it is a 5* hotel which I think is mainly based on its pool an view. The room are a very good size and bath room is really good.  For the rooms to be better they would need coffee machines in the room not instant and a kettle. Just a few luxuries missing for the price tag. But still had a very pleasant stay. Breakfast was average,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing hotel but maybe needs a little more luxury for price,
"Recently, stayed at tower 3 of the hotel.  Stay was fantastic but the response for reported lost and found is slow. They were polite and everything.

I am not pointing fingers at any party. But it is indeed painful.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Missing Stash of Money ,

The rooms we had was really big and spacious. It had a great view overlooking gardens by the bay and my young son really enjoys the view.   The mall itself has alot of high end goods but to us is not the best place to shop. Also, there are not alot of local fares within walking distance of the hotel, so if you want to have a more 'Singaporean' experience, this is not the hotel for you.   The only gripe i have is that check out time is strictly 11am. If they can make it to 12pm, i think it will enhance the overall experience and give us more time to enjoy the facilities better",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Big rooms with fantastic views,

We didn't book a time slot but had tickets valid for the whole day as we were visiting Singapore from a cruise ship and weren't sure what time we would be able to get there. When we arrived it wasn't busy so we were able to go up straight away. We hadn't realised the Skydeck was quite a small area at one end of the top of the building, but still enjoyed our visit nonetheless. We had the most wonderful views over Singapore and the surrounding areas. There is a small cafe on the Skydeck so we had a coffee each which were quite reasonably priced.

Whilst the pool was always quite busy it wasn't as hectic as I expected it to be and we always managed to find sunbeds and had enough space to enjoy the pool and the views from it.  There is a fantastic selection of restaurants.  We had a lovely dinner at Adrift and really enjoyed our breakfast at Rise.  Overall, a nice place to spend a couple of nights even if it is just to try out the infinity pool!",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Nice hotel but a bit crazy!,
I have to say I expected much more given the price paid. I've stayed at much nicer hotels for much less cost. There was always a wait at the lobby and for the elevator which was uncomfortably crowded. There was limited pool access while we were there and I didn't find the rooms to be above and beyond what one would expect for a decent hotel. I understand the hotel is busy and popular and some of this may be out of the hotels hands but what really made my stay disappointing was the way we were treated by management. We felt unwelcome and I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. It feels poorly managed and they are relying on their prestige rather than continuing to improve. The front end staff was welcoming and friendly though.,2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Disappointed and Upset,
"They lost me with the over-crowding. If you are after more exclusivity this is not the hotel for you. Nice to have a drink on the rooftop. Sensation scenery! Amazing pool area but again, too over-crowded!",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Too crowded but nice!,
"Huge and very busy hotel but rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Magnet for tourists so you don't go anywhere fast on the ground floor! The gym is OK and despite being comparatively small for such a large hotel, never seems to be crowded. The infinity pool is spectacular and whilst I'm not a huge fan of all the beds being next to each other in a long line you can forgive that with magnificent views, all pretty cool. Food delivered to your bed is very good too, as are the cocktails and fairly reasonably priced given the situation!!",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Magnificent view from the infinity pool,
"Fabulous place. Clean, beautiful, big rooms, great beds, gobsmacking view, outstanding services.  Pool is fantastic but victim of it's popularity. Can be crowded at once. Recommand to visit the pool before 3pm and in week. Week end afternoon is very crowdy.  ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Fantastic experience,
"We stayed for Chinese new year. Light show is great and we watched the fireworks from the infinity pool. Room was average. Tea or coffee was only enough for one cup each.No milk just creamer and hardly enough. The robes were a ladies size 14 at best. No good for men at all.For $1000 for one night was an over rated rip off. We were given a double room when we had paid for 3 people. They had to bring in a roll away bed. Which reduced the floor space,A non smoking hotel but the people below us were smoking on the balcony, Plenty of other places to stay at that are much nicer, Save your money",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,OVER RATED,

The location is priceless, you have the gardens, shopping center, tourist attractions everything walking distance, enjoyed so much!   The infinity Pool was the best part, makes it all worth it!  I definitely would recommend to friends and family :) ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Infinity Pool makes it all worth it ! ,

"Have stayed here a few times over the years and have always enjoyed coming to MBS. However, during my most recent stay on 8th Feb, I noticed that the quality of the bed had been rather poor, causing me to experience severe back ache since the stay.

Booked the Premier Room with Harbour View and we were located on the 41st floor. Room is nicely design with mirrors all around the room. Bathrobes were available for use. Room had a mini balcony overlooking the Garden by the Bay. Able to view the Serene Garden with no obstruction. Bathtub is available in the toilet too. Visited the Club 55 and in house guest had a 15% discount off the bill. Infinity pool is not to be missed. Recommended to go early in the morning to catch the sunrise and swim with a view as it is less crowded. Shout out to Guest Service Edwin for the great insights around the hotel!,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Fantastic Stay,

"This hotel should be experienced at least once, the sheer volume of people is staggering! A huge busy busy complex, lots of energy and movement. The iconic pool is not to be missed - fun to swim around at the top of the world! The hotel staff was very attentive, we had a snafu that they more than compensated for. Plenty of places to eat with a great variety of cuisines. Not for someone wanting a relaxing experience - but great if you want around the clock entertainment. The water show is amazing as well.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A Little City,
"Stayed here three nights on a stopover and didn't regret spending so much money on a room here. There are many other lovely hotels to choose from so won't stay again, just because of the price, I was a solo traveller so the room charge did not offer value. You are paying for the service, the surroundings, the pool, the experience. I really enjoyed myself and had a lovely room on 9th floor, very comfortable and could not fault anything at all. The hotel is really a resort and it can be overwhelming when you arrive, three receptions, so many lifts and not all go to the floor you want. So allow a bit of time and patience to find your way around this complex. Shops, casino, bars, restaurants, spa it has everything so you don't need to venture out. I had a wonderful stay.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Everything you expected,

"Was so excited to stay at the hotel.  But the service and food are horrible. Took us more than 1 hour to check in, even though i did it prior to speed up the process lol.  ok, at the check in counter, they asked for the passport details even though at the online check in i already provided everything. So i guess their system is not interconnected between departments at all.  Service by the pool is horrible. Unfortunately, you can  feel racism. They would serve first Asians, then others. Even if you were first.  On a positive note, great views and clean rooms.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Don't stay there,
"Rooms in this integrated resort are basic and very much like what you can get in a business hotel, so nothing to rave about unless you get one with a good view of the Gardens by the Bay.  The view from their SkyPark and famous infinity pool on Level 57 is on the other hand everything to go for as part of the perks as a guest.  Other than its perfect location to explore the sights in the area and direct connection to the train station, this is also the only place to stay where one can have easy access to the most number of award-winning restaurants on site. With the casino, museum, theatre, clubs and most shops which open till late, guests will not run out of things to do during their stay.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,For their famous pool and much more,

"My stay at Marina Bay was so perfect. I wish I stayed longer here. The price per night is expensive but I think this is worth it, the property is immaculate and impressive.

"Yes, it is expensive but worth it. Fantastic room with views over Singapore. The roof top infinity pool is a must, we were lucky to be able to check in early so went up straight away, there was a shortage of sunbeds from 15.00 onwards. The towels are to die for, so big soft and warm and you are not restricted to 1 per person. Great adults only area of the pool strictly enforced by the lifeguards!

After a very sweaty morning, the infinity pool felt soo good.  The area was pretty full but it wasn't the madhouse I was expecting, we found seats right away.  the drink service was fairly timely considering the volume.  If you stay on floors 34 or lower, you will have to transfer elevators at the 34th floor.   Room was very nice but not over the top, very nice bathroom!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Worth it!,

After a trip on Clark Quay and a wander through the very expensive shopping mall we reached the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

"We stayed in a nearby hotel, but visited the foyer and the bar on the top to experience the atmosphere. Building itself is so eye-catching and fabulous to look at...especially if you've seen the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"". We booked a table at the top bar adjacent to the restaurant. If you come just before dusk, you'll be able to enjoy the earlier light show in Gardens by the Bay when the Super-trees light up.

"We had a night stay over in MBS and it was a lovely stay. Staff was polite and helpful. The hotel has rooftop bar, restaurant and infinity swimming pool so worth visiting and staying over.   It's very close to Gardens by the bay and you can see the night light show from the roof top. We were allowed late checkout.   Hotel is expensive but it's worth a visit!   If you are vegetarian, they have quite a few items in their restaurant menu..  Mind well..if you are off to the airport from the hotel...most of the taxi companies have a fixed price",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,MBS - one of the best,
"Fascinating hotel with pool on roof. Amenities in hotel and surroundings are excellent. Rooms large and breakfast expansive. However because of its size it lacks the ability to provide a personal touch. It welcomes, at a cost, the general public, which limits the guests options a little. Trying too hard to be everything to everybody. Pool on the roof is more a posing pool with 80% of those in the 1.2m deep pool having a mobile phone in hand taking selfies and getting in the way of swimmers limited though they are. Totally insufficient sun beds or chairs to accommodate all wishing to use the facility. Convenient location for Mall, Botanical gardens, and access to down town including Raffals. But overstretched. Overall expensive and not great value.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Vast Hotel,
"Marina Bay Sands is just beautiful. Roof top Sky Deck was just amazing as advertised. Attached to a large mall as well as the Gardens, lots of things to see and do. The Casino was also wonderful. I just found the hotel to have too many people from all walks of life, who were not guests, wandering around all the facilities, causing it to be extremely crowded, large tour groups, children crying, just not what I was looking for from such a high end property.  Imagine if you went to Las Vegas and there was only one hotel on the strip, and everyone who visits the city stops in there to look around. That's what it felt like.  I left and went to the Four Seasons. Aaaah!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Very nice.,
"Very big hotel with a huge swimming and spa area on the roof top. Busy place at all hours similar to a small shopping mall. Gardens are well lit up at night,  Free lazor show is good.

Was I totally surprised by the room and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore. The pool was okay only because it was so crowded.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Incredible Hotel Stay,
"We stayed in this hotel during the F1 race. It lives up to billing. The hotel is a huge complex, but that doesn't mean that the service and accommodations are not uniformly good. They are. Sure, the pool would get crowded (we went for in the mornings). But everything was top notch - from the views of Gardens by the Bay, the size of the rooms, room service, the food, check-in and access to public transportation. I would stay here again.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,An over the top experience,

"Famed for hospitality, Singapore was our best ever expectation. But staffs here at MBS ruined our stay. The welcome is friendly, but what would be necessary to reach the quality of service requested from a hotel and the prices charged (costly anyway) :  WELL TRAINED STAFFS A.

You have everything to make this place a magical place ...",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Train, not MTR but staffs",
"This is NOT where you want to stay. The hotel is full of tourists that probably have never stepped outside of their village before this.  It's crowded, hot (the air conditioning is always off).  The food here is so expensive and below average.  The buffet breakfast at Rise has good selection, but it's chaotic mess.  Servers are always running around and act like they can't hear you. The stations are always empty and you need to wait 10 minutes for items to be replenished. Worst part is the access to Gardens by the Bay.  One little elevator to cater to hundreds of guests.  The elevator has no A/C so it's like stepping into an oven with 10 other sweaty strangers.  10 years ago this place might have been cool, but it's clearly an aging relic that you will want to avoid at all cost.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Budget offering, 5 star pricing",

The room was spotless and benefited from a good sized balcony. Very friendly staff. Our deal included breakfast which gives a choice of three restaurants. Rise gives you the better breakfast but Spago has the views but also a queue. We stayed in a garden view room. Great views of the gardens by the bay. There is a very busy road in front of the hotel so sitting out on the balcony was noisy so if you want a garden view room go for a high floor. The hotel is attached to a luxurious shopping centre with expensive food options but there is a food court.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Stunning views and good service,

Welll Singapore is an expensive place and ofc here is expensive too. This is orginally a hotel but there is a mall downstairs. This mall is for only luxury shops.

In the room there were bath robes and slippers which you were allowed to wear up to the pool. A plentiful supply of bottled water was provided every day.

We stayed one night at  Marina Bay Sands on 30th November 2019.after our cruise.  We were given an early check in as our ship disembarkation was at 08.00 hours (the Cruise Terminal is only minutes away from MBS)  We were given a late next day check out free of charge by the MBS duty manager.  Due to an approx 5-6 hour delay with our luggage being delivered to our room after arrival (this worked out perfectly as we had an evening departure flight)  We had a beautiful room on the 13th floor with amazing night views of the city of Singapore.

The city view is spectacular with a lights and lazer show every evening 7pm and 8pm...beautiful.  The infinity pool on the 57th floor is incredible. Our room was really spacious.

"... but the price you'll pay is big, and we are not only talking about the money. For most guests, it seems that the rooftop pool is the mair reason to stay here. This results not only in a crowded terrace, let alone the pool, but also in a less-than-classy experience. Smell of french fries everywhere, fights for sunbeds and other small pleasures guaranteed.

Stayed two nights with my Mum and we enjoyed our stay. Hotel is very big and Staff do a good job. It was like being on a big cruise ship. Glad we experienced it. Lots of people everywhere. The afternoon tea was very good as was breakfast. ,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Massive hotel,
"My family loves staying here because it has an amazing infinity pool, is walking distance to attractions, and has easy to access MRT and taxis. It all facilities we need and the service is consistently very good. However, on our recent visit we noticed the rooms are starting to get a little shabby (for example a light switch got stuck 'on'). Also, when the weather is not great for swimming or when you would like the option to use hotel facilities (the pool and gym) for free after check-out /before a late flight - it is not the best option. In future we will carefully consider recent reviews and other hotel options before booking",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,The Disneyland of hotels,
"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights and had a fantastic time! Amazing views, food and service. Stayed on the 36th floor which had a balcony with an awesome view over the bay and the Garden. The room itself is decent - same with the bathroom, but the hotel room itself is not worthy of the price. But considering the iconic rooftop pool, restaurants and the first class service we got, we still would love to stay here again in the future!",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Beautiful and expensive,
the view from the room is awesome. the hotel is very well situated and has all facilities . the spa and the pool is a must to visit. the sea view is excellent and the restaurants are a treat.

We stayed 3 nights at The Marina Sands Hotel. The service from everyone we talked to was great. The room was beautiful and comfortable. We were on the 38th floor and loved the view of the gardens.

Room was good with a big bathroom, clean and the attendant was approachable. Check-in and check-out were smooth, even though crowded.

Positive: Luggage service is excellent!,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Nice hotel and amazing infinity pool,
Absolutely loved our stay at Marina Bay Sands. Infinity pool was a major attraction for me and I was not disappointed.  The customer service was great.  Our room was beautiful with view of nightly light show as well as view of the beautiful city. The restaurants were great on site as well. So much to do and see without leaving the hotel.   Easy commute to Little India and Chinatown via Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) conveniently located in the basement of the hotel. Must try Chili Crab while your there. Highly recommend Marina Bay Sands,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Fabulous Vacation,
"We weren't impressed with our stay here. The welcome at the front desk was abysmal, not even a 'Welcome to MBS, we hope you enjoy your stay' - more like 'Here's your key. Head that way'. The service during our stay just continued in the same vein, with no one being particularly helpful or friendly. You're just paying for the views and that rooftop pool access - which are spectacular, in fairness. But when we stay at a luxury 5 star hotel we expect service to match the pricetag. The room decor felt dated - beige and beige - and tired, with a stain on one of the pillows. We would not stay again or recommend it to friends and family.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Great views, terrible service",
What a magnificent hotel you find yourself constantly looking at it from all directions. It is attached to a shopping centre by an underground pass located next to the gardens by the bay and the art and science museum. Loads to do in the area. You can go to the top to get the views costs $25 which includes one cocktail but only worth it if clear sky as expensive but definitely an experience ,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Sightseeing,

"Stayed for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed. First time in Singapore and it is ideally located for the Gardens (walk across the bridge) and metro /underground and shopping.  Infinity pool is great fun. Can be busy from opening at 6am but with high turnover - few people seemed to stay all day so always beds available. Restaurants at peak times for breakfast were busy but Staff managed will and queue processed efficiently. Good large selection at breakfast. Booked limo service and were met at air bridge as you come off plane and escorted through (not fast lane) all the way to limo. Met at MBS front door (make sure you know which Tower) and did check-in in the room.Nice touch I've not had before (depends what room you book!). Huge,busy hotel with all the positives and negatives.

Air con does not work -- in a city on the equator.  :(   Staff have no idea how to do simple things like bill your room for your meal.

"I guess the draw card is the infinity pool, the atrium is pretty impressive too. But, frankly the rooms were bland functionality. I suggest you send your designers to Dubai for a week, they need an imagination implant. And the one thing that really annoyed me was there was no fridge.

Im not sure I would have stayed more than one night but it was a great place to hang out during my very short time in Singapore.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Worth the splurge for a night,
"MBS is of course one of the icons of Singapore. Everyone should do it once, just to experience the pool. That being said, its very expensive, in my opinion for what you get. almost S$500 a night. Check in took a while, but we were given temporary access to the pool while we waited for the room, which was nice since we just stayed one night. We got an upgrade to an upper room facing the gardens with a small balcony, which was nice to watch the gardens show without having to leave.

When we checked in we saw a lot of tourists. But thats what we expected cause Singapore is a stopover destination. Everything is big and modern and very clean but when we came in our room we were a little bit disappointed cause it just looks like a normal hotelroom... the service was friendly and of course the infinity pool great (buuuut very expensive when you want to drink something there). The shopping offer is amazing. Finally i would say it is worth to stay one or two nights there but not longer.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Nice and expensive ,
2nd time booking at MBS. We requested for a bigger room but was transferred to a smaller one.   We requested additional beddings & pillows and came immediately.

Some aspects of the decor could really use some attention, particularly in common hotel areas like lifts and hallways which clearly see a lot of traffic.

"The hotel was supposed to be one of the highlights of our stay. The swimming pool certainly is. The room was really spaceous and had a great view. But the promotion we got when booking the  room really is a disappointment, and i would rather call it a hoax. With the booking we were told that we could get a voucher up to 150 dollar to spend in shops and restaurants. Once in the hotel we tried to get it, but we were diverted to the casino, where we understood that we first have to earn the 150 by spending money in the shops...",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,The voucher offer is a hoax,
I booked a room on our way to Vietnam for my partners birthday present. Total opulence and snobbery at its best. The service is amazing as is the food. We were upgraded to a family suite and a complimentary birthday cake was delivered when I advised the special birthday occasion. The rooftop pool is excellent but it does get a bit crowded. Make sure you're well cashed up because everything is very expensive. However the inner greenie in me could not help but feel a pang of guilt when looking out from the rooftop with all the pollution and smog that by partaking and supporting I was adding to the pollution problem. Greta would be staring daggers at us too surely.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Expensive bragging rights but one for the bucket list,

"Hotel has two things going for it: great location and incredible pool. However, overall facilities are now slightly dated and worn and surcharges for F1 weekend are ridiculous.

"This place is a hotel and shopping place with a famous brand.  Besides having a place to eat, in this place there is a lot of entertainment.  One of them is Digital Light Canvas.

"Pricey? Yes. Too many people? Yes. A bit obsolete sometimes? Yes. Worth it? 120% YES!  The location, the view, the outrageous shape, the infamous infinity pool, the enormous casino, the sheer number of boutiques, restaurants, cafes, bars and nightclubs in the complex, and the museum and gardens, altogether make Marina Bay Sands a hotel at its own rank  No matter how much you hate all the Chinese tourists taking selfies in the pool or harvesting Gucci and Louis Vuitton like buying grocery, nothing stops MBS becoming an icon of Singapore and showing up on all postcards and magnetic sticks  Probably that's why there is the 'Crazy Rich Asians'  Welcome to the future",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A class of its own,
"This hotel is monstrously large, and has the most beautiful fun pool we have ever swam in.. 57 floors in the sky.  Rooms are great here but service is non-existent.

Walked a number of floors that we were allowed. Seemed like just another upmarket hotel once inside but very impressive building with walk overs from pillar to pillar.  Was too expensive to stop for a drink or food. Almost  twice the price of one of the larger chain hotels.,3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Nice piece of architecture,
"stayed 2 nights before going on a cruise through Asia, this hotel has that wow factor, swimming in the rooftop pool at 1030pm in 20 degrees heat cooling down with a beer or a cocktail, not cheap but rooms extremely comfatable and great views either other Singapore or the Gardens of the Bay.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,WOW factor,
"Marina Bay sands is great for a fabulous 2-3 night stay - much more than that is probably MORE than enough!  The experience of the rooftop pool is not to be missed, and the rooftop restaurants are quite the top notch feel.  The room was good - and we were sure to get a room on a top floor with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay!  We arrived in Singapore a few days prior and then moved to the MBS just for a few days - and it was more than enough.  I find this the equivalent to Las Vegas - lots of glitz and wow - but you only need a few days to have enough!  The bed was a little FIRM - but the accommodations were nice!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Marina Bay Sands Hotel - experience of a lifetime!,

A must do if you are in Singapore.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Incredible Hotel,
"We had returned fro Africa, so this was a beautiful and luxurious hotel. The service was great. It was spotless. Room was large and beds comfortable. View great. But.... the hotel itself is not very peaceful. The lobby is a frenzy of activity and gawking day visitors. Lines for check in and out are huge. The infinity pool was so packed not sure if anyone saw the edge. Every spare space was taken. There were children everywhere. Basically, it lacked a lot of style...",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Luxury, but...",

The room had the best views, the restaurants were excellent the rooftop bar and pool where just the best. It does get very full, but the best thing about staying overnight is that you can go up at night and enjoy a more peaceful and beautiful view! The staff and service were always welcoming and willing to help. I would definitely recommend.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,WOW!!!,
"The best in town and one of the best in world. We spent 3 nights here on B & B. This is world class and caters for all tastes. The views are fantastic and so much from entertainment to food available on within walking distance. The metro is cheap and easy to use for trips away. Staff are excellent. Real Thanks to Dziauddin Mahamud  the Concierge for all his help with a smile.  The real drawback is after a long flight the amount of time it takes to check in, it took us 30 mins wait just to get to the receptionist. Giving bottles of water whilst waiting in the queue was not good enough we needed  a quicker response. Please employ more check in staff. Otherwise an excellent hotel and really great staff but just not enough. This would be 5 star but for check in wait.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Hotel stay,

Was fun to visit with a great overall view of Singapore. The infinity pool is interesting. Did not stay at this hotel but enjoyed the observation deck. The observation deck has vendors selling food and drinks. It was very hot the day we visited so these vendors came in handy. The deck is worth the visit.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Sky park Observation Deck,
"It is a very large hotel and without doubt the only thing spectacular is the pool. It is very busy. Regarding the rest of the service, the rooms already look very old would need a renovation.

"Marina Bay Sands is the iconic architecture of Singapore.  Modern in every way - from the building materials, to the amazing rooftop park and pool, to the curtains in the rooms that open automatically upon entry.  This was our second stay and we had a small snafu at check in - we were early, our room was not  yet ready, and the hotel never emailed us as promised when it was ready.  It was disappointing but only a minor nuisance.  We received an e-survey to complete on the second day of our visit and when we mentioned the check-in issue the manager called us and went out of his way to make things right.  Altogether, another great stay.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Love It Here,

The pool is impressive, but quite crowded every time i went up there!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Very nice rooms and amenities. Pool always crowded!,
"The design of the building is impressive. We decided to book because it had Singapore's highest and largest infinity pool. Unfortunately, it is surely also the most crowded. It suffers from excessively loud music, too. There is no oasis of tranquility anywhere on the upper deck.  Otherwise, it was very much like any other four star hotel. Service what competent, polite and rules based. Queues were ubiquitous in August 2019 when we were there, even at the premium check facility. No turn down service. Toiletries not up to a five star standard, etc.   In short, not worth the USD/EUR/GBP 500 price we paid except for the experience of Asian tourism in 2019.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Upper end mass tourism hotel,
"We enjoyed staying at this hotel due to it's location. It's expensive but you're paying for the facilities and the infinity pool is incredible! We stayed in a Premier City View room which had a wonderful view. The room itself is ordinary and not on par with the price but it's spacious, has a comfortable bed and the bathroom is also spacious.  The staff were all friendly and helpful and immediately fixed an issue in the room. The hotel is a short walk to the MRT and shopping centre and the Gardens on the Bay are across the road. We really enjoyed our stay at this iconic hotel and would definitely recommend staying there. ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great location ,

I had a Garden View Room which was very spacious and enriched with all comforts such as minibar, hairdryer, slippers, bath products, bathrobes, iron, laudry service. The access to the pool os reserved only for guests of the hotel and the lunch I had at Spago was delicious. I also had dinner at Ce La vie restaurant on the roof of Tower 3.The view from uo there is incredible but the menu is not vary and prices are quite high... but the location is worth it. All the areas were very very clean and everything is kept under control.  This is just the Top!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Perfection,
"You do in fact get what you pay for! This is definitely one of the most expensive hotels but the experience cannot be touched. Everyone knows and talks about the pool, but until you are at the edge staring down at the city you cannot appreciate how incredible it truly is. The location, proximity to everything, the 4 times per night light shows and all the bars and restaurants make this place the only place to stay in Singapore. Could not have loved the stay any more. Also, if Aladdin is still playing at the theater when you go, spend whatever you need to to see it. Amazing show and a short walk over from MBS.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Wow, just WOW",

"This was a family trip to Singapore, combined with another hotel in the area.  The staff were generally friendly, and our room was also great, with a super-friendly butler and great views of the Gardens by the Bay.  Now to the cons: everything was really spaced out, so it took forever for us to go from our room to anywhere, be it the restaurant, the reception, or the pool. The pool was also  always extremely crowded (as was the mall and reception area) - and this was in February so I can't begin to imagine the chaos at peak times.  Bottom Line - Great staff, views and rooms but everything is far apart and crowded.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Enjoyable family experience,

I stayed MBS before when they just opened many years ago and I must say, the room is much older compared to the previous stay.  The area is nice, great for shopping and casino. Though shopping is more of the branded items. The room wise is pretty standard and you pay the price mostly for the location and the high end name hotel.

Expensive pero worth it naman. One of the most promising establishment up to date. I only stayed there for one night but let me tell you the experienced is great.

A little bit crowdy in the lobby but the day and night view really worth it at the rooftop Service at the pool and in the hotel is personnalized  and high level Amazing shoppes around and inside and you are near the gardens by the bay (our seesight from our room at the 29th floor) Maybe the non-access at the pool the day you check out (after 11am) unless you pay such a mid-day rate is frustating in comparison to other palaces,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Incredible view at the rooftop pool and amazing shopping,

You can spend a whole week in there without leaving the hotel and still be entertained. It is a must visit hotel for anyone, but it is not cheap to stay there. Also the hotel is in high demand and you must make a reservation to ensure you get a room . Kids loved it there. Must visit!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel with amazing view,
This is a great hotel with a fabulous infinity pool and great restaurants (both in the hotel and in the neighbouring shopping centre).  The room WiFi is good but the lobby area is very stressful because of the sheer number of people walking through - many on organised tours but not staying at the hotel - all day and most of the evening.  The WiFi in the lobby even for guests who have checked out is appalling.  I was at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for a conference.  It was a good conference but for a family stay I would prefer somewhere less fast and furious.  Still an iconic hotel though.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, stressful lobby",

Then, once in the pool, we discovered that we had to pay 50$ because my little brother wasn't allowed to enter. The room was really dirty and then we discovered that the breakfast wasn't even included and we had to pay 40$ each one. It's unacceptable and moreover, when we tried to speak to some manager, he was very unpolite and rude. Unacceptable! ",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Worst experience ever,
My partner really wanted to stay here so we decided on 2 nights which was plenty. People everywhere. Everything is extremely expensive.

There is not much shade though, but it does have an adult only side which was nice to escape all the kids.  It is expensive to eat and drink at the hotel.  My morning coffee was $7.  The subway is at the bottom of the hotel and it is cheap, clean and easy to take to other parts of the city.  Singapore is very hot, so dress for the heat. The gym is 24 hours a day and was great.  They also offer yoga by the pool a few times a week.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,amazing,

Despite being crowded, I found myself a great spot to lay by the infinity pool on the rooftop. I was on my feet for majority of my trip in Singapore, so getting a chance to relax, swim, and bask in the views was perfect.

Myself and my partner stayed here to celebrate my birthday in the club city view room. Afternoon tea was provided from 2-4 and complimentary drinks(including alcoholic beverages) and canopies from 5-7pm. Breakfast is also included. If you are staying for just one night you will not want to leave the hotel and eating dinner etc. may prove very expensive. I would highly recommend booking the club room although it is more expensive it is worth it for all perks that are included. The staff were all incredibly welcoming and I would return in a heartbeat. If you are staying in Singapore and your budget will allow you should certainly tick this hotel off your bucket list. ,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing ,

The pictures do not do this hotel justice. The sheer size and amazing design make this one of my very best hotels in the world. We had a harbor view room which provided not only the static view of the 'gardens by the bay' [absolutely amazing place to visit] but also the moving panorama of all the ships in the bay.. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was scarily impressive and a lot of fun as was the projecting deck out beyond the towers on the floor level.

My girlfriend and I decided to have a short stay in Singapore before heading to Malaysia. We made a booking in this incredible hotel because we thought it's a must to stay at least one night there and it was totally worth it. We had a luxury room at the 41st floor with a breathtaking view to the harbor site. The hotel and rooms are very clean and provide everything necessary. On the top of the hotel is the famous infinity pool with an even better view than from the room. There sometimes are a lot of people but there's enough space for everyone. The breakfast is a huge buffet with a lot of choice and high quality products.   We enjoyed our stay a lot and do highly recommend it!  People who say that staying in this hotel is to expensive literally have no idea.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Unforgettable!,
"apart from the design and the rooftop this is just like any other 5 star hotel. Maybe the rooftop pool access justifies the higher price? Maybe not? The rooms are fine, although nothing special. What I really did not like was the fact that even as guests of the hotel we had to spend a minimum of 1000 S$ in order to use the bars or restaurants on the rooftop. That's insane.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,its nice but too expensive,
More than just a view and worth the price. Not only excellent views but great service and friendly staff. Everything is modern and clean. Good gym with lots of space and again nice views. The infinity pool is worth the extra price. Rooms are spacious and staff was courteous enough to let us in to the rooms early.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Outstanding experience!,
"Definitely more like a tourist attraction more than a 5 star hotel. The family room we stayed at was one of the biggest rooms I have stayed at with my family of 4 but the second bed, a fold out couch, was more like a king single bed. The pool area and views are a highlight and must be experienced. Service was excellent but check in a little slow for such a big busy hotel. Overall still a great stay just think it is overpriced for the rooms.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Needs to be experience once,
Worth visiting this amazing structure while in Singapore. Take a lift to the top and have panoramic views of Singapore from very high up. Bar/restaurant at the top. Infinity pool up top but only for guests staying at the hotel.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great views,
"My experience during my stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was very disappointing! I will certainly not be staying here again! I get it- the infinity pool is inviting for instagram photos! However, it is ridiculously overcrowded!! Certainly not value for money! I paid over $1000 for my room and unfortunately my experience of this supposedly five-star hotel fell very short of expected standard for quality! Upon check-in at a non-busy period of 6am, it took staff over one whole hour due to continuous errors made on their part, overcharging my card!! Throughout the day, service was shocking: wi-fi consistently dropped out and orders were missed! Very disappointing!",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Let’s be clear- without the pool, this hotel would be a three-star not a five-star hotel!",
"Too brazen, too brash, too bold. Excellent facilities and amenities but soulless in service and atmosphere. The infamous pool is a human aquarium entirely devoted to the selfie. To pout or not to pout ...",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,All about the 'gram!,

"We stayed at both Marina Bay Sands and Fullerton Hotel on the same trip, and wish we had stayed at the Fullerton the entire time instead.    The MBS is nice if you like the Vegas type of experience. One night would've been enough for me, just to check it off the bucket list.  Like many other reviews said, the infinity pool was a zoo with everyone and their selfie sticks.    If you're looking for a true ""luxury"" experience with charm and quality service, I'd recommend staying at the Fullerton Hotel.  A side note on the coffee, MBS had those instant coffee packs (see photo) and a hot pot.  I don't need anything fancy like a Nespresso machine (which the Fullerton has), but having real coffee in the room would've been nice.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Overrated,
"After backpacking through Southeast Asia, I thought I'd indulge in a bit of luxury in the famous Marina Bay Sands. Booked a Grand Club Garden view on June 22, got upgraded to an Orchard Suite! The view was amazing, the facilities are clean and stylish. Also impressed with the service, considering there's 2500+ rooms here. Shout out to the concierge, who helped fixed my SIM card problems and the amazing staff at Club55, who made me feel like a king despite my obvious hangover. You guys have made such a great impression on me, that I will be back for another stay on November 9. See you then!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Excellent taste of luxury,

"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands did not disappoint! We had a city view room on the 45th floor. The room view is incredible. Walk in, insert your key, the window curtains open up to a fantastic view of the water and the city. The rooms are VERY spacious and extremely nice. All modern conveniences. USB plugs for charging, multiple light switches within easy reach, and all of the other expected amenities. They provide 4 bottles of water per room per day which was nice. The bathroom is great with a large, walk-in shower and plenty of great lighting. The pool is just as incredible as one would expect. Each guest needs to carry their key card with them at all times to have access to the elevators, pool, and observation deck. Definitely recommend.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Incredible hotel,
"This is a great hotel if you're in Singapore for tourism. It is very fancy, with all the amenities you could think of. Reasonably sized rooms. Great breakfast. Conveniently located.  However, don't count on sleeping here: The hotel is NOISY, mostly because it's right next to a major road. We slept at a low floor, but talking to other guests I know that the noise is a serious problem at the higher floors as well.   Call me old fashioned, but I believe the first priority of a hotel is a good night's sleep.",2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Fancy hotel, but not good if you're here for business",
"Only plus : Infrastructure, view , infinity pool . Rest everything : Strictly average Average room , no late check out requested, instead we were told if we check out even a minute after 11 then we still be charged for half day.  Vegetarians food at buffet breakfast is what we strictly disliked.  No taste at all, neither anyone asked us if we would need something else.  I would suggest Donot stay , just pay for the day trip there , that's enough. For the price we paid, we found nothing extraordinary",2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Average,

"Ce La Vi Lounge has the best view of Marina Bay Hotel both front and back!!! You can spend the same amount of money to go to the observation deck but no food and bev this is the better deal! It's $22 per person then the money goes toward your food bill. The menu is pricey but you are paying for that spectacular view. BJ was a very sweet and friendly server, he helped us with getting around the City!!! Thank you to BJ at Ce La Vi and I would recommend this place to others! There were many families with children, great for all ages!!! DON'T miss this restaurant during your stay in Singapore!!!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Most Beautiful View,

"We stayed a night at the MBS because the infinity pool was on my bucket list. It sure did not disappoint! Although there were quite a few other people enjoying the facilities as well, the pool did live up to the hype. As for the hotel itself, albeit MBS is not considered the best hotel in Singapore by locals, we thoroughly enjoyed our spacious, comfortable and clean room from which we could see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay. To be honest though, the main reasons to stay here are the pool, the view and the wow-factor, not the rooms. In any case, the staff was very accomodating. Had to manually reconnect to the wifi several times, which was annoying.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Worth it,
A laser show which is a must see at 2100 HRS from the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Arcade (entrance is from near the Marina Casino). It is a 15 minutes long show. Try to reach there by 2045 HRS and grab a seat. You can go early as well and do some window shopping / shopping as there are wonderful brands and showrooms there.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Laser Show - Shopping Complex - Not to be Missed,
This was the perfect start to our holiday. The hotel itself is spectacular and our room had a beautiful view of the bay and the sky park. The hotel has a lot to offer if you're looking for a relaxing break. The rooftop pool is an attraction in its own right and there are great restaurants and a shopping centre attached to the hotel. It's not exactly good value for money but it's great for a luxurious treat.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A memorable stay,
"POSITIVE The views and the location. The root-top pool.   NEGATIVE Too crowded, feels more like a shopping centre or an airport rather than a hotel. They should restrict most of the areas to guests only. If you pay a premium to stay in a luxury hotel, you expect there to be less people.  Too many restrictions, even for guests (can't use pool after check-out) The pool itself is very crowded, not very well looked-after, no clear separation from the kids area. It's a mess.  Beds are rock hard and not very comfortable Rooms are quite dated, not very modern Everything is super-expensive! $$$",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Overrated,
"If ever in Singapore, book Marina Bay at least for 1 night...you wont regret it.It might be a bit pricey but is worth every penny.

At the check-in my partner received a gift for his birthday at the Casino(nice touch) and we received a room with Gardens by the Bay View....OMG ,just OMG The view from our room was like a painting ,we were also able to see the lights in the Gardens from our window...incredible. The infinity  pool was not that crowded and we were able to take some nice pics at the sunset. Is definitely a must...when in Singapore.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"If ever in Singapore, book Marina Bay at least for 1 night...you wont regret it.",
"It might be a bit overpriced but it is also an experience. If you can afford it (even for a night) you should do it. At least because it gives you access to this massive Infinity Pool at the top which is also an experience to do once (even if it is very crowded even at 8.30AM) Room was great also, but I would have expected a little bit better for the price (like a real balcony).

"Arrived to the hotel early, at around 9:00, but was lucky to receive the keys anyways. However, we had to pay 100 SingaporeAn dollars for an extra bed, which was a hit overpriced. Got a room at floor 41. The room was nice; big and pretty clean. However, you have to be careful about accidentally using it taking something that costs money. When ordering food, be aware that things like ketchup costs extra money. (2 Singaporean dollars for 1 small cup!!) Learnt that from experience.

I had in-room breakfast that is quite delicious with a very on time service. It's useful to say that you pay only for the rooftop pool: this is only the reason why you should book only 1 night here in your lifetime.  I've tried all the restaurants and i can say that they are all fine, but nothing extreme excellent.

You will certainly not receive personal treatment like in other 5 stars hotels... Its Just to BIG, too crowded...   They do not accept maestro card... I had to go to an atm like 10 min walk from the hotel and withdraw a large amount of money... I was really annoyed...   ",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Check-list but.... ,
"before you die do this!  Our son stayed here a couple of years ago and we added it to our list.  We decided to go slightly mad and booked a club room.

We booked direct and had a beautiful room on the 45th floor.  Highly recommend a city view room - we always sat Garden side when we went up to the club lounge.  Staff were exceptional and very kind to us.  Lived up to our expectations and beyond.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Once in a lifetime experience,

Room service was quick and our room attendant made us delightful towel animals each day.  This is a HUGE hotel and I can see how people might feel like the personal service is missing. But we did not have any issues. Check in and check out were easy. The concierge was very helpful in booking transportation to Sentosa for us.

We were overwhelmed with the MBS generosity and just how fantastic the suite was- who has a grand piano in their room? Wow! The excitement we all felt walking into the suite will forever be a treasured memory. Then the curtain fell down, and they swiftly upgraded us again to another suite, even though it was almost impossible to imagine a better room, it was.

The view from the room is great, and the skydeck actually gives you almost the same view from the room, except   for the other side, the Gardens by the Bay which I couldn't see from my room. The infinity pool seemed too crowded with people who are worrying if they could get the perfect selfie or not. Check-in and check-out were done great, didn't have to wait long. One of the hosts on the skydeck wasn't too kind, i paid over 500 singapore dollar to stay 1 night in your hotel, be kind to your guests. Now i've seen it, i know it's all about the view.

The highlight for us though was the rooftop bar, the view from the top is incredible and the cocktail list was superb, I think we had one of everything on the menu by the end of the night. Glynn the bar manager went above and beyond, couldn't have done any more to make us feel welcome.

This is home to the iconic infinity pool that has a great view of Singapore Skyline and some even stay at this hotel just to use the infinity pool and take some cool snaps.

"Stayed one night at the Marina Bay Sands. It was a WOW experience from the moment we arrived. The personalised check-in, the very friendly and professional concierge and restaurant staff make you feel at home straight away. We had a wonderful room with balcony overlooking the gardens and were speechless when we noticed we had curtains opening and closing automatically. The infinity pool is absolutely amazing, the cocktails in the bar were excellent, the dinner selection in the buffet restaurant and the breakfast buffet were top. And in the evening you can run from one side of the hotel to the other to watch the light show in the gardens and the water and laser show in front and on the hotel facade. We enjoyed every single second of our stay.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Incredible experience,
"Have been to Singapore multiple times but always wanted to go to that pool. Spent 2 nights here in a club room, ridiculously expensive but it did include breakfast in Club55 and canapes in the evening so I didn't have to spend any money on food. My room was huge on L47 and had a fantastic view. The pool is spectacular but is very crowded and many people hog the chairs around it. I was able to have a swim and take the photo but didn't want to stay because of the crowds. The lobby was super busy and I found that a little disconcerting and impersonal. But once I got to my room, it was very peaceful. I'm glad I stayed here but not sure that I would again.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,That pool!,
"Marina Bay Sands totally is the best part of Singapore every beautiful part is in there . The hotel the science museum , garden by the bay .

The hotel luxurious but so many people normal I think .  ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,The Best of Singapore ,
It was my firstime to visit Singapore for a 3 days only. But I'd rather not to sleep and be on the streets walking around the beautiful city lights of #SG.Nextday still awake until i get my visa on the 3rd day. Singapore always has a clean environment that i could tell. From the local people to all there surrounding are such incredibly inseparable. Seeing Merlion and Marina Bay was a happy moment for me. I guess one day will be back again here. Sadly i just missed universal studio which is everyone's landmark. Well theres always a time for everything.   For all people wants to visit SG you will have fun. Not a big country but a very big heart and talented Singaporean local  people u met.  #youwillmissforever,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,When in #Singapore for the firstime ,

Arrived just after 1000 checked in, with Hill where she was great & we were able to get our room, excellent service .We had booked a sky view room & definitely were not disappointed the view was fantastic, especially at night when Singapore Bay comes to life. Spent the rest of the day at the pool, unbelievable views really amazing all staff very attentive.  All areas spotless & attention to detail is evident everywhere...",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing did not disappoint....,
"I went to this hotel again after a few years and they have not kept their standard. The room was so so dirty, the bathroom walls were covered with hair. The pool water was green. We checked out immediately and went to a different hotel.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,So Dirty,
"enjoyed the laser show. quite crowded on the promenade, could be a better view from top floor. they have two shoes at 8 and 9 pm . Hotel charges tourists a whopping fee per person for a short visit to skydesk. then theres the queue. it becomes quite an amount for a large family. instead a one day stay could be a better deal. as one can visit many places nearby and within the hotel at leisure. one has to walk a lot in Singapore. must plan for a weeks stay minimum to see few of the attractions and part of the city. Thogh the MRT & busses networks excellent one must have  budget for taxis as well. research well for food. very hot during the day so plan activities in morning, keep afternoon for rest and go out in evenings to return late",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Expensive as expected , a nice touch of laser show everyday evening",
"We stayed here just for one night so  we  could experience the infinity  pool , we knew in advance that is very expensive  for food and drinks so we  just budgeted for it, As for the hotel it is very impressive and we weren't disappointed  at all,  all the staff we interacted with were every friendly and attentive. We had a garden facing  room which had lovely views , room was Spacious  and clean,   As for the pool it wasn't as busy as i thought so we had no problems finding sun loungers and room for the selfies!!, they have bar staff coming round serving snacks and drinks ( yes expensive)  but as i said just accept  it and enjoy the experience , definitely recommend  this place !!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A Must do even for one night,
"I stayed here in November 2018 for 3 nights. Is it expensive?

"We celebrated our anniversary in this hotel and we have booked one night while we have another hotel for the rest of the days we have stayed in singapore, anyways the hotel is amazing, room is huge huge, facilities are perfect, cleanses is top. I advise to take city view since you will get amazing view from the big automated curtain of the huge windows in the room. I told my wife we could play football in the room as much as it is big. If you are in singapore, book one night go to swimming pool and skydeck, you are going to have alot of fun.

Stayed for 3 nights for my 50th Birthday-absolutely amazing room on the 31st floor looking over gardens by the bay. Beautiful room with great facilities. Can't fault anything. Special extras for my birthday made it extra special. Every staff member we came across were great and went out of their way to help. The infinity pool was amazing and not overcrowded. Ate at Spargo on the top floor which was awesome. Would definitely stay again,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Superb experience-worth every penny!,

I would like a pillow menu next time ad the pillow was not to my taste !",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Could not fault it!,
I have stayed at the Marina Bay twice before but this time was exceptional. It was my husbands 60th and we were there with a party of 9 people including family and friends of ages between 25 & 60. Most of the group would not have stayed here before or even visited Singapore. We had a fantastic experience thanks to Sherman who made our stay and my husbands 60th just perfect. Thank you Sherman it opened my eyes yet again just how special Singapore is and confirmed that Marina Bay is the best place to stay. Highly recommend. Date stayed was the 22 & 23fd of April 2019.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,60th for my husband with the family,
"This is an example of how a large hotel should work, it was perfect from check in to check out. The facilities are very good, the room very nice, the breakfast fantastic and of course the pool is incredible. It has a large shopping center connected, with connection to the metro just next to everything. Repeated? no doubt yes.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Diego Martin in Singapura,
"I visited the Marina Bay Sands hotel and visited the Sky Bar to see the views of Singapore. Top tip, if you pay to go to the observation floor you have to buy tickets and there are no benefits on that floor apart from amazing view. If you buy tickets for the Sky Bar which is in the 57th floor they give you vouchers to the same value as your tickets which you can spend at the bar, so in reality the view costs you nothing. Food and drink are available and the views are incredible. ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,What an incredible view,
"Had an amazing time here! We wanted to come and stay here for so long and we're so glad we finally did. Believe the hype, it is a spectacular hotel. There is a casino attached, the mall, and the public transport train is there too. Very central, and every staff there from check-in, bell boys, random staff all the way to check out have been extremely kind and helpful. The pool obviously is a must see, it is a very busy hotel, and you can easily get lost but it's amazing. I can't wait to come back again!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing Hotel! Worth a visit for sure.,
Yes it is not cheap but the service food and pool with great views is outstanding When we arrived 8pm got our room and went straight up to the pool you can have just a light snack or meal and drinks Our room was great with great views Breaksfast was first class at the rise would highly recomend staying here Staff are very helpfull,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Outstanding,
"I first visited the Sky Deck of the MBS in 2016 and knew then that the next visit to Singapore would be in this hotel. The club rooms are amazing and we'll worth the money, especially for the view. The club lounge on the other hand was good, but not as good as other 5* hotel we have stayed in. We had to register in a room tucked away in the corner of the building, which was smart and comfortable with hot and cold drinks at our disposal. Although we enjoyed our time at MBS and the pool was amazing, the thing I love about entering a 4* + hotel is their amazing lobby's with great artwork, plush furnishings and chandeliers. The MBS is like entering a huge shopping mall with a hotel on the upper floors...",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing night view over the city from the 39th Floor.....,
"It's a very expensive hotel for the tourists, and we decided to just stay 1 night there. Our room on the 32nd floor was a Garden View room, but it also had a nice view of the ocean.   My family went to the famous rooftop swimming pool during the afternoon and at nighttime. Both hours had simply magnificent views of the city and sea.I also tried out the rooftop bar later on. That place had a very nice vibe too--with a DJ and live musician indoor, and again some great views outside.  If you're willing to pay extra money while in Singapore, then I do recommend this place.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Was worth the money,
"Yes, maybe it hasn't the colonial atmosphere you would like in a hotel in Singapore. Yes, sometimes it looks like an aiport lounge. But when you arrive from the airport the first thing you see of the city is Marina Sands Bay and you will never forget this vision, NEVER! We arrived at 8am and checkin was so fast. Our room was not ready and we took a visit at Gardens by the Bay. Lunch at Satay by the bay (very good!), back to hotel at 2pm and lift to infinity pool (WOW!!!). Relaxed at the pool 'til 6pm then we visited Marina Sands shops and after dinner the light show of super trees from the Marina Bay Deck.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,The place to be if you are in Singapore,
Had to go and see this hotel and were allowed to go to the top to the bar to have drinks. We arrived at just after 10 and within seconds you are deposited at the top to be greeted by friendly staff and to this amazing view. Drinks are expensive but not much more than you would pay in any 5 start hotel and whilst charged $56 to go to the top it is given back to you with drinks.  What a fabulous few hours spent looking at the view and having cocktails and just very relaxing. Hotel looks great and just amazingly built. Huge recommendation to see if only for the view.We were not allowed into the pool area as we were not guests but saw lot's of people in gowns coming from the pool and they looked happy.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Great place,
"The Hotel is clearly a must when visiting Singapore. In my personal opinion, the hotel is like a Mall, with a lot of people, the check in process is not very fluent, even though we were offered water and Ice creams while waiting, still slow.  If you want to swim in the famous pool, you must stay in the hotel, besides that, the hotel is more an tourist attraction than a place to rest and enjoy the city. Is very well located, so you could probably visit Singapore and stay the whole place (Hotel, Pool, Mall, etc) so it is up to personal choices.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel with too many people,
"The hotel itself is stunning as the architecture is amazing! The roof top pool is a great experience and looking over the bay from the Skydeck is also great. However, due to it being so popular it does have a 'conveyer belt' feel to the stay. There are always masses of people checking in and out and pool itself gets very hectic. The rooms are very nice and well kept, but nothing exceptional.  It's definitely exciting to stay there and enjoy the facilities, but it's not a luxury hotel experience!",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Second stay at Marina Bay!,
"We stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Singapore. The hotel is everything you would expect and the staff and food were both absolutely excellent, but the pictures do not do the infinity pool justice. Its simply stunning, with views out over Marina Bay on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other. And, surprisingly its not crowded, there are lots of loungers available to watch the Singapore skyline from.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Simply stunning!,
"We had the best sleeping and waking moments with an awesome view of Gardens by the Bay. Service was superb. Our room was cleaned several times a day. The staff were all courteous, very attentive to all our requests and honest. I left ex gratia for the housekeeping every time but nobody took them so I enclosed them with a thank you note on our last day.  Don't miss cocktails by the pool during sunset. It's a bit crowded while we were there but the view was so amazing so we didn't mind having a lot of photobombers. It's absolutely on the pricey side but with the kind of service we've experienced, I wouldn't mind coming back.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,a-must staycation in SG,
"Even you can't afford to stay in this hotel, there are things you can do at low cost or no cost. The food court here is not as expensive as the restaurants in the hotel.  There are two light shows every night at the Garden by the Bay as well as another one in front of the Bay, both are free.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A place to spend a day for tourist,
This is a must stay for anyone who loves to travel. From the moment you walk in you are treated with royalty. I have no complaints at all about this place. I got a free upgrade too because it was my first time there.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Main attraction,
Stayed for layover night in a Premier City View Twin room. Very spacious. Twin bed too small to sleep with kids. Should be queen size for that. Pool was crowded as expected.  Positive atmosphere was caused by sunset and dawn light. Spago cocktails and sushi quite good but not special enough for the prices. Overall very impressive hotel if you are looking for crowded environment wherever you go.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Impressing hotel,
We recently stayed and it was a wonderful experience. From the moment we entered the foyer the service was second to none. We were ushered to a VIP space to check in and then offered a superb upgrade from level 4 to level 43 and of course we accepted. The fixtures of the hotel and our suite were fantastic. The staff are friendly and super attentive. So glad we got to stay here.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Exceptional,
"Wow. What a hotel. The architecture, rooms, views and staff are incredible. Didn't want to leave here.

this was my third visit to this hotel so as we had arrived around 2 pm in the afternoon and we had booked some higher category rooms we were in the ever waiting check in queue more in the front and were lucky that our rooms were ready as still some people were asked to wait as check in time is 3 pm and check out time is 11 am they really need a lot of time to get the rooms done > the lobby as usual crowded as if the rooms are for free and mind you this prices here are not cheap> now for the good things the rooms as usual good > the shopping mall and the casino it has all what else you need and to top it all the infinity pool just amazing loved it the service and the cocktails at the pool deck just amazing > one word Enjoyed my stay,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,a memorable family holiday,

I was lucky enough to spend nearly a week at the stunning Marina Bay Sands at a work conference.  It really didn't disappoint.  Of course you can't really swim in the infinity pool - its for taking selfies and watching the sunset!  And yes its absolutely huge but I found the service excellent and my room was beautiful. I had a view out on the bay and could lie in bed and happily watch the lights of the city.  Just magnificent.  There is a massive shopping centre below (some high street but mainly high end!) and lots of restaurant choices - my favourite was Lavo.  I would definitely splash out to spend another night in this gorgeous spot!!,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Whats not to love!!,
Worth visiting on any trip to Singapore. Accessible from any part of Singapore by Taxi Rooms are not only bigger in size but have fabalous view. Breakfast is excellent and includes  Indian Menu. Reception staff is courteous.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,AWESOME LOCATION,
"The world famous infinity pool is not to be missed.  The hotel is huge with top service. However because of its size and modern design it is more like a hub than a luxury hotel.   Other than that, the restaurants and service is second to none. Definitely worth at least a 1 night stay to experience the pool and stunning views.  Follow me on instagram for pics, videos and reviews @gentlemans_journeys",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A must if staying in Singapore,
"We are regular visitors to Singapore and always like the idea of staying at MBS to be able to use the pool. The pool did not disappoint- views are spectacular. We have been up to the rooftop bar on previous visits but it is so lovely being able to use the pool. Rooms are lovely and have all the needed amenities, however this is a corporate style hotel and therefore the rooms are quite basic in style. We had a harbour view over looking gardens by the bay. We loved staying and cocktails by the pool are great! They are pricy if you are used to uk prices however they are online with Singapore alcohol prices.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,A tick on the bucket list,
"We stayed 1 day at this hotel and I think this is enough because it is very expensive and not too luxury from inside. The club lounge was a little bit disappointing because the food was not as good as I expected and it was very crowded so that sometimes people had to wait outside the club until there will be places. Moreover, the queues for the registration to the hotel was very big (for those who take the lounge access they have another queue in another room which is great and fast). The big big big advantage of this hotel is the 57 floor - the pool. It is so amazing !!! So beautiful and the cocktails there were great! It is mandatory to be there!!! Overall, we liked the hotel and it was great to be there for 1 night.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel,
"Just spent three days at Marina Bay Sands, very big hotel with lots and lots of people, rooms are  quite spacious.Directions to places are not very well signed, we asked how to go to the gardens and they sent us over to the shopping centre. we ended up going through a construction site to go over to the park and gardens. Breakfast very expensive $100 for two people.we went over to the shopping centre and had dinner at The Nostra Cucina restaurant we had pizza and it was lovely, great service as well. We also had lunch at Firlino across the water lovely restaurant and food, the chef also told us how to cook the lamb we had.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Short holiday,

"Booked the executive package and no waiting around for check in. Yes it is large and lacks personality, however the service from the staff remains very good and of the highest standard.  No queues for elevators and yes the pool was busy in the afternoon so best avoided as lots of screaming children running around. We went for a swim at 2100 and again at 0600 and it was bliss, much quieter than the day and no problems finding a poolside lounger. Swimming 57 floors over the Singapore skyline is what this hotel is about, and we loved it.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Do it once, if only to swim in the pool in the evening and sunrise",
"The MBSs has 3 towers. It is a jaw dropping hotel. Its magnificent. We booked quite late for Dec 2018 and only managed to get a garden view room. Not a problem both views  are amazing. However, at check-in the lovely lady checking us in noticed from my date of birth that I was probably have a milestone holiday, which we were.  She checked us into the room booked and then said to give her a few minutes. She managed to give us as city facing room on a really upper floor. WOW..... The room was very large and clean. Amazing views, large bathroom with everything you would expect from such a hotel.  Swimming - WOW WOW WOW. Guest can use the infinity pool which the kids enjoyed to the max.

We went to our room, of which was spotless, lovely interior a lovely balcony. At 7:30pm we had a knock at the door, to my surprise a Birthday cake was delivered, as it's my Birthday this month. We then visited the infinity pool, located on the 57 floor, wow wow, what a experience, can view Singapore 180 degrees. We absolutley loved the hotel, . We also found a food court, where we could sample the local foods. I have been in the catering industry for over 19 years, and have never experienced such, passionate team of staff, it was a delight. I will be returning.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing Experience,
"Checking in again after 4 months , chose a garden view premier room. Got a 9th floor with great view. However need to change lift in order to get to the pool. As Low floor does not direct access to the pool. Compare to my previous stay at the city view room. Garden view room felt more warm due to the sun. But for smoker garden view room will be a better choice as you can smoke in the balcony. Overall experience still great.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Staycation ,

The restaurants in the hotel and the shopping complex are over-priced, so best to check out the many other choices in Singapore.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Impressive, but not for everyone!",
This is definitely NOT the cheapest hotel I've ever stayed in but it maybe the most spectacular one. It towers over the bay in Singapore and looks amazing. The infinity pool is without a doubt the best thing about this hotel and is worth a visit during the day and also at night. We stayed for a week and were still finding new areas to explore. There's also an MRT station (Bayfront) underneath the Marina Bay Shopping Mall which makes getting around the city really easy. Hopefully I'll be able to afford to go back someday. ,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Exceeds all expectations! ,
Believe the hype. Close to so many attractions and attached to the shopping mall and casino. Our room was large and comfortable with amazing views. When ordering room service breakfast please note that they give you huge portions enough for an army. The pool is worth the price and lives up to the hype. We were lucky and got to checkin early. Our bags made it quickly to our room and checkin was a breeze.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,What more can one say?,

"Although expensive, we would highly recommend that staying at MBS is worthwhile. We had two rooms for the 4 of us (children 11 and 14 years), on 35th floor, overlooking the city and Marina Bay. Huge and spacious. Excellent amenities. Stunning views, and had a beautiful view of the Spectra light show, from our rooms. Excellent location - within easy walking distance to Marina Bay, Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, and even Chinatown. A treat to swim in the rooftop pool (although VERY crowded and popular), and views in both directions (towards the city, and over the Gardens) were spectacular. The highlight of our 5 night stay was waking at 7am one morning and going for a peaceful, relatively cool walk through Gardens by the Bay and watching the sunrise.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Convenient location and highly recommend for a family holiday to Singapore 🇸🇬,
"First word that comes to mind? WOW! Marina Bay Sands is one of a kind in all aspects. Its such a unique structure in the lobby, its an instant icon. Checkin was even a great experience! Icecream upon arrival - how good is that! I tell you now, when you first enter the room its a OMG moment, i wont ruin it for you, but its pretty spectacular. Ultimately most people stay for 1 thing - that pool. Yup, the skypark pool is out of this world, and above it! Its a must do in Singapore. We splurged on poolside food and drinks for lunch and was a wonderful experience, we returned to the pool for sunset and it was a moment to savour. You HAVE to stay 1 night here in your life. The rooms are beautiful and well fitted out, luxurious. True 5 star.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Put this on your bucket list - its a must! Worth it just for the pool,
"We first stayed at Marina Bay Sands not Long after it opened and to be honest although it was/is an amazing hotel the service let it down.

We were disappointed to leave today ! One of the best stays in a hotel we have had !",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing Second stay.,
"although this Hotel isn't rated the best in Singapore, it is for me. I've been visiting Singapore for over 15 years on numerous occasions and in all the Hotels I've stayed in, this is by far the best. You can feel the luxury and beauty of this Hotel from the first time you see it. The rooms are spacious and I selected a view of Gardens on the Bay. What a stunning view but not as stunning as the night view you get when you swim in the worlds highest infinity pool, 57 Floors up. You have to see it to believe it. I could have stayed there looking at the view all night. Service is beyond reproach and it's run like a well oiled machine.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Best Hotel in Singapore,
There is very little you can fault. The infinity pool is a must see. The food offering is very good. Breakfasts were excellent. And yet for me it was just slightly missing the atmosphere and service one usually expects in a 5 Star hotel. Everything is huge and fantastic. Personally the sheer size means the service not quite up there with say a Shangri-La or Conrad. Worth experiencing though given possibly best location.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Experience once...,

"This isn't a infinity pool! This is just a rooftop Jacuzzi near to the edge.  I have no problem with the room. It's good. Besides how cheapskate they wanted to ask for charges (or deposit, I forgot) for the bar fridge. Hello your hotel room isn't cheap okay.  The worst was the rooftop Jacuzzi (that they called it infinity pool) that has crockcoach at the drain besides! I complained to the staff and they replied me ""it is okay what. Not inside the pool"" Hello? So you want me to enjoy the view of your dirty drain? And from where the crockcoach came from? If not from the 'pool' itself. ",2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Dirty pool,
The best of Singapore MBS! the pool was pack of guest!well..I guess you gotta experienced the highest pool!  The food was lovely and walking distance to the casino and shops! not the best for shopping its a bit expensive..,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,57th floor,
"Marina Sands Hotel is structurally impressive, however you are one of 1000s there. The rooms are overpriced compared to other 5 star hotels around the world.  Great view of the bay, lovely staff, and very good accommodation compared to other hotels in Singapore. The infinity pool is incredible but you are there with 100s of others...so not relaxing! Disappointing that use of pool and breakfast is not included in expensive room rates. All that said would I stay there again...most likely! ",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Me and many ,

Good service, rooms are spacious with full toiletries. Enjoyed my stay .",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Enjoyed my stay,
The room was good and very comfortable and so it should be at S$615 a night! The infinity pool and views are spectacular. We stayed three nights and were there especially to celebrate a 50th birthday - no acknowledgement nor good wishes given. I can't help feel that it would be better to stay at another hotel across the way and be able to look at this incredible building rather than stay in it!,3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,"Stunning place, but impersonal",
This is the most prestigious hotel in Singapore. It has the well know MBS top deck overlooking all Singapore as well as the famous seathrough borderless swimming pool on top floor which is amazing. The hotel is full of glamorous decorations and huge vases. It is connected to a casino and a luxurious shopping mall. Also connected to the famous Marina Bay Gardens,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing hotel,
"The room was nice, the pool was nice, the breakfast was nice but at any given time you felt like being at Mumbai or Shanghai main train station during rush hour. My recommendation go for dinner/drink on the roof top and save your money for a less crowded 5 star hotel",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Nice but too crowded,
"The hotel is HUMONGOUS, Las Vegas style, not specially charming and yes you come here for the view. Yes the view is great. Rooms are large. But that's about it. Pool is certainly spectacular but overcrowed.  There are plenty other charming hotels in SG to discover.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Ok the view but...,
"A must do destination,3 huge towers and then the roof top pool, wow what a place to go. Food ok but it is a well placed hotel by the gardens, light show with operatic music, Totally dramatic. Its simply iconic and you would not regret this hotel ever.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,largest infinity pool in the world,
"This hotel has all you ever dreamed off. Ignore the angry housewives in the reviews. The staff is kind and everybody takes time for a chat. Of course they are super polite which makes you feel like a VIP :-)  The hotel is an icon, the pool is amazing, the food is great. Also the jacuzzis facing the queue of mega ships at the harbour are an endless joy.  We stayed one night, make sure to check in on time to explore everything. It was a real highlight on our 4 weeks trip through Malaysia and Singapore.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Enriching experience in a great city,
"Booked for a family of four and was given a room with 2 single beds.   Way overpriced for what you get.  The whole place is like a human zoo.  Too many people not enough staff and an American service attitude that does not work in Asia.  There is nothing here beside the pool, it is amazing but not worth the money they charge to stay for a night.  Save your money spend half as much on a better hotel somewhere else, and google pictures of the pool and you will have a much better stay in Singapore. You will also really enjoy Asian hospitality, not some gordy peice of Las Vegas dropped in the middle of Singapore.",1.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Inadequate beds,
For spring break I went to Marina Bay Sands. It was beautiful and fantastic. I swam in the pool and saw a wonderful view from the pool. Managers were so helpful and kind! The food was excellent. The rice was delicious. I had fun and amazing time. Now go! Have same fun at the pool and enjoy the delicious meal in Marina Bay Sands.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Marina Bay Sands,
"We had a one night stopover in this hotel. Great location access to many amenities in hotel and surrounding attractions.

Recommend to check booking from the hotel website, which was the best value at the time I booked.   ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Amazing roof top infinity pool,
I stayed there for 3 times already. First stay was bad experience in 2014 where the concierge misplaced our luggage. next stay was in 2015 for a week which we did not encounter any issue. Third stay was in 2017 only for a night. The reason I keep on coming back is for the sake of the view and the infinity pool. Hotel is huge and massive which we don;t really feel personalized.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Hotel only with breathtaking view,
"This is my top pick in Asia.  Very clean, well organized hotel. Rooms are very clean and excellent. Room service etc is probably one of the best.  All the restaurants are fantastic.  Try spa go's. Check in and checkout and the bell guys are very well trained. The location is very good as the metro is there and the largest high end mall.  The casino is very good too.  Some really good restaurants in the mall too.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,My Top pick in Asia. Excellent hotel,
"I hag a great room but with disappointment the pool was full o screaming children, of noisy instagramers, of people who were not behaving properly! The Management should approve a strict code of behavior for clients, otherwise it is an amusement park , not a luxury Hotel. No one did the room night set.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,ROOM GOOD BUT POOL NEEDS GUIDELINES ,
"This hotel is architecturally thrilling, designed by Moshe Safti - he did not disappoint! The view of the Bay is stunning, the horizon edge pool that floats between all three towers on the 57th floor is worth the price of admission.  Ask for a room between the 8th floor and the 25th floor to maximize your viewing excitement.  Rooms are gracious, food in their many restaurants is great.  I recommend Spagos for breakfast (included in the American Plan) and whatever you do  . . .  don't miss the 22 layer chocolate/Peanut butter cake in Lavo lounge near the pool.  Be sure to take in the light show in the sculpture gardens and the water show in the harbor - both are free and spectacular.  This was just plain FUN!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,JUST PLAIN EXTRAORDINARY!,

"Amazing views and an amazing stay at this iconic hotel. We got a suite on the 52nd floor with an unforgettable view to the bay and the city. The suite was very large and comfortable, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Overall, there is nothing much that can beat a stay in this hotel.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,One of the best stays ever,
this is the go to hotel in Singapore apparently and everyone wants one of the iconic shots of themselves in the roof top pool. However this is a very large hotel with a huge number of guests and although the service is good do not expect five star service and if you want a decent room on a high floor it is worth paying for a club room.The pool is lovely but there are a lot of people enjoying it so it is not a place to go for splendid isolation. That being said the hotel is convenient for anything you might want and has an excellent choice of restaurants.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,pool with a view !,

"Wonderful hotel, but no good costumer service, the rooms needs  modernize, clean,no customized services, no welcome, no nobody interested in helping you or at least show   you where is your room, you  pay really for access to the pool...I've been to other hotels much better.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Very Good.,

Nice food but way too expensive for the price you pay to have local food. Mostly meant for tourists with all the high luxury boutiques. Nothing is really cheap here except if you go Zara or the shops selling sporting goods like Adidas and World of Sports. Mostly meant to target the well to do locals and people who feel they are part of a upper social type. Be prepared to pay anything from $12 to $18 for a plate of Nasi Padang,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Food And Shopping,
"This is the best hotel i visited. With a mall and a casino inside the hotel, restaurants and direct access to the marina bay, the gardens by the bay. Rooms with gardens view can see the show in the night. Amazing experience. The pool on the roof and the view from there is the best thing you get in sinapore. Amazing staff, friendly and helpfull. During check in you got a complimentary mini ice cream and bottle of water. Great food in the restaurants. ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Best hotel i visited,

Loved it!!!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,icionic building,
"My family and I stayed one night to celebrate my granddaughters 21st birthday and we were not disappointed. We had rooms on the 39th floor with a harbour view which was just magnificant. The rooms were large and very nice. You don't have to go anywhere as there is a large shopping centre on ground level with restaurants, super market etc. The view from the infinity pool at night is something again and gardens across from the hotel are just beautiful when lite up at night. The whole experience was well worth the expense.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Absolutely fantasic,
"This was a great 10th year anniversary experience. The hotel was amazing, very modern, and once in a  lifetime experience.  This hotel was a dream stay that I thought would only be a page in a travel magazine.  The room we got was upgraded to a presidential suite offering 180 degrees view of the city, water front and garden.  The room was set up with flowers, wine and fruit basket for our anniversary.  The light show was witnessed from the comfort of our own suite.  The hotel offers exciting shopping experience with brand names.  Just take the elevator, and you are there.  Tons of amenities like the food court, casino and water show.  The best part of all is the Infinity Pool.  Love the view and atmosphere.  Very luxurious experience",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Most Amazing Experience,

"Stayed there for one night only. As many people, we wanted to try the pool. For sure we were not deceived with the view but the pool water was very cold to swim in. The room is nice and big. Took a very long time for the checkin and the kids were so bored of the waiting. ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Just one night,
"We have had an amazing stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated as valued guests - and not a room number as I had thought possible before I arrived - as the Hotel and complex is so BIG! I could fault nothing - the staff were amazing, our room spotless and the view incredible, the Hotel is just Wow! We were staying over Chinese New Year and so were lucky enough to see all the festivities in Singapore. We can't wait to return -  this is really the place to be! Thank you - We  have returned with such wonderful memories! Tina, Paul and Jade",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,WOW WOW WOW !!!,
Its a good place to be and the view is awesome.The photograph taken is quiet expensive. WOrth spending time there for an hour. We spent approximately an hour it was a good experience to be there. Its worth going there once.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Mesmerising view,
"My family of 4 had booked 2 deluxe rooms for our little staycation in Singapore.  Upon check-in, when the woman realized we were a family of 4, she casually mentioned how she upgraded us to a suite with 2 bedrooms (without me asking).  I thanked her and proceeded to our room.  Wow!  For the price of 2 deluxe rooms, we ended up with a Straits Suite on the 54th floor!  No idea what we did as a family to deserve this, but we may never experience this level of luxury again.  Baby grand piano, karaoke room, the list goes on and on.  Over 5 times bigger in area than those 2 original rooms combined, and an even bigger upgrade in terms of room rate.  Thanks, MBS!  As for everything else you'd expect in a major luxury hotel, MBS has it!  Will not disappoint!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Got a huge free upgrade without even requesting!,
"The Marina Bay Sands has the crown jewel, in terms of pools, in Singapore, and maybe in the world. Of course, everyone is blown away by the pool - especially right after a 17hour flight from San Francisco!   However, the excitement starts to fizzle pretty quickly from there. The lengthy waits for the elevators, the million and ten tourists, it is generally far from everything except Gardens by the Bay, oh, and the uncomfortable beds. Service also was pretty lackluster - a 45+ min wait for drinks at the pool... then they delivered the wrong drinks, then charged me.   I would recommend that people go for the experience, leave after the first few days. Would not recommend a lengthy stay.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Not worth the money for a long stay,
"So hard to explain in words about this hotel. It is like a city! Has a mall, casino, bars, restaurants, etc Rooms are very spacious, views are hard to describe, the infinity pool is 150 mts. We are swimmers and swam in the 70 mts lap pool early in the morning. Just worth the stay!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,OMG!,
"The pool is magnificent... as expected, but the rest was a bit of a disappointment.  We booked a sky view room and stayed on the 50th floor... We expected to be wow'ed but the hotel room had a lot lacking.  The toilet could not flush properly, and even when one tissue is flushed it comes back.  The shower was old and the shower head clogged, the water sprayed in all the directions except for down where it's supposed to go. There were great things about the hotel as well but the room and bathroom is old and in need of a revamp.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,I expected more from the renowned marina bay sands,
This is the prominent building with three tower holding up a platform. Atop is the infinity pool which you need to visit at least once. The casino is easy to enter but difficult to exit. My room had a spectacular view of the bay and gardens. The personnel were very prompt at fixing any problems that might occur like a bad shower head or USB connection.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Worth at least one night,

"The Marina Sands Hotel and Casino is amazing, beautiful, and way cool too.  Way up at the top are the swimming pool, deck, bar and restaurant.  You can see the entire Singapore there, so be sure to sit and at least have a drink.  It cost $22 to get up there, but that money is deducted from your drink.  The surroundings are stupendous also.  It was thrilling to be there, especially since it was one of the buildings seen in Crazy Rich Asians!",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Very Impressive!!,
We didn't stay at this hotel . More the potty . But we had an early meal and drinks with friends who live in Singapore . The staff are extremely friendly and efficient despite being incredibly busy as it was towards the end of Chinese New Year . This would undoubtedly be my first choice of hotel in Singapore now .,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Fantastic,
It was my birthday so we tried to stay just 1 night at Marina Bay Sands. So we booked thru their website. I didn't know there's a deposit once you check-in and to be refunded on your check-out. Gladly my brother saves my day. The pool was very crowded by night and even at the morning. We had breakfast at Rise Restaurant which i liked cause they have porridge for my toddler.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Awesome,
"Although the weather was a bit cool, we took advantage of the gorgeous views from the pool our last night in Singapore!  This stay was a treat after a 15 night cruise for me and my husband!  The hotel is a very big property and the shopping and dining options just on the property were numerous.  The views from the bar at the top of the hotel were amazing and I think if I went back to Singapore, I might consider another one night stay.   Room was immaculate, service was five stars!  Felt like a queen! ",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Lovely hotel wonderful room!,
"My issue with this hotel is that the property is too big and therefore not very personalized. From a 30 minute line for check-in to an overcrowded pool area, or a lobby where not only hotel guests but also masses of non staying guests are walking, the hotel consistently lacks a relaxing atmosphere. If you like large Vegas properties, Marina Bay is probably a good fit, just be prepared to pay over $500 per night for a standard room. Just go here for a rooftop dinner and stay at one of the beautiful hotels in the city center.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Not for me,
"Huge hotel complex which means the lobby feels like a cheap shopping mall. Room is nice but this place is a tourist trap. Booked in for one evening as a stop over but there are better hotels in Singapore. Is it worth it for the infinity pool? Mmm. If you are staying in your room, pool, and use the gym, maybe. Venture downstairs and you no longer feel relaxed.   Overpriced for what it is. ",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Over hyped,
"What an amazing stay, somehow after a mishap at checkin we were upgraded to a $1250 suite on the 39th floor with views over the city and the harbour, with dining area, lounge, bedroom, HUGE bathroom with free standing bath overlooking the gardens and the bay plus a powder room. To say nothing of the infinity pool and gym. What a place to stay",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,on top of the world,

Hotel overall was very clean and friendly staff was always at the ready.   We  enjoy the amenities, and the restaurants.   They do have poolside drinks and food.    Many choices of restaurants and a connecting mall (many high end labels) make this such that you would not need to leave.    Hope to return soon.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,It has the WOW factor,
"Awesome is an under statement, super friendly staff. world class infinity pool... Big rooms with superior quality stuff. Only one drawback need to have few more Veg options for Breakfast at Club 55.

"We have seen this hotel advertised on TV at home, so we thought ""go for it"". It's not the cheapest and it's very crowded due its popularity. We had a good experience at check in. The room was very spacious and well equipped and we had benefit of a high up gardens view. If I was to be critical it is that it is a spectacle for all to come and see so it is always busy, noisy and crowded on the ground floor. Our experience of breakfast was good on day 1 but not as slick after. The pool is one of its draws and is also very busy. But hey, this a once in a lifetime and the hotel is a victim of its own successful propoganda. Our stay was great and worth every penny as a one off.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Once in a lifetime experience,
"Great hotel, good location with fantastic views. The roof top pool is a plus but also a novelty. Room on the 39th Floor had really good views out into the city, good bed and lovely bathroom. We've stayed in better 5 star rooms but staying at Marina Bay Sands is about the experience - pool, location, hotel facilities etc. The pool was a highlight but also super busy post 11am - expect sun loungers to be reserved with towels early on and lots of instagrammers, However service from the pool staff was really good and the food also fantastic. We felt it was a really good hotel for a stopover whilst on our way to Thailand.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Three Night Faultless Stay,
Its a very crowdy and huge Hotel. We stayed for 2 days. We were at tower 3 in the 27 level. Very impressive view from our room to the city. And very special view from roof top-pool! We appreciated the direct entry to the metro (MRT) below ground level of the hotel.  Warm welcoming in the hotel. While queuing we got mineral water and icecream!  Although very expensive its worth a visit!,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Very special!,
"We had just 2 nights at MBS but we wished it was longer.  We had a Club room in Tower 2 with a lovely view of the bay and the light show.  Check in was easy in the lounge adjacent to the main check-in desk in Tower 1.  Very efficient.  Our bags arrived in our room very quickly.  Afternoon tea at Club 55 was very nice with a nice selection of sweets, include little scones.  Breakfast at Club 55 is a mix of Eastern & Western foods; I tried only the Eastern foods and they were delicious.  Dinner at Lavo was excellent.  Service at the Concierge desk was amazing as was our smooth check-out.  We're already planning on returning in 2 years and couldn't imagine staying anywhere else.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Second To None,
"We had a room in tower 1 of 3 on 47th floor of 57. Our room was ready when we arrived from flight in am which was great so to the pool on the roof  and literally on top of this city. The water is very cold as there is no insulation around the pool. It goes the whole length of the top with an observatory  area at one end.  There is a bar and lunch served at pool. The observatory area at end and gets very crowded at the restaurant there so go early.  If your room is not included in the observatory, You can pay extra to get a pass to go up.  The Rise restaurant on the first floor has an awesome buffet breakfast with many ethnic  dishes. The rooms are spacious and contemporary and the staff was very attentive.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,High in sky,

yes this hotel is iconic and stunning. We had a marina view on 42nd floor. Rooms were very spacious with all mod cons  but service not quite as expected. Instant coffee in room and in spite of asking for mint tea bags these did not come (not what you expect for The price you pay) The infinity pool although impressive can get very crowded. Breakfast was ok but again restaurants were crowded.  Definately not value for money and while it's a tick off bucket list  I probably wouldn't return even at half the cost.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,pre cruise treat,

"My husband and I stayed here as the first leg of our honeymoon. We don't usually stay at hotels as expensive as this so it was a real treat for us. When it comes to this hotel, I believe you are not just paying for a room. You are paying for the experience, the location, the quality of the staff they employ and obviously the amazing infinity pool on the roof. We had an amazing stay, the room was fantastic as was the view and the location being by the gardens by the bay and the massive shopping center with food court was great.

Wonderful to watch the city lights at night. The infinity pool area was busy even though it was sprinkling. We had to take the obligatory dip.

"You go there for the pool and the amazing city views and that's it. As a hotel it has no personality for being so big and the rooms are quite regular, sort of a standard business hotel design. The bathroom was quite nice though.  I was concerned about the pool being too crowded but if you stay there long enough (I suggest 2 nights at least) and go up there at different times, you get different experiences. For instance it was quite empty and relaxing during midday (maybe due to leavers checking out at 11am and newcomers not checking in until 2-3 pm as earliest) however it was quite busy around sunset and later on.   The daily light show outside the hotel is amazing and Gardens by the Bay is one of the most amazing places to visit in Singapore.",4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,You go there for the pool,
"Stayed at MBS for 2 nights with 4 other couples. First timers. Amazing facility where you don't have to go elsewhere to find food and lots of shopping. Food court was amazing!. Check-in staff very professional and accommodating. Had 2 morning breakfast which is up on the 57th floor by the poolside.  Kudos to waiters like Angelo, Rev and James for doing a superb job in taking good care of us. These people are so wonderful and very friendly. We will definitely stay again at MBS next time we travel to Singapore. Almost forgot, the view while you're on the pool on 57th floor is nothing short of spectacular, especially at night. Make sure you give yourself time to relax on the pool- you'll be amazed. You will run out of selfie poses.",5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Magnificent MBS,
Stayed here during the formula 1....absolutely loved the pool...the pool can be busy but there is always some place where you can sit down... when they saw we were with a little kid they arranged an early check inn with Some extra pay....that was great....the hotel for sure is expensive but its definately worth it.  The good: - amazing pool and also the rest of the skypark is great  - Nice room with a great view - great atmosphere...its really alive - check inn and check out proces.  What can be better: - I missed the old bathroom amenities. The new merk was less good. - it took considerable time before the amount quaranteed via my creditcard was finally settled. - its expensive.,5.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Special place with the best pool ever,
"My wife and I went for 5 nights to Singapore. As we didn't get reservations for 1 of the 5 nights at Marina Bay Sands (where we spent the balance 4 nights), we stayed at the nearby Marina Mandarin.  Our conclusion after the 5-day trip was that the Marina Mandarin was BETTER than Marina Bay Sands on all counts, except the choice of restaurants/bars at the latter.  The Concierge Desk is not able to get reservations at in-hotel restaurants for hotel guests. Waiting for Taxis is too long. The crowd at the Lobby is too large for a Luxury Hotel.",3.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Disappointing Overal,
Had a slightly tired room on 47th floor with club 55 access for a couple of nights. People must come for pool photos as it was very busy and not at all relaxing. The same comments apply for the club 55 lounge. Massive hotel so you can't expect quiet.  Obviously great views but I easily prefered Ritz Carlton opposite. Never again.,4.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Butlins for asia,
"We stayed in the straits suite for one night and it was over the top.

After being cut off twice (I think the office is in China) I was told to write an e-mail.  Then I got a response that they would not correct the ""non-refundable"" reservation.

"It was our first time in Singapore and our experience was outstanding from the start. From arrival at the hotel the staff were pleasant and extremely efficient. The room was more than adequate for our stay and was well kept throughout. Breakfast at the hotel was excellent with a wide choice of food, all of a high quality. The highlight of our stay at the hotel was the swimming pool and pool side bar where we spent some relaxing time every day. In particular the service from Magen and Ralph was outstanding.Their  service, attention to detail and local knowledge are to be highly commended. We are really sorry our holiday has come to an end.

"Visited Pan Pacific after 3 years and came away pretty much disappointed. Right from the website which did not allow me to make a direct booking to staff who were cold at all times., it appears that the pandemic has  made the the property rusty in their approach. The iron in the room had chocolate on its plate and the tea / coffee had not been restocked. Inspite of the fact that the gym is supposed to be open for 24 hours, i found the same closed till 7am. Breakfast spread remains good and the bar on the ground floor is a good place to meet for a late evening meeting. Overall pretty much disappointing experience.",3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Disappointing experience,
"As soon as we checked in, it became apparent that Pan Pacific did not employ enough staff. We waited quite a while at the check in counter. Fortunately, some extra staff processed our check in at their discovery counters.  Then we partook of their executive lounge. The service here was excellent. I would like commend Shine for her attentiveness to our needs.   Part of our needs was the extra water. We asked for this from room service, and it took more than 4 hours for the extra bottled water to arrive.   The beds and room was clean and their pillow menu made our sleep super relaxing. We also got a welcome gift because it was my wife's birthday.  We appreciated the personal touch.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Mixed bag of service,

"I placed the order for 2+1 beds for one night/room in the reservation, And I also have confirmed with the reception that we have ordered 2+1 extra beds requirement.  I and my parents waited more than an hour for the 2+1 extra bed, then I decide to make a call to the reception to check the status.  The staff told me that the facilities team will come to us shortly.  So, in the end, the extra bed reaches me an hour after the call!  I am not sure is it still my fault, what if I keep calling them to make it until frustrated. then I will not deserve to wait for the 2 hours.   Anyway, what is satisfactory that I paid $690/per night for 5 stars hotel to let Pan Pacific serve me in 2 or 3 stars hotel service. What a fantastic service in Singapore! really impressive and arrogant.",1.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,"""It maybe deserves to 5 stars in the past, But... not now, it should drop or downgrade to 2 or 3 stars.”",

"Very good hotel and with a bit more effort would be excellent.  Kettle missing in room and the app chat request is a bit clunky making it a long-winded process to have missing kettle and request extra towels.  Staff weer friendly and competent.  Biggest complaint was the quality of the food/compared to the very high price and the ""process"" at breakfast.  Serving yourself buffets (especially for things that don't have to be cooked especially) are not likely to add to the COVID risk and the weird way in which the buffet is set up makes it much more likely that if a hotel guest had COVID, he/she, by walking all over the giant and complex breakfast room, would be more likely to spread it than having guest serve themselves at a more logically arranged buffet.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Pan-Pacific - almost excellent,

Clearly understaffed resulting in subpar service, especially for the amount paid, which is even through a themed room, pricing was like a suite rate. Very poor service.  Also, when I realised I forgot to bring my swim shorts, I called Service One for help. Response was basically ""too bad"" and ""go figure it out yourself"".

Little gestures like this made our day. Complimentary dessert was sent to our room as birthday gift, that was very thoughtful. Only thing that caught me aback as I used to have frequent staycation at Pan Pacific,  this room came with totally no coffee cups, complimentary teas or coffee. As we were also too tired to be bothered by it, and the great service from Abhi and TJ has kind of compensated this oversight. So we did not make any request for them to be sent to our room.

However, the balcony is a disappointment, can't be enjoyed as the food smell is always there, perhaps due to 12th floor not high enough, or due to poor smell filtration of the restaurants at lower floors. Had I known, I would have considered a room with bath-tub and forego the balcony. certified SG Clean? I have my doubts as there were obvious food crumbs on the office chair upon check-in; also noticed a very long hair at the shower floor before I used it.

Screen in the bathroom was not working upon check in, wasted like 30 mins for technician to rectified.  Went to the club lounge with my child.  Confectionary were served by default, have overlooked that there was a kids menu.  If was asked of this option, the lounge experience would be more enjoyable for my child.

"Everything was wonderful but could I make two suggestions: in-room refreshments could be improved with a Nespresso machine. Many other 5-star hotels at similar price points have that in their rooms, it would be a nice addition.   Secondly, guests are required to book facilities such as the pool and gym however there does not appear to be a limit to the number people allowed at the pool since it was so crowded there was literally no space to swim. I think either the booking system could be scrapped or there should be a limit to the number of guests in the pool.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,"Great room, location, service",

It was a Saturday buffet brunch and it was full. I brought my elderly mom to edge for lunch and didn't pre request for a table nearer the buffet due to her not being able to walk so well. The restaurant was full. Every table was taken. However Crystal took the extra effort to find me the best available table and took care of us. The food and service were great.

We initially wanted to leave but the staff called Aidil patiently walked us through the buffet offering and asked the chef to specially cook for us if we wanted to eat certain food as there were not much food left at that hour. He even took order from our table and brought the food to us for a buffet meal. He noted that we have baby eating with us and might be difficult to grab the food in the short span of time.

Quantity is so little that we have to highlight, could we have more please ? Did highlight to Fang Mei about the pastas who quickly highlighted to the manager.

"For the price I paid for the family package, I don't think it was very worth it. Kids' activities were only happening on the weekends. Given that it's school holidays, they should have more kids activities even on weekdays.   The worse experience was at breakfast. I felt like I was eating in the canteen. Food choices were very limited, pale in comparison to pre-covid days. There were other hotels who could offer better menu even in covid times.   We were rushed to finish our breakfast within a certain time, food cannot be customised. They were all prepared beforehand and thrown onto your table. It was really a far cry from before.",3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,So-So,

"Everything during the stay was alright except during check-in when we were told to wait a while as the room we booked is not available. We had to wait for about 15 mins before getting to our room. The room had pretty much all the essentials that were required. We particularly loved the view of the marina bay from our hotel room which made us in awe. For those who needs to use the gymnasium or swimming pool, booking could be done through your mobile device which was very convenient. However, much of the gym slots for the day were taken up when I tried to book a slot at about 4pm. In gist, it was a pleasant stay besides some hiccups here and there. Needless to say, the location of the hotel is within walking distance from a number of shopping malls.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,EXCELLENT VIEW FROM HOTEL ROOM,

Also glad that the hotel was gracious enough to provide us connecting rooms so my friends and I had a very good bonding together. They also give amazing service most especially to club members.  Their food are good as well. I like their cocktails and their in house cocktail. We were served by a gracious guest service executive, Angel and had a lot of fun in their lounge. Recommended that you try to experience their lounge as well and cocktails. They have the best view at night, well even in daylight though.  Will definitely be back here.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Best experience and amazing hotel to stay,

However, the paranomic room was not as paranomic I felt it would be as it was being blocked by SMBC building. The facilities at the gym , mini games corner is good; not old. The complimentary breakfast was disappointing with little to choose from via ala carte order. Hoping that it would have more range with past experiences from other hotel stays. However, breakfast was decent to eat. Hotel bed: hard but comfortable. Pillows were very soft. Hence recommend to ask more pillow! Or else risk a neck pain. Overall, this hotel is good for family to stay in. ",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Smooth check in.,

Check-in was a breeze with the help of Khalili & Stella although there was a long queue(probably due to the long weekend..) Was given the room on the 21st floor and it was super nice with a really nice view. Did have some minor problems with the TV but it got rectified straight away by the technician.

"Owing to the Covid situation, we decided to spend Chinese New Year at Pan Pacific Singapore and opted for 2 nights instead of our usual overnight stay.  Notwithstanding some inconveniences due to the Covid measures, we are still happy with the service and facilities.  Attention to details such as collecting payment only at check-out because of Covid and bringing new toiletries (without us requesting for it) does differentiate the hotel from others that we had stayed.  It is not our first time at this hotel, and it remains one of our favourites.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,A hotel that doesn't disappoint,

Both men then assisted with my luggage, all the while showing great empathy, warmth and concern. Check in was a breeze. The rooms were clean and spacious with a gorgeous view of the harbour. Did have an issue with the TV console but was quickly rectified by the technician. The coffee machine was an added bonus, and top up of capsules was a call away. On my departure, Encik Ismail and TJ quickly assisted with the luggage, always with a warm smile and a helping hand.

"The staff were genuinely friendly and happy to serve you. Despite the pandemic, they have managed to adapt to the demands of it with the buffet service via ala carte online ordering; food gets delivered to you to your table seamlessly by choosing from a menu online. The rooms were very nice, they don't have those card slot things that turns off all the power when you take out your card and leave your room; so your room can stay cool with the AC on when you get back. The hotel is connected to a mall so you don't even have to go outside to shop or dine.  I left behind a valuable item and the housekeeping team did an excellent job; I got back my item the following day. So my faith in humanity is restored. Kudos Pan Pacific! I will be returning again in the future.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Excellent service and wonderful amenities,

"When our cruise had to be aborted mid way due to C-19, we found our selves ""stuck"" in Singapore for a few days in mid February 2020. Staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore turned what could have been a nightmare into one of the highlights of our lives. What an amazing place, perfectly situated in an amazing country.  While present at an uncomfortable time for the staff, they stood their places with exceeding grace and hospitality. When our reservations got turned inside out by ongoing changes, management continued to ""straighten out"" our account even after we had been suddenly flown back to Canada!

"An excellent hotel in the Marina Bay area of Singapore. The hotel has good facilities, the staff are friendly and helpful, as is everyone in Singapore. The pool and gym are well provisioned. The rooms are comfortable, well stocked and extremely clean. Only downside is that the breakfast is expensive at S$38 plus tax, but this is cheaper than the standard rate if booked in advance via the reception.

The club lounge was a nice room but the breakfast was a disgrace .  Just a hot plate with a chef cooking sub standard eggs .  The fruit selection was extremely poor and un varied . Probably the worst club breakfast we have ever had .  You can eat in the normal breakfast room but it was packed and very noisy .  All in all we were very disappointed and would not use this hotel again .",3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Not up to standard,

"Be careful booking & paying 100% upfront with this hotel - upon checkin, what we had paid for could not be provided and hotel seemed to be in no position to offer what was paid for. Room was not ready at checkin time of 7pm nor was room ready at 2230 despite two phonecalls to reception seeking the second bed for our child who, exhausted, ended up sleeping in the main bed on our first night. It seemed we had two options at this point; continue in 'dialogue' with the hotel and let it consume us or try to 'make do' for the reminder of our stay on our once in a lifetime trip to Singapore. We chose the later. Location was ideal for us and after the above, our experience with all the other members of their staff was perfect",2.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Family holiday,

We didn't find anything about our three nights there special and I think we expected to.  Everything was just.... lovely.   Overall, it was a nice hotel and we would have no problem staying there again for the right price.  The value wasn't there for us because by the time we chose a room with an upgraded view we could have stayed at the MBS for a little more, which is what we'll do the next time we are in Singapore.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Perfectly Lovely Hotel,
"I booked a room with 2 single beds and sent an email to confirm this need. However, upon check in they said there were no rooms available with this configuration. They upgraded to a larger room with a queen size bed and a sofa bed. However, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable and I had to request a room change. Finally, they put us in a room with 2 single beds without balcony because in my reservation there was a balcony as I had booked. Anyway, my expectations with the hotel were not so satisfactory for its high price.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Wonderful location and good service.,
Specially booked Pan Pacific to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. Made the booking via Agoda and requested for high floor and baby cot as well as indicated that it was for our wedding anniversary. Not too sure if my request was fully communicated to the hotel as only the baby cot was provided and was allocated 5th floor to stay. The check in process was abit long perhaps due to weekend. Would have been a nice gesture if the hotel provides a cake to commemorate our wedding anniversary but the hotel did not.  Nonetheless it was a pleasant stay and the breakfast was good,4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Staycation,
"The stay here is top notch, we really enjoyed having the hotel connected to both Marina Square and Sun Tec.

"We enjoyed our staying in Pan Pacific! The location, breakfast, staff and rooms were great! It is worth adding breakfast when you book the hotel. We booked one King bed and double bed room without knowing they were on different floors. When we checked in, one of the reception staff helped us to find connecting rooms together and we were upgraded to the panoramic view rooms. Early check in was not an issue either.

"The Pan Pacific is well located, and rooms are well appointed.  Reasonable sized rooms, and nice communal areas.  There are so many hotels in Singapore, and not much to distinguish between many of them frankly.  This hotel appears popular with air crew, as we saw many during our stay.    We happened to mention that we had vegans in our largish party, and the manager of the breakfast buffet arranged for us to have some additional vegan dishes made (as is common in SE Asia, vegan and vegetarian options are fairly limited, even at breakfast). He organised some splendid additional vegan dishes for our table, which was much appreciated, so a special shout out is much deserved for that good level of service.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Shout out to Breakfast Manager!,

"Had decided to check in for a night Xmas stay. Despite being festive and busy period, service was not compromised with prompt room service upon our requests. Breakfast at the Edge was not disappointing. Had visited before for buffet lunch, food quality was as usually good and with much variety.   Hotel rooms & facade was visible refurbished. Very unique hotel setting.  Room was spacious with good bedding. May suggest to consider looking into better pillow menu options for a better experience.  Some reconsiderations maybe put into place with regards to the bathroom tap. Its really rather awkward on the positioning of the tap vs the basin.   However, overall experience was pleasant and good. Will return again. ",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Xmas Staycation,
This is our third visit to Singapore and the Pan Pacific was by far the worst hotel we stayed in. We found our suite to be rather grimy and has a damp smell. Unlike all the other hotels this hotel charged us for a early check in even though the room was ready. After our first day of sightseeing we returned at 11pm to find our room had not been serviced. We can definitely not recommend this hotel to travelers. ,3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Disappointing ,
Best hotel I have ever stayed in. A pacific Club room is a must. The room and bath room are amazing. Cocktail hour in the evening was incredible.

"Having recently stay at the Pan Pacific we were very disappointed with the hotel.   There was no warm welcome on arrival, reception were not very welcoming and the room was just another hotel room. But knowing it was our 40th wedding anniversary the bed had some petals, small cakes and a card, which was very nice, but seemed like an afterthought, when they were informed months ahead. It gave us the impression of a business hotel for individuals who just wanted a good, clean room for the night.  The breakfast was good and location is very good.   But for couples wanting something a little special I would not recommend.  Very much a run of the mill business hotel with no personality  or warmth to guests.",3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Disappointing,

The prices in the Atrium bar - be aware they do not include GST and service.  Breakfast was seriously impressive - huge choice of well cooked / presented meals.  EXCEPT - the qualifty of the coffee and tea served are poor.  It would be better to install the european style 'self serve machines' which do produces excellent hot drinks.  The room was all one could hope for, spacious and comfortable, great bath and shower room.  Impressive views over the harbour.  Apart from the breakfast hot drink, everything was very good.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Excellent,
"A quality hotel in a busy modern city translates into lots of people enjoying the services.    Often this ends up making the clients feel a bit rushed or not important.

Location = great, two MRT stops within walking distance although you really could just live in the hotel without ever leaving. Amenities = great.  Its one of the Pan Pacific line.

"We are lucky enough to have stayed in the Pan Pacific three times now. This is a great hotel. You feel special from the moment you arrive to the minute you leave. The staff are what makes this hotel so special. The concierge, the breakfast team, check in everyone cannot do enough for you. It is worth paying a little extra for a harbour view studio. The views are spectacular especially at night. We had breakfast and again first class, so much variety. I tried to have something different every day and we were there a week.Location is spot on. Just a short (air con) walk through a mall and out onto the Esplanade and bay. Worth noting they have a lovely relaxing area with teas and coffee near the pool if you have a late flight. We will return, thank you Pan Pacific.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel in great location,

Lovely hotel in the heart of Singapore within easy walking distance of most attractions. Singapore is a extremely clean city and also is the hotel. We stayed on a high floor with reasonable views however the marina side would have had better views but this was not an issue to us as not actually in room much. Breakfast was excellent with a good variety for all. Staff as all people in Singapore were very polite and helpful. We would definitely recommend the Pan Pacific Singapore,5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Wonderful stay in Singapore,
opt for a promotion given to Discovery Club members for club rooms.  Was apprehensive from previous reviews read whereby staff provide different service to locals and overseas travellers.  This was not the case and we were warmly greeted and well served whenever we visited the club lounge.  Rooms are also clean and big!!,5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Pan Pacific Club,
"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.  Was here with a colleague for a few nights.  Location is excellent, and fabulous view from balcony over Marina Bay Sands and Gardens in the Bay - spectacular at night.  Room service impeccable, staff so friendly and helpful - no issue about extending checkout to 2pm and storing luggage longer.  Breakfast a truly international cuisine.  I played safe with cooked-to-order eggs and omelettes - multiple chefs so very little waiting even when the restaurant was busy.  And I dined in the Rang Mahal one night - a great Indian menu with some great choices.  I only wish they had slightly quicker elevators (could be a lot of hanging around in the morning) but this didn't detract - this is a great hotel.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Great hotel,
"Held dinner wedding at Hai Tien Loh.. the service provided by them was great. All staffs are very helpful and do their best to fulfil our requests.

Great job to William and his team! Highly recommended them to you. Keyaki at pan pacific also a very great ambience place.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Hai Tien Loh @ Pan Pacific,

Looking forward to returning. ,5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Fabulous,
"Visited here many times on business and love it. The staff are fantastic, the breakfasts are to die for.

"Stayed here 4 nights for part of our honeymoon trip and really loved it.  Amazing location, beautiful room with gorgeous view and staff were absolutely amazing throughout the stay.  They did some extra things to make our honeymoon special. We also payed the extra for the pan pacific club and would highly recommend! Better breakfast and free cocktail hour and afternoon tea with top floor views of the harbour. And the staff at the club were top notch - always made sure you had a full glass of whatever you were drinking and were super friendly. Definitely made it worth the money. Would definitely stay here again. ",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Amazing,

"This really is an excellent hotel with great facilities. We booked a club room and we would recommend anyone to do this as you can then enjoy the benefits of having breakfast on the 38th floor with great views of the Marina Bay district. Also the Club access allows you to join for afternoon tea and for cocktails and food on an evening which is included in the price. This was a fantastic offer and the service was great (a special mention to Mia who was a wonderful hostess). The location of the hotel is also brilliant as you are in the heart of all of the main sights, Suntec City next door is also a cool shopping mall. Overall the hotel was excellent!",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel in Top Location!,
"We cannot fault the Pan Pacific, cleanliness friendliness, if on the rare occasion there may have been a slight snag, it was rectified very quickly.

"The hotel is very handy for both Suntec and MBS convention centres, shopping and transport. Rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. Good internet connectivity. Bathroom has a shower only and has nice amenities. Great choice of breakfast items, coffee service is a little slow. The hotel also has a sizeable swimming pool with enough deck chairs to accommodate guests. The lobby is very impressive. The lifts are a little slow at times, also the TV channel selection is a bit patchy. Despite that, I would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to anybody.

The staff is courteous and helpful, the rooms are beautifully furnished, modern and surprisingly large. The lobby is spectacular and you are within walking distance of all the major Singapore sites.

"Stayed 5 nights in Pacific Club room and was extremely disappointed to have the same food at cocktail time on nights 1,3 and 5 and the same on nights 2 and 4... quality was ok but variety was severely lacking for such an expensive room choice and 5 star hotel... Would definitely stay again as the hotel staff are excellent and cannot do enough for you and the facilities are great but as an experience overall it was quite underwhelming especially as it was for our 30th Wedding Anniversary ",3.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Disappointed in the food variety for a 5 star venue.,

"It is located in the center of the city.  My expectation level was not that high as it is not global brand and a bit old.  But it was far way better than my expection level.

Up to floor 22 and floor 23 upwards. We were on 16 on the opposite side of the building to the lifts. Fabulous views at night, not too good during the day because of the burnt rainforest smog, sadly. Food is very good but expensive. The evening buffet is a legend.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Very good but on the expensive side,

Malls had good food at very reasonable prices for Singapore.  A huge shout out to the concierge, who was very helpful and had good tips and ideas.  Check in and check out was easy.

The Pan Pacific is right up there when it comes to room design (ie modern enough, yet all the amenities, great size room) but what really stands out there was their breakfast. It caters for everyone's needs whether you like a Japanese breakfast, an American omelet or some curries. This was certainly a highlight. The only thing that could be better from their breakfast is the coffee. Coming from Australia, where we are spoilt with amazing coffee, this was the only thing that I thought could be improve.

"It took 45 minutes for me to check out; approximately 15 minutes per person to get processed. Some people who lined up in a queue later than me got served before I got served, which was not very fair. Other than this, it was a reasonably good hotel in general.",1.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Too long time to check out.,
"Stayed here for 3 nights. Good quality of sleep, multiple MRT stations around (downtown/blue line nearer or walk abit to go to north-south/red line) and very great hospitality by staff on the ground. You can get all the common brands shopping you need at your doorstep and housekeeping is very on point (with exception they forgot to refill teabags).",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Almost perfect,
"The staff was very helpful during my visit. At one point I was lost, and at another point I needed help moving my luggage. Shawal, from concierge, was very helpful on both occasions. He led me directly to the conference venue I was looking for and he efficiently moved my luggage from one room to another. ",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Very helpful staff,
"Only can say we enjoyed our stay with Pan Pacific Singapore! It's excellent and professional services from Mr Nicholas Loke, Guest care services officer who answered my questions in professional and patience and Front office staff, Mr Abel (not sure the spelling is correct) who is so polite and friendly and efficient and the lady who helped me to arrange complimentary cake for my aunt as the day itself is her birthday! My partner was requested her to expedite the delivery time to 15 mins instead of 30 mins and she is really professional and able to send us on time.

The malls also offer another place to eat should you wish to try Singaporean cuisine.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,A good location to start your trip around Singapore,
We are staying at this hotel at the beginning of our holiday. All very good. Bedrooms are clean and tidy. Hotel positioned for touring Singapore. Overall no complaints.  The shopping centres are really close. Great food in both of them. Accessing the shopping centres is very easy just through the door at the back of the hotel. Access to the tube is excellent. The coffee machine in the bedroom is a nice touch,4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Perfectly fine,
"Was there to celebrate one of my friend belated birthday. Food was great as usual. Anna at the restaurant was gorgeous and attentive. She helped us to take a group photo, and ended up she is not convinced of the photo taken due the messy plates and utensils on the table. Immediately, she cleared it away and offered to retake the group photo again. Well done, Anna!  *On top of the cake bought on our own, the restaurant also prepares another slice of cake for my friend.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Anna from Edge restaurant,
"This was my second visit to the Edge Restaurant at Pan Pacific for a birthday dinner. The service rendered by the restaurant staffs were great, especially a particular gentleman named Frankie.

He even took time to get us a birthday cake despite the restaurant being overwhelmingly busy. Highly commendable.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Amazing service at Edge Restaurant,

"Pan Pacific is without a doubt a nice hotel, but more if you are on vacation and not on a business trip.  Elevators are exhausting slow and malfunctioning. I had several 5-10 minute rides on the elevator to get from one room to the other especially if one room was on the lower level and the other on the higher level.   Breakfast buffet is vast, however very poor if you are looking for fresh pressed juices smoothies and other vegan options. Same in the hotel it was impossible to get a vegan snack at one of the restaurants downstairs which also applies to the room service menu.  The location is awesome pool area and access to the mall are great. however, as mentioned would not recommend it as a business hotel",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,5 star hotel,
Great hotel for a short stay. Basically you can get everything from the mall next door. No need to go to other places as you can shop most things and eat under one roof.  Saves a lot of travelling time.,4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Efficient stay as the hotel is right next to mall.,
"Stayed here for one night with a family member, the room which I stayed in has a balcony with a direct  view of the Singapore CBD as well as the merlion and a paritial view of marina bay sands. The view is espeically nice during the night. Room wise, it was clean and spacious. The only negative comment was the room has a musty smell each time you entered. Seems the aircon does not turn on if no one is in the room. This aside, overall had a pleasant stay.",4.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Great Views,
"We stayed here for a couple of nights on the way back to Australia.  We booked a club room which is well worth the additional $$ as you get drinks and very generous canapes each evening, and breakfast in the morning with an excellent breakfast.  The view from the club was amazing as was the view from our room.  The service was good and the pool was lovely (although slightly too warm).  It is in a good spot and has an enormous shopping centre underneath.",5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Wow! Amazing hotel!,
We could not have asked for a better place to stay in Singapore.  It was our first time in the city and staff went beyond to provide us with all the info that we needed. The breakfast was the BEST that we have ever experienced.,5.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,A FABULOUS hotel & staff,
"We stayed in Pan Pacific for three nights in a deluxe twin room with balcony at level 6.   The first night after the shower at 11 pm, the simple hair dryer did not work; and ended up sleeping with damp hair. The next morning all the room light also ceased to function!   The buffet breakfast were spread out in many centres but there was nothing tasty enough to excite our palate. There were better buffet breakfast experiences in nearby hotels of similar star rating, of which we looked forward every morning.   Overall feeling after three days: Awesome but impractical layout, room design and the furnishings. Appearing beautiful but failing to give comfort!

"It all started ok. Rooms are a bit shabby but fine. Then my room got this weird chemical smell and I asked to be moved only to get a stinky smoking room!! The team has tried but the whole experience is poor. I will not recommend this hotel. For this money, you can get much more modern accommodations and more helpful service.",2.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Unhappy,
Absolutely stunning views from this hotel of the marina.  We stayed with family and were in rooms on the 10th and 7th floor. The rooms were very spacious and had everything you needed and comfy beds and pillows.  Room service was brilliant and the food was top notch.  Plenty of room at the swimming pool and again amazing views.  Perfectly situated to get around.  We were greeted with cold cans of water and towels on our arrival back from a run early one morning which really was a great touch.   Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Amazing views, perfect location - highly recommend",
"On a family trip from Japan, when my wife's PCR tested positive and it was difficult to return home, Mandarin Oriental cared for my wife with a warm letter and a gift. In addition, the hotel sent a technician to my wife's isolated room for another PCR, which came back negative and allowed her to return to Japan. For travelers, the hotel is far more dependable than the embassy, and I have the greatest respect for their dedication and hospitality.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great hospitality and thoughtfulness towards guests,
"This is a five star plus international hotel. Luxurious, clean, well appointed and well maintained rooms, common areas and amenities. Views over bay from guest rooms and pool are magnificent.

All restaurants five star for food and service (Steakhouse, Japanese, Chinese and Italian). Bars are top notch with great vibe.

Keep up the good work & Thank you to all the service staff that attended to us.  Best regards,  Frederick.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Wedding lunch,
"I am a fan, so I do stay a lot at the MOs, and also ranked top tier among the fans.   This hotel in Singapore is not up to it. Dated interior, understaffed, and service people seemed to be in training. Unruly kids were permitted to chase each other screeching and screaming in the echo chamber of the atrium. One could hear them 10 levels apart as if one be on a playground. None of the staff made an effort to tell the adoring parents that their kids' riot is not music to their peoples ears.   After my booking expired I switched hotels to stay elsewhere for 10 days, and for sure I will never return.",1.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Not up to it,
"Overall we had a great experience with Mandarin Oriental Singapore. The hotel is well-known and well located in the heart of Marina bay. The staff were accommodating. We had a Club Marina Bay King Room and access to the business lounge. The room was beautiful, clean, and perfect for enjoying the holidays. The breakfast was good, with delicious cuisines from around the world. The hotel is also ideal for business and leisure. We are impressed and will recommend it to our family and friends.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent experience at Mandarin Oriental Singapore,

She responded to all our queries in a timely and detailed manner. We were never left wanting or in the dark at any point in time. The rest of the hotel and banquet staff were also very helpful and attentive. They were always on hand before and during our wedding to assist and guide us for minor details that we had not considered in our planning.

"When booking the hotel room, I indicated that I wanted to have a good view of the fireworks from the NDP rehearsal. The staff emailed us suggesting to get a room with Marina Bay View instead of Ocean view. I appreciate the proactiveness of the staff. We had a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay & the fireworks!   Also, when we entered the room, they left us wine/champagne & some kuih. We can't consume it so we called the staff to have it back. We didn't expect them to apologise and replace it with chilled orange juice.  Also, even though the restaurant do not have halal option, there are many halal certified restaurants and fast food outlet at Marina Square just beside the hotel. It's very convenient.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,A Breathtaking View Of The Marina Bay & The Fireworks!,

Great views of the Marina Bay - Amazing staff, really friendly  - Superb breakfast (so much choice and really good quality) - Excellent fitness centre and swimming pool facilities  Negatives: - I was really excited for the room type I had booked, however it seemed really dated. It wasn't the cleanest too on arrival. It seemed like rushed. The rooms are becoming dated and should be renovated - I felt the rate paid wasn't worth it which was disappointing ",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Generally good, however felt like I had overpaid as the room was dated and had issues.

"We as a family enjoyed our stay at the hotel - rooms were good.  Service was good but not great. At breakfast it was very frantic despite the hotel not even being so busy.  We were frustrated on multiple occasions when we tried to call housekeeping, reception and room service without any answer. This happened on multiple occasions - not just 'busy times'.    For the amount I am spending (3 times more than a good 4 star hotel) I just expected an incredible experience rather what one would expect from a decent 4 star hotel.    Would I stay here again - probably not.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Decent hotel but expected more,

Everything is considered perfect (from check-in till I check-out) during the stay except that the bed is too soft. My mum and I have shared the same thoughts. Thus we didn't really sleep much the whole night. I must compliment the lady staff (didn't manage to get her name) who have assisted with the check-in who is so attentive and observant. She could sense that my elderly mum seem looking around for seats in the lobby while waiting for the check-in to be done. The staff asked me to bring my mum to area where there is sofa while she is processing the check-in. It is really such small gesture that makes the start of the whole staycation experience pleasant.

I was gifted a 3 hour Spa experience for my birthday and it was beyond incredible. I have had many spa treatments at many hotels over the years but this was a notch above! In particular the wrap with a 40 minute head massage plus the 1.5 hour inner strength massage coupled with hot stones provided a state of relaxation never before experienced! Highly recommend!,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,3 hour Spa Experience was truly NEXT LEVEL,
"Overall an above average hotel stay. The common areas are stunning, however room is dated and breakfast quality is below average. The Nasi Lemak had no protein at all except an otah and a boiled egg. The hotel might attribute this to the enhance measure by the government that restricts dining in, but Park Royal Marina Bay is serving Nasi Lemak with lobsters and all.",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Room needs an upgrade to keep it in line with the MO brand,

"The whole experience we had from the moment we step in MOSIN till the end of our staycation was awesome! The room was well prepared with amenities and we didn't expect there were balloons with drawing on it to greet our kids. A cute small tent was another surprise for the kids. Never expect that my kids enjoy so much, end up I will have to prepare them in the bath tub 3 times a day! Breakfast at the Melt cafe was wonderful too, lot of choices to choose from American breakfast to Asian breakfast. It is so convenient that Marina Square is just beside the hotel where you can do a shopping or to have a meal, not forgetting Pororo park and Kiztopia is located there too. Lastly, well done to the Team and we will definitely be back again soon!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fantastic Staycation!,

Especially, thanks to the friendly staff, I had a pleasant check-in, and the staff who helped check in by telling me about the room were very surprised with two things as soon as I opened the door. 1) spacious room 2) Surprise event decorated with cute balloons and snacks In particular, my 3-year-old son loved it for the kid-friendly hotel.

"Went for a staycay to celebrate couple's anniversary. They accommodated to all my requests, such as getting a bouquet of flowers at a very reasonable price, and which were also extremely fresh. Also provided us with a slice of cake and helped us to take a photo as a momento.   Not the end, they allowed for late check out all the way till 6pm, which was a great courtesy given by them. Pool was great too, venue was super near marina square/suntec for meals if not dining at the hotel.   Kinda wished I had a slightly higher floor as I went on a weekday, but hey I'm nitpicking already haha.  All in all though, fantastic service and definitely recommend MO as a venue for staycation.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Staycation,

The front desk is also warm and welcoming. Room was clean although the bathtub didn't really work. Upgraded to ocean view which was amazing (somehow better than marina bay view although the second one is more ex). The highlight of our stay is the pool! It is big and not crowded. My toddler loves the pool a lot. Even when we stayed at the 6 starts hotel just beside this, she keep pointing at this swimming pool. Such a memorable things for her.

Buffet breakfast spread was impressive but turnaround time could be better. (No halal option, FYI)   Rooms were clean. Baby cot was comfy.  Pool was fun for the kids.  They even offered ice water by the pool side at no cost. The housekeeping team even gave us baby soap and a mask for my 10 year old. Excellent personal touch. Walking distance to esplanade, suntec and marina square.   Each room were offered $80 - $100 dining vouchers. You may utilized it at the certain restaurants. They were flexible enough to allow my friends to utilize it as I was not able to as it was non-halal restaurant.   Keep it up MO! ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great Staycation,
"We had a short staycation, and what made the stay really special was the pool (we went daily). The view of the Bay was fantastic. But what was even better than was the pool staff, led by Pradeep. On the first day, we thought we'd try our luck even though we didn't have a booking. Perhaps seeing my two young children, Pradeep said he could accommodate us because the pool happened to be relatively empty at that point in time. The flexibility and understanding was really appreciated. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great pool staff,

Yes, we went back because the place really is that good, classy modern, squeaky clean, manned with excellent staff, awesome room with Marina bay view, and amazing unlimited breakfast sets. I probably gained weight because of it. Ooops.  We opted to return because my wife and I didnt want to risk going to another hotel as MO had already exceeded our expectations.   Mike, in particular, accomodated us well and made our entire experience very pleasing. Overall, the service team did an amazing job keeping our rooms tidy, and they were very prompt to respond with all our requests.   Highly recommended. We will surely be back!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Superb hotel experience,

"Excellent: SERVICE (throughout the hotel from pre-trip to restaurant to check-in to housekeeping and room service); room size and amenities; pool and gym facilities  Ok: room is not the most modern as the hotel was last renovated in 2004 (according to Wikipedia); view from the room (probably could have requested for one with better view as ours was facing Suntec City and Pan Pacific Hotel)  Room for improvement: really nothing much; of course if the hotel decides to close for renovation or refurbishment of the rooms, it would be even better.  Closing remarks: For the value we paid (Klook City Suite staycation for 4pax), I would return in a heartbeat! ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent service + great value for money staycation,

I decided to treat myself to a 3N staycation to celebrate a big birthday and could not have picked a better place to do so.  From the minute I arrived I was made to feel like a VIP by every member of the MO team.  Luxurious room with a bed so comfortable I was reluctant to get up each morning.  Great breakfast options each day although I did feel that the staff were very over stretched at times.

"We felt very welcomed at the hotel, only some incidents such as not being able to connect to the hotel wifi due to password given wrongly, but these are minor. The view is excellent and the room is very comfortable. ",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Homely stay,
"Kids enjoyed themselves at the pool- there is a small 0.37m deep wading pool for young kids, a shallow pool with in water pool loungers, and a 1.2-1.4m main pool. We had booked our pool slots few weeks prior to our stayca to avoid disappointment, so had no issues getting our slots. The famed MO bar is top notch, with a good selection of bar food to match the interesting cocktails. My favourite is the Milkyway - whiskey, oolong, brown sugar. The Sarimanok is insta-worthy - rum, mango, citrus.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Pool & MO bar were highlights,
"We are extremely satisfied with Mandarin Oriental's service. Right from the Check-in to the room, to the food to the Check-out, every touch point was seamless.

"People are the most important assets of any company. This is so much more true as the staff here at Mandarin Oriental was extremely helpful, graceful, courteous, and flexible.   I stayed here for 2 nights as a fan of MO. Despite the many Covid restrictions, during my stay, it did not felt any less enjoyable. In fact, it felt even more personalized.  Before my stay, I received an email from one of the staff to ask if there was anything I required for my stay.  On the day of my stay, I received a WhatsApp message to notify me of my room availability. Even the breakfast which was alar cart buffet style had very excellent service from the staff.  Overall stay was pleasant and I look forward to my next stay with them.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Awesome staff, awesome stay!",
"Everything was perfect from check in to check out. We had a City suite which is spacious and definitely very comfortable for a family of 4. They even added two complimentary extra beds for my two boys when I only expected 1 to be provided.  This is definitely greatly appreciated!  Suffice to say, we all had a good night sleep!  Pool reservation is for 2hr slot and is great as some hotels only offer an hour of swimming time. We had our dinner at the Melt cafe which was included in the booking. Food wise, nothing outstanding.  However, we received such impeccable service from Alex ( if I remembered the name correctly ) . Breakfast was delicious as compared to the dinner. Service was attentive and good too.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Absolutely Perfect Staycation!,
Booked the staycation to celebrate son's birthday since we are not able to travel during the Covid-19 period. A Big Thank you to the Guest relations team for their special arrangement.

Highly recommend!,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent family staycation,
"Love the little touches that the hotel have for our family. The little ones were surprised with mini bedroom slippers and handwritten note. We were also treated to a cake from the hotel for my boy's 5th birthday - a super delight for him.   What worked for us as parents was the detailed follow through the staff had for our package with Kidztopia, making sure our desired slot was secured in advance and giving us the tickets on arrival.   On the physical facilities, the hotel's suite is very spacious, making it comfortable for 2 adults and 2 children. Rollaway beds were set up in advance, making it hassle free for us.   Definitely a hotel we will look forward to returning to!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent choice for family staycation,
Celebrated my 5th year anniversary in Mandarin Oriental. The hotel staffs were kind enough to help us decorated the room and even provided a complimentary cake to help us celebrate.

"Stayed for 1N in a marina Bay room for a birthday celebration-- was given a complimentary slice of chocolate cake after check-in. We were able to check in early and the process was smooth. View from room was great. Had a relaxing time at one of the cabanas - good for lazing around even if one doesn't swim. Ala carte bkft at Melt was adequate though could have more variety.  The late check out the next day at 6 pm was great, plenty of time  to do nothing and just enjoy the ambience.  Love to have a other staycation at MO again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Relaxing Staycation ,
"I very much enjoyed my staycation at Mandarin Oriental. The room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and seaview. Happy with the bath tub and well appointed bathroom. The staff was friendly from the front desk, Melt Cafe, MO Bar, Cherry Garden and to the concierge/door man staff. Housekeeping was also efficient in getting items requested. Special mention to Andrews (I think) for checking the bill and making things right, Sun for lugging my luggage down the staircase to the car park, and Joy from Cherry Garden for the great and attentive service given during my lunch. No turn down service and air con was a bit weak - otherwise the stay was perfect. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Delightful staycation,
"Booked two nights' staycation to celebrate my birthday. Balloons and cake welcomed us in the room. Was also given coupons for free drinks which we used at the MO Bar. The package came with free 3-course dinner each night, which we upgraded to the buffet on the second night with a small top-up. Both dinners were very good. Service from the hotel staff was excellent throughout the stay. If there was one complaint, it would be that the beds are too soft, almost like floating on water beds.

"Booked a 3 day 2 nights staycation. Excellent stay. The staff made the stay a very memorable and pleasant,  Jessica at check-in was amazing. The breakfast team at Melts was great. I am sorry I forgot their names. The pool staff was friendly, thank you Carthik and team.   The room is very spacious and the view of the bay will leave you in awe.    The only downside is that the beds and pillows were too soft for our liking but we had great sleep nonetheless.   The close proximity to shopping malls and dine-in options are a great plus.  We would like to thank the entire staff of Mandarin Oriental Singapore for an amazing job. Well done!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Staycay at The Bay,

"good stay overall. able to meet the needs of the customers.   will say that the melt cafe needs to improve on the 3course dinner that was included in the package I purchased. freshness of the fish was not the best, as well as the quality of the beef. nonetheless it was a pleasant experience especially when it comes to the guest relations team.   thank you ",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Good stay,

Indeed perfect destination for a family staycation with spacious huge room with a perfect additional bed for my Son & a nice bathroom with bathtub.  The 2-3 minutes walk to Marina square can get you too kids zone and a quick bite at the subway. The hotel pool is set up amazing for a nice swim relaxation in tents while the kid can continue playing in the small river type pool.  Best was since i was looking for halal options they offered a continental breakfast option that made our staycation complete as we did not have to worry on what should we opt for breakfast. Loved our stay !!,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Staycation with family,
"There was a short queue during check-in time but it moved quickly and we were in our room in less than 10 minutes. Stayed 1 night at the Marina Bay View Room on the 13th floor and it boasted a panoramic view of Marina Bay in all its glory. The room was clean and had the usual amenities - coffee, tea, kettle and the bathroom also had bath salts.  Our package included breakfast and a 3-course dinner - both meals were at Melt. Service was wonderful and we enjoyed both dinner and breakfast (ala carte buffet) very much.  Tip: Due to Covid 19, if you are coming from Marina Square, you have to exit via the door near Pororo Park.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Wonderful staycation,
"We had an enjoyable time in MO hotel as all the staff, from front desk to dining to room service were all very warm and welcoming during our stay. It feels like returning home everytime i got back to the hotel after a day out. Also love how personalize the service has been where they leave handwritten notes and decoration when they know that it is a special occassion for us.

"We booked the staycation package that includes entry to Kiztopia and everything was smooth from reservations till our check out. The selection at breakfast was great, a good mix of western and eastern dishes. The staff was kind enough to also advise us on the more Muslim-friendly options from the breakfast menu.  The cherry on top would definitely be the swimming pool ;) It's the largest we've been to (in our staycation experience in Singapore) and suited our 4 year old really well, it was a challenge to get her out after our 2-hour slot was up.  This was our first experience at Mandarin Oriental and definitely will not be our last. Coming back soon, wait for us Mandarin Oriental! This time we'll be sure to book a room facing the ocean/bay.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great weekend of fun and play!,
"The 3D2N staycation @ Mandarin Oriental was fantastic due to its location, friendly staff and most of all, the view. I had the Marina Bay view and it overlooked MBS all the way with a panorama view till Fullerton.  What i did not like: - Cot provided was way too low to put my child (4 months) into. When asked for a rollaway bed, it was not available. - Carpark was most troublesome as it was not within the hotel and worst, there is no lift, which is most inconvenient for those with prams. However, one of the staff there happened to cross path and insisted on helping us carry all the way down. Kudos to him!   Despite the above, it was still a very wonderful stay and would definitely be back!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Refreshing getaway with a wonderful view,
"We booked a hotel room to celebrate son's birthday. The hotel knows about it and was given early check in and late check out. They also put personalised birthday balloons on the bed and a birthday cake on the table as well. The hotel staff also took a photo of us and developed the photo pasted in a birthday card.   I have stayed in many hotels in Singapore and this hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed. Beside making my son very happy for his birthday, they have a very big bed and toilet with bathtub. The view was superb and was facing the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands!  Will definitely go there again for staycation and recommend to my famiy and friends.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Attentive to details and staff is caring!,

Had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Initially booked a staycation promotion. Hotel contacted me later to inform me a better 10.10 offer and asked if i would like to change. Celebrated my wife birthday and request for rose petals on bed. This was done beautifully and received complimentary cake and balloons as well. Room was in high floor with balcony.  Was pleasantly surprised as we could check-in 12 + noon. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Make sure you request for complimentary car parking as it will cost $50++ for 2 days parking. Room came dinner but was not impressed with the main course.  Overall every satisfy with stay.,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Staycation birthday celebrations ,
"It was my first time staying with Mandarin Oriental, as a local Singaporean I have always heard great things about the hotel but never had the privilege of staying with the hotel until now.   1. The rooms were clean and spacious (I enjoyed a free upgrade to the Marina Bay view Deluxe King Room via the Klook deal).   2. Very personalized customer service, it was my birthday celebration and they prepared balloons and cakes with personalized messages (handwritten) -  very endearing.   3. Check in/out was seamless and fast. Food at the hotel was great, with huge portions and great variety.   4. Free parking and every one I met was polite and welcoming.

Brought my parents along for a staycation with my 3yr old boy at mandarin oriental and we enjoyed the experience. The staff were attentive and my boy enjoyed the trip tremendously as he was so pleased with the birthday balloons they had placed on the bed with his name written on it as well. He is so happy that he has his own fuzzy kids size mandarin oriental slippers as well which is a lovely touch by the hotel to pay attention to their little guests as well. Enjoyed the meals at the hotel and the cocktails at MO bar are good too. The only issue is to try to ask for a better view room next time as they did not mention that there was no view at all (mainly rooftop of suntec city) even though I requested for a high floor room with a view. Otherwise a lovely staycation for families.,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Lovely staycation,

I actually preferred the breakfast (non-buffet style) since now they come to your table to take your order, and everything is made a la minute and served to you. We don't need to walk around anymore. Pool timings are in 2 hour slots which is more than enough time for a poolside cocktail and a dip and a short nap. Also had a nice discount since most hotels are vying for patrons to return.

"MO Rooms are not fantastic if you compare to modern hotels but one of the key factors to hotel excellence is their services and MO did exceptionally well. They literally service you from the moment you reach their doorstep. We had a training-duty-manager, Bobby, that checked us in. He was polite, cheerful and insightful where he guides you through the whole process from documentation, recommendations and directions. Moreover, we casually asked about wedding setups and he immediately pulled out MO and his own contacts for us, walking us through MO's offerings. In short, I remember MO because of Bobby's service excellence.

Everything from the exclusive check-in experience, guest room design and amenities, welcome gifts, club lounge, bar and the limousine services were exceptional. We will not be able to stay in any another hotel when we visit Singapore again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Easily one of the best stays ever!!!,
From the moment we were greeted in reception to our departure everything was perfect. Our room was stunning and had a wonderful view of the marina. The highlight for us was the Afternoon Tea which is the best we have ever had. A set price and you can have as much as you like. They will replace a dish if you want more! Chocolate scones were amazing. Pool area is beautiful and totally relaxing. You are greeted with a cool refreshing drink and towel. The gym was air conditioned and had the largest equipment and instructor near by if needed. The service throughout the hotel is outstanding. Highly recommend and we would most definitely return. ,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Exceptional ,
"As we didn't manage to book Marina Bay Sands because it was fully booked, we went to this hotel. We were looking for perfect location to enjoy and look around. Hotel is at 5 minute walk to Marina, Gardens by the bay etc. You can also get nice Marina and gardens view from your room. Pool area is quite small, but really nice and enjoyable, hotel staff is realy friendly and courteous. Room was spaceous and nice, perfectly cleaned every day. Would definitely return again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great hotel with perfect location!,
"Superb view for National Day fireworks @ the Marina reserve facing room. The hotel is located at a very strategic position, for almost all fireworks that happen around the Marina Bay Area, as there are other rooms facing the different positions.   One of the items that I hope the hotel can improve on, will be the internet connection. During this stay, that does not seems to wow as an end user. Other than that, the rest are great ! Including the food at the restaurant (cherry garden) and MO bar.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Staycation during National Day week,
"1.shower room too small even for an average size Asian.  If your body size is anything larger than that,  then good luck to you.  You won't be able to maneuver around.   2. Bed is too soft. People with back problem or not used to soft bed shouldn't stay in this hotel.  The bed just sink down when you lie on it.  It doesn't provide adequate support for your proper sleeping posture.   3. They don't provide sufficient food options for vegetarians.",2.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Not worth the price tag,
"there is a lot to like about the MO - the pool is one of the nicest spots in Singapore, its central to most things, and the food is all excellent, with good choices in the hotel, and 2 malls right next door with cheaper food options.  but the customer service is just exceptional - nothing is too much trouble, the staff (somehow) seem to know your name on the 2nd day there, and really do look after you.  TOP TIP - join the MO member program (for free) and get freebies to make your stay better.    One of my favorite places to stay in the world, and not pretty reasonably priced for what you get.  ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"just wow - world class service, great location, all round just great",
Frequented this hotel. They have clean facilities. And cheerful concierge staff. Willing to assist. Keep it up! No wonder it's rated 5 star by Forbes! Located accessible at the heart of the city.  Highly recommended hotel in Singapore!  ,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Facilties,
"I have decided to celebrate our 29 Wedding Anniversary with Mandarin Oriental, Singapore. Amazed by the services, special thanks to Shermaine from the sales team and Donnell Tormon (Mhelo) Supervisor Poolside.   When we check-in, we were given a complimentary upgrade to Ocean View along with a surprising welcome card from my daughter, anniversary cake, red wine and fresh fruits  (Room 2037).   In the morning, we had our breakfast at Melt Cafe, the staff gave us a complimentary anniversary cake & when we went for an afternoon swim, Mhelo gave us complimentary drinks and anniversary cake as well (Poolside).  We are well taken care of, excellent services and highly recommend.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Wedding Anniversary Staycay,
"Staff there are helpful and friendly. Specifically, I would like to give a shout out to lounge club -  taking care of me every moment, giving a little personalized surprise on my birthday, advising me places to visit with care and patience.    Personally, I value service and staff the most. This is perhaps the best experience I had. Words could not explain much, but what I can say is - I feel like home. I would definitely come and visit mandarin oriental again. This is a hotel I strongly recommend to everyone considering where to stay in Singapore.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent service!,
"We had a great stay and were warmly welcomed. The kids each had a surprise package that they thoroughly enjoyed.  Beds were comfy, food was great at the restaurants and the location was good for us with 3 small children and walking everywhere. The pool also suited the kids with a shallow section right infront of the beds where we could enjoy a drink and keep an eye on them.  The drinks and food are a expensive but seem to be in check with most upmarket prices in Singapore.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Quick stopover during Covid-19 outbreak,
"We stayed here for two nights ahead of joining our cruise. The Bay View rooms are large, well appointed and very comfortable. The view from the windows overlooking the bay is magnificent particularly at night when the lighting of the Marina Bay Sands hotel to the side and the distant Gardens By The Bay change. The staff are attentive, polite and very helpful. The food is excellent particularly the breakfasts and afternoon tea and cocktails were included in the afternoon. A most enjoyable stay and certainly somewhere we will stay again and highly recommend.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Impressive,
"The stay in MO was immaculate. Me and SO spent a single night at the ocean view room and never looked back. We've since decided to make it a yearly tradition and spend our anniversary at MO from now!  The room was exceptionally clean and comfortable. Everything, every angle, everyone was on point.  The staff we encountered at every corner of the hotel were so pleasant. Every single staff we met were going beyond the required and made us as relaxed and as comfortable as possible.   Staying in the ocean view room is a must. The view, day and night were spectacular. Waking up to this view makes my heart sing a happy sigh.  Special shout out to Ian and Midori from guest relations for making our stay memorable.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Splendid. Memorable. Best decision ever,
"From the moment you arrive you are looked after as an honoured guest. We had a Bay view room on the 15th floor and the floor to ceiling window the width of the room takes your breath away. We had a light supper in the cafe by the pool and the food was really nice and came with a complimentary drink -Singapore Sling which was a nice touch.  Breakfast was in the Melt cafe, which had a very impressive choice and the omelette made to order was excellent.  We also took a lovely afternoon tea in the bar and it was beautifully done with an Easter theme.  Also must mention the Fan of the MO Sidecar experience with Simon, which was great fun. Not the most comfortable ride - but a really memorable experience none the less.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Grand Hotel in a great location,

"Welcomed by warm and smiley MO colleagues throughout the whole 3days stay, not forgetting the approachable staffs always readily to attend closely to our needs and requests.

"3 of us stayed 8 nights at the hotel. The best asset of this hotel was the staff. They were all so friendly. Here are the names of a few people who made our stay extra special (at Breakfast : Nancy, Ganesan and CK, the lady who cooked the waffles and the lady who cooked the dim sums. In the club lounge : Louis, Elle, Xui Fang, Rio). The food at breakfast and in the lounge was delicious.  Why I gave 4.5 and not 5 : The corridors are dated (new carpet and wallpaper are needed).  We complained about a flickering light and the toilet (the water did not stop running after we flushed)  but it never got sorted out. We stayed in room 1827 Apart from that, we had a great time, the location was very good and we would definitely consider coming back if in Singapore",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Should be 4.5,

Whenever I stay I always stay at the MO, and have now for the best part of a decade, as the hotel is consistently amazing, from the moment you arrive nothing seems to be too much trouble for the team there.  Also a great selection of bars, restaurants, and a great gym and epic pool to relax by.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,The MO Singapore continues to be the place to stay,
In most ways this is a top class hotel but it falls down on its rules for smoking in public places. The Pool bar serves food and drinks AND also allows people to smoke which is appalling. Non smokers are confined to a few meagre tables under the eaves of a nearby building . Nowhere else in the world would this happen in a 5 star hotel! Non smokers are given minority status where smokers are allowed a free hand.  As a world wide traveller I Have never experienced anything like this before and would never visit Singapore again without checking this issue of smokers dominating public eating areas!,2.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"If you are a non smoker don’t visit this hotel,",
"Staying in the club lounge we were presented with a superb level of care by a team lead by Andrew , Matt and Elle. The rooms very comfortable , whilst the lounge , with high ceilings and lovely furnishings was an oasis from the humidity outside. The staff constantly  checked to see if you were fine in an unobtrusive way, whilst no request seemed to trouble them. We had previously been to the Marina Bay Sands a few times , but felt that the mandarin oriental was able to provide a more personal , less crowded service. This will certainly be our home when in Singapore going forward . Thanks you",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Beautiful,
Lovely hotel and well managed. Great location but only let me down on 1) breakfast quality and 2) a ridiculous system of no credit for being a Fan of Mandarin Oriental member because my secretary booked and paid  on Expedia as they forbid credits to accumulate if paid via a 3rd party....I would easily visit again but might need to sort out some kinks...,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Short efficient biz trip,
"First time in Singapore but not our first time staying at a Mandarin Oriental and I got to say the service was excellent as always, the attention to detail is incredible we always had drinking water and fresh fruit in our room. The service at the lounge always amazing the staff knows how to make you feel at home. Thanks to Andrew, Jaya, Princes, Rio, Elle, Nicky, Xin Fang & Matthew. We had a great time in an amazing and unique city and we also got to celebrate lunar new year. Hope to go back soon!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,In love with Singapore ,
"We stayed 5 nights for a business trip but actually Mandarin Oriental and their staff made it feel like vacation. From check-in to check-out, the people of MO really made the difference.  Always greeted by name we felt special throughout the day. No question, rooms and public areas are well kept, elegant and still cosy. And while other hotels in Singapore always feel busy, it feels calm and relaxed whenever entering MO.  The pool area is just the best, perfect Bay and Skyline views, great landscape and service. Whenever coming back to Singapore, MO is the place to stay.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Best hotel ever,
"This Mandarin Oriental Hotel is not up to the standards of others in the hotel chain where  I have stayed in the past.

"Stayed at the MO for a few days before heading to the Maldives. Wonderful location close to the gardens, shopping and restaurants. Enjoyed the 'Mother of Dragons' cocktail at the Mo Bar and the pool overlooking the bay. The only negatives was that this is a conference hotel, so many people staying here for work conferences. Also, requested early check in as we traveled over 23 hours from LA and was not able to check in early.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great hotel in the heart of Singapore,
Excellent welcome and staff from and club level were extremely courteous. They accommodated my checkout for 830 pm with a small fee.   I really appreciated that since my flight was at 1150 pm.   Mandarin oriental has lived up to its distinctive service and looking forward to my other stays at MO.  Location was excellent  I walked to China town/ lau pat/ Mustafa center/ bugis/little India/hajj.   It was a great calorie burner. Did it all comfortably in 2 days   3rd day was sentosa island.  Safe thanks to the strict laws.   Even the two guys I saw in a rare sight sleeping under stairs asked if I needed help with directions.....real help not shady help...lol,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Transit for 4 days quick Singapore tour on foot.,
We visited the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights in January 2020 and stayed in a Club room on the 21st floor overlooking the Marina Bay.  Our room had a stunning view across the bay and was very comfortable and well appointed.  The Club lounge facilities were excellent and we made good use of the refreshments available.  All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very well located to visit many of the tourist sights and shops with easy taxi availability to reach those not within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again when returning to Singapore,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,A taste of luxury at the heart of the city,

Spacious rooms, a couple of bars and restaurants and a very helpful staff in every department.  everything one could need is found in a fully equipped room, including WIFI.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,A great Stay in a Great City,
Stayed here with the family. As always great service. Lovely pool area if a bit small. Expensive poolside menu (1 bottled beer S$22)  Melt cafe is amazing. Check in process is very slow. Was supposed to have a room upgrade (as part of the Amex Centurion) but for the second time only had a standard room without a view ( the hotel is triangle shaped with 2 sections experiencing good views) Still a great place for a break with the family. Location is also awesome. ,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Pleasant family holiday ,
"What a nice way to start our vacation being greeted by the friendly staff from the knowledgeable doorman to bell to smiling Charissa who delightfully surprised us with a Resting room while our actual room is being prepared.  How thoughtful of her as we are exhausted from our overnight  flight. Can't wait to see our room when our resting room overlooks the pool, the Eye and the Skypark.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Friendly Indulgences,
We choose MO because of a wonderful Christmas we spend at MO in Bangkok. The hotel in Singapore seems a bit outdated and very dark. The pool area is nice and the fitness center is good. The rest is without charm. Feels like staying on a large convention hotel - I will not recommend it for leisure and families. What they served in the club lounge was very nice. The MELT restaurant was very dark and very big. ,3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Not what we hoped for,
"We had a fabulous stay at Mandarin Oriental hotel - Singapore. The room was clean, beds were excellent, and the service was perfect. We had the Club Lounge benefit, the afternoon the was nice. We did get good guidance regarding to different daytrips around Singapore. The guidance tips made our stay fabulous even dough it was raining every day. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Best ever!,
"You can't go wrong with any MO property with top notch accommodations and service. However, the hotel does get busy and may not be the best options for those looking for a quite sanctuary from the city. The front desk informed us about a convention taking place at the hotel and upgraded us as result. The gesture was sweet but the all the facilities at the hotel were packed (breakfast, gym, pool), which made the trip not as enjoyable. Will definitely go back in the future but will ask if there is an event taking place before I do.",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Beautiful hotel in a convenient location, can be noisy/busy",
"We spent 5 days, 4 nights in Singapore and during the period of the Singapore Marathon. Upgraded to Club Room with Marina view, we enjoyed the room and the Club level. Nice to have the benefit of having breakfast at the Club or in the buffet restaurant and to have dinner if you choose not to dine outside. A centrally located hotel where you feel like you've still have room to breathe, in an urban setting with a beautiful pool and views of the Marina make this a spectacular place to stay.   I enjoyed every minute of our stay, the service is excellent, food and drinks were great! ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,I'm headed back to MO Singapore as soon as possible again!,

"To sum it up, it has seen better days. Rooms need refurbishment, our room was very dusty, smell of cigarette (non smoking) bags took 45 min to get delivered to our room and that was after two phone calls. They wanted us to upgrade to club, perhaps we should have?Unfortantly Mandarin Oriental does not live up to their strong trademark so far. Recommend to choose 4S or RC if you have high standards.

Hospitality is an art form which is difficult to master to perfection. The whole ""orchestra was playing a beautiful concert"" consistent and are all very talented. Employees smiling, confident, friendly and very helpful and the quality of the guest experience is very high. All under the leadership and direction of a the hospitality veteran Mr. Christian A Hassing and his well educated and polite team of employees and managers. Thank You. I will be back.

"Situated next to one mall and opposite the Esplande, the hotel is well placed but not in perhaps the best position in Singapore.  It is only 800m to the nearest station though.  The breakfast is first class and the rooms are comfortable without being oppulent.  Generally the service was very good although room cleaning was very late some days (nearly 4pm one day).  However, the design of the hotel is not great.  The central atrium echos and on a couple of nights the noise from downstairs made it difficult to sleep.  This dated design and the somewhat dated feel to the rooms mean for me that this is a very good but not great hotel",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Very good hotel but a little dated,
"We had an amazing stay here! Fantastic facilities (the swimming pool is a must) and a gorgeous room that you wished you could stay longer. We strongly recommend to include breakfast, as it is amazing - we particularly enjoyed the local delights.

An absolute joy of a stay and would happily recommend to anyone.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fantastic stay!,

My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and have to say it is a fantastic hotel. The facilities and location are excellent but it is the staff that made our trip a truly wonderful experience.

This place costs a pretty penny and I've been here twice already. That alone should speak volumes of the place. The room and the amenities is immaculate. You're spoilt for choice at the buffet breakfast at Melt . The bar comes with some fabulous cocktails too. Service was not consistently good but I'll let it slide since they tried to make up for it. Appreciate the effort. ,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Grand views of Marina Bay Sands and the vicinity,

At the beginning, I was a bot angry because there was nobody to pick up our bags, but after I mentioned this, the staff made more than up for it and I think it was just a misunderstanding. The room (suite) was very comfortable, spacious, clean and well equipped. The Club Lounge is comfortable and staff are very attentive and try to anticipate the guests wishes. I loved going to the lounge because it is luxurious but not too pretentious. I will come again. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Great, luxurious experience",

From extending our Day Room use by an hour for no extra charge to honouring our room request (and giving us a great view of the Marina Bay!), it felt like we were really being looked after.   Pool, gym, bar staff all amazing. I would be happy to stay here again.   Only one downside - the Cherry Garden restaurant was disappointing. Service was slow and inefficient and the menu not very inspiring. However they were very sweet and gave us a free dessert, and fortunately, it did not mare the experience of the rest of the hotel.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Tranquil Luxury,
"This is a very good hotel where I have now stayed twice on business. The location is fantastic, just across the water. Excellent for running (if the heat allows!). I particularly liked the breakfast, which has an excellent selection of different type of food and offers the option of eating outdoor.   The swimming pool is beautiful, large and with plenty of sun chairs. The view is spectacular.   Staff is very kind and professional, as expected from a MO hotel.   My only negative comment is that the structure is getting quite tired and might be in need of renovation.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fantastic breakfast,

The location of the hotel, the view from our room and from the swimming pool, the unique open air fitness and yoga place, the bath amenities from atelier Cologne, the amazing Dim Sum brunch at the Cherry Garden restaurant and the lunches at the Italian restaurant were absolutely perfect!

"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a terrific time. We had a corner Ocean/Marina Bay view Club room on the 21st (top) floor. It had its own balcony with a great view of the bay, Ferris wheel, MB Sands etc. The hotel was one of the best we have stayed in with the staff so helpful and friendly. We in particular enjoyed the Oriental Club which our room granted us access to; the breakfast and afternoon tea in there were really good and the pre dinner champagne and cocktails a great way to kick off the evening. The pool area was also a great way to cool off after a day of exploring. Would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again in the not too distant future.

"Arrived 1600 Hours and the room is not ready. Me and my siblings the 3 of us inside the room with all amenities sets for 2pax. I thought they have ample time regarding it but Housekeeping manage to come by at 1730 Hours to solve the issue. Found previous guest items (chocolates) inside the drawer. The kettle jug has water inside, when calling the Operator, she state it is normal practice of them to put water inside. I find that hard to believe as for hygienic issues. Breakfast was great. Frontman Concierge and Receptionist are humble and welcoming. Aside to that, I hope MO improves more.

What a great service and first impression. We were fortunate enough to have a room with direct amazing view to the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer. The night view was superb. The house keeping was fantastic, besides the daily house keeping, every evening our room was made ready for the night, lights dimmed and etc. The buffet breakfast was fantastic, with wide spread of Asian, Chinese, Malay, Indian, and western food.   Truly one of the best hotel and holiday experiences we had so far.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Excellent service and beautiful view,
"I used to be a fan of this hotel but years have gone by seemingly without any investment and it shows. The room looked tired and in need of a refurbishment. Light switches falling off, wardrobe doors not closing, uneven aircon, mediocre cleanliness - not what I expect from a 5 star establishment. Staff are superbly professional and courteous but I will avoid this MO until the property has undergone a refurb. For the prices charged by the MO, there are now several better options in town.

We had buffet dinner one one and It was magnificent. Aside from local dishes there was plenty of shrimp and lobster.  The buffet was pricey but definitely worth it.

The hotel is in a good location has great views from its hotel  I almost upgraded my room to a marina bay view suite, however when I was in it, it was pokey and just tired and it would have another $200+ usd per night.

They even offered to let us have breakfast and use the pool while waiting, and recommended a few spots in the vicinity where we could explore, all while being really attentive and helpful. Check in time is in the afternoon but our room was sorted by 10am. The room was clean, spacious and cozy. There were complimentary chocolates and seasonal fruit as well. We were taken very good care of and it was a very enjoyable stay here. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Impeccable service,
"We had two short stays at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore and loved both of them. We stayed in a club room which was large and had a great view over the Marina. The executive club itself is very relaxing and being able to stop in there anytime from breakfast to late means you don't just have to sit in your room.

After looking over the room I had to go back to the front desk and see if they could help, after a few minutes they were able to find something on the 20th floor with much better views and a nicer room, this was great.

They advised me one night that the meal I had ordered had seafood in it and I shouldn't eat it. This is superb service.

Started a trip to SE Asia with a few days in Singapore. The feel of the city is reflected in this hotel. Large and efficient and ultimately set apart by the service and desire to accommodate. Our family was put in one of the signature 2 bedroom suites and after a 17 hour flight from Los Angeles the elegance and comfort restored us quickly.   The hotel should be proud of its staff top to bottom. This is a pretty big hotel and handles large groups but they do it comfortably and delivered a personalized 5 star experience.

Stayed in a club room- big mistake and waste of money!  The food in the club lounge was really terrible- especially all the cooked food was surprisingly bad- and the decor and vibe uninspiring.

Kudos to the front team, especially Dayana and Xinyi.   Got upgraded to a Marina view on top floor where my kid can see the MBS compound very nicely.   Rooms are clean and perfect. Not sure why other guests complained about age and tear.  My parents room got further upgraded to a Suite.  Room quality is better and newer than Conrad Senetor Suite nearby (2801) I would recommend especially if you have FHR access.   TIPS: City View is not really a view and it makes a big difference for us for the view alone. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Family trip made better,
In my opinion Mandarin Oriental Singapore has the best location in Singapore - the view of Marina Bay and ability to walk to Marina Bay Sands Shoppers and Fullerton Bay Hotel area within a 10 minutes each place is very valuable. Also Mandarin  Oriental has one of the beautiful swimming pool's area I've ever seen. Just one downside that we were not able to fully enjoy the swimming pool due to the huge number of little babies with their parents and their inflatable gadgets inside the pool. Dolce Vita bar with it's wonderful view - was the cherry on top of out stay. ,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Amazing hotel,
"You cannot fault the Mandarins Staff, their care, attention to detail,  their warmth and humanity was outstanding. Location is excellent for both Shopping and Sightseeing.

"We have now gone back to the mandarin Oriental for the second time to spend our wedding anniversary there as Singapore is our favourite city and this hotel probably the best we have ever stayed in.  The location is wonderful with views over Marina Bay if you choose the right room and the iconic business district and Mandarin Sands building.  The food is excellent with the hotels buffet one of the best we have ever had especially the seafood section, but what makes it stand out for us is the amazing staff they have. Charming, Polite, Helpful, quite simply the best service of any hotel of anywhere we have stayed in Singapore or anywhere for that matter.  We like it so much that we are already planning out next trip.  We would both highly recommend this hotel",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Simply The Best,
The hotel is luxurious enough in a great location with excellent pool. Rooms are slightly dated and overall feel is not very individual and service levels for Asia are a little on the low side. Charging for Wifi also doesn't seem expected in a hotel of this order.,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Mass Processed luxury,
"Spent the weekend back in January.  Reserved with AMEX fine hotels, so we got an early check-in, room upgrade, breakfast and dinner in the rate paid. The hotel is well located, very pretty with a very attentive staff.  Room was perfect with a panoramic view of the Marina Sands Hotel.  Food and Beverage was also very good. Will repeat if I need to be in the area [as opposed to the Orchard Road/Blvd area].",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Very Nice Stay,
"Stayed three nights at the MO Singapore in April 2019. We had stayed there three years ago, liked it and chose it again. Its left a greater impression on my wife and I this time around.   All hotels at this level are clean, have nice rooms, have great facilities and so on. I think it was the little touches from all the staff we encountered that made the difference between good and great. Just one small example that we really liked was a little velcro cable-tidy put onto our iPhone chargers by the cleaner! Never had that before. Also, Lisa in the MO Bar served us a few times and treated us like royalty. Thank you.  A true test is whether you'll stay in the same hotel again. When we're next in Singapore we absolutely will.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,We came back for more!,
just returned form a weekend in the hotel. On the first night i woke up and side of my body was covered in ichy red rash and bites. After googling it looks like mite bites. I told the hotel and they changed the sheets but thats it. I worried that all my stuff is infested now and can't stop scratching!,3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Got bitten by mites in the bed!,
"My wife and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, over the Easter holidays. We were there with our daughter and our grandchildren.  A nice hotel with very friendly staff, excellent facilities and very good dining. My only issue for us was not the best of locations. It was typically hot and humid as Singapore usually is, which made the walk to the MRT or to Gardens by the Bay quite stressful for the little ones.  On the positive, they loved the excellent swimming pool and we spend a lot of time there.   The rooms were large and well equipped with ample dining options, including a very good breakfast buffet.   For us the highlight was the lovely staff and their friendly banter, which was both amusing and endearing.  We had a great time.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Mandarin Oriental, a nice hotel, but not the best location",
"Had wanted to stay for a few years but always chose something else.  KNow now why. Expensive in every way for the value it provides. STaff lovely but such limited English is disappointing esp with check in desk. Clean and acceptable but not exciting. Best part is pool area - service is lovely but very, very slow.  Restaurants super expensive as is airport transfer. ",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Disappointing,
"My wife and I stayed here over the weekend. The staff (from the porter, front desk and restaurant staff)  were great and I can't thank you enough for being so welcoming, accommodating and helpful. Food was great as well. Really appreciate it. Would love to visit again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Enjoyable stay,
"Returned to SG for business. Sid and Ma Lou, who work at the pool and Melt Cafe respectively, were again very courteous and helpful. Rooms are still dated, in need of a renovation. No pot of tea or flowers awaiting me in my room upon check in this time, however; maybe it is because I was not staying in a suite? ",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Second visit,
"When in Singapore I would not consider staying anywhere else. It is ideally situated in Marina Bay within walking distance of Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Raffles, The Singapore Flyer, Boat and Clarke Quays, Chinatown, Fort Canning Park and more. Staff are always attentive and efficient. The hotel is well run and bedrooms are spacious and have good views",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Up to usual high standard,
"The Mandarin Oriental was our first choice because of location.  Being a Platinum Ax member our room was waiting when we arriv d at 9:30 am and up graded to a fabulous water view.  The room was well appointed, luxury linens and a beautiful Marble bathroom.   The staff was outstanding with whatever our needs were.  The buffets in the Melt Cafe, like none we had ever seen before.   This hotel is a big winner with us...",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fabulous hotel in Singapore,
"A little disappointed as I expected more from the MO brand. The lobby is dated, dark & depressing. Service from front desk and lobby staff was pretty 50-50, with about half enthusiastic & friendly, and the other half pretty nonchalant.  Rooms and washroom are spacious and clean, but again a bit dated and a little dusty.  Cross the street from the hotel entrance and you're right at Glutton's Bay and the Esplanade waterfront. You're also just a short walk to the Double Helix Bridge which connects to Marina Bay Sands. There's a direct mall connection to Marina Square but its a mall past its prime. Walk through Marina Square to get to better malls like Millennia Walk, Suntec City and Raffles Place.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"More suitable for business, better options for leisure stays",
"Elderly hotel in need of a dire upgrade compensated by friendly staff who try hard. Nice pool area except the day I was there was ruined by 6 drunk Australian men having a very loud, rude lads lunch with complete disregard for other guests. I felt the management should have really been more proactive and dealt with it. ",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fair experience,
"The staff at this hotel could not be friendlier or more helpful.  The service at the reception desk, concierge, round the pool, and at breakfast were excellent.  The location is perfect as you can reach the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Mall/Restaurants by foot, as well as the Gardens By the Bay.  The rooms could do with a little updating, but they are quiet and comfortable. the swimming pool area is really lovely, with plenty of sun beds and a fabulous pool.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Superb Hotel, Superb Service",
"My initial impression of the MO Singapore was a little disappointing. I arrived late and jumped in the shower, which was disappointingly weedy. I guess that isn't surprising when the water is imported / desalinated but still this was particularly disappointing having come from the MO in HK which I think has the best showers in the world.  However, things looked up from there. The pool area is lovely - not too busy, great views. The gym is good too. Breakfast was excellent - lots of choice, fresh juices.   Location was good - easy to the business area, shopping malls / Suntec etc behind. Overall a very pleasant stay. I would stay again.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Excellent food, perfect service",
"Spent 4 nights at the Ocean View room.  Facilities as expected was great! The pool is amazing and breakfast was decent.  However, for the premium price paid, the service level was lacking - ie. no turn down service.   Other 5 star hotels definitely provide that extra hospitality which makes it a 5 star hotel.

"We got complementary stay at Mandarin Oriental for 1 night stay. The room spacious, view Marina Bay Sand is perfect! Huge pool !!  Breakfast? Amazing!! They did very well on the service. Pretty large of selection of breakfast buffet, and this is the biggest buffet breakfast ever we had try among hotel that we have stayed. We had Nasi Lemak menu from the breakfast at the Hotel, and perfectly nice ever !! Me & partner was honoured to stayed at the 5 star hotel.  Thanks you for the marvellous service!",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,AWESOME & AMAZING !!!,
"I stayed here for a night. I was booked into a Club room and then upgraded to a Club Suite. I could have quite happily stayed here forever!   The Club Lounge is great. Free champagne and afternoon tea and other fresh snacks depending on the time of day.   We had breakfast in the main dining area as apparently it had better choice than the Club room. It was HUGE and very busy but had an amazing selection of breakfast food from all around the world. Service for fresh coffee orders was very slow and the waiting staff seemed overwhelmed. I had pancakes and then went back for bacon, eggs and hash browns.   The customer service here is excellent, the staff are very well trained. ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,I didn’t want to go home! ,
"We upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a better view of the bay. The carpet was slightly warn around the entrance to the room, the wallpaper was damaged in places, Generally in need of refurbishment. Breakfast was good with a great selection of food, but layout of food was spread over a wide area and slightly confusing. Excellent WiFi but not included in the cost without being a Fan. Next door to the Marina Mall (outdated). Sun-tech mall (more modern) few minutes walk through the Marina Mall without going outside (handy when torrential rain starts)!! All routes for the hop-on, hop-off bus are on the far side of the Sun-tech mall (10 minutes walk from hotel). Our stay was OK but not exceptional.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Showing its age,

A lovely suite with an ample living room and separate bedroom.  It's quite nice to have two large room in a suite rather than having either two small rooms and calling it a suite or one much larger than the other.  There is desk space for those who need to work.  The hotel has the Cherry Garden for guests wishing to have dim sum plus many alternatives for those wishing to have a mix of foods.  ,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great service,
This review relates to a short stopover in Singapore.  We arrived very early in the morning so had booked our room for the night before in order to be able to go straight to our room after a long haul flight.  The check in staff were friendly and welcoming and the room an oasis of peace and comfort. All facilities were of top quality and the freshness and cleanliness were appreciated. The pool was accessible and had a good range of loungers and cabanas with attendants on hand to ensure that fresh towels and beverages were always available and also to manage the turnover of the loungers.  We ate a very delicious meal at the Dolce Vita restaurant on level 5.  Great atmosphere and delicious food.,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Remarkable for the helpfulness of staff throughout the hotel,
"Again I stayed at the MO SIN as usually every two years foe a long time. I had a German VIP Group with (as nearly always) and we were 10 people altogether. As usually I booked the Oriental Club Lounge, a must for the distinctive traveller. The MO is always very busy but you get fantastic service in the Lounge with high quality food and drinks. The service is unbeatable though sometimes the Lounge is quite crowded. Nevertheless I am convinced its the best place to stay in SIN. Thanks to everybody, especially the Ladies at the Lounge desk and Yaja in service, he is an institution. A wonderful Pool area, a Italian restaurant by the pool and excellent Restaurants all over the Hotel convince to stay.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,outstanding and excellent as always,
"From the moment you are greeted by the man in the red coat you are getting the 5 star treatment. The reception is spacious, welcoming and efficient and although we were early booking in we were not kept waiting unnecessarily as our room became available. The choice of where to eat is wide though we limited ourselves to the Melt Cafe and Dolce Vita. The former provided an excellent and generous lunch in delightful surroundings adjacent to the pool area. The latter provided a bewildering choice at Breakfast and in the evening. Special mention must be made of the chef who took a personal interest in ensuring my wife Gluten Free requirement was taken seriously. Our late check out request was dealt with courteously and to our satisfaction. Highly recommended.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Top Hotel,
"The arrival itself was nice and the check in was quick and efficient. The room was excellent and clean without any remarks. The service at the restaurant during the breakfast was tragic and I spent a lot of time for the simplest orders. Also, the evening meal was the same problem. The hotel is pleasant and in a beautiful place but disappointed with the service and I did not get what I paid. Unfortunately wasted money for dinner.",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Disappointed with food/drink services,
"Everyone we interacted with was incredibly kind and professional here. We were so impressed by the level if attention to our needs. At Melt, Chef Jeffery paid such special attention to my husband's dairy allergy! He walked him through each buffet station to let him know what he could and couldn't eat. Alex the Assistant Manager was also amazing. Excellent service and food! We loved our experience. Also, all of the desserts blew my mind. Lastly, we told them upon check-in that we were on our honeymoon and they sent up a bottle of wine and special cake for us. Not to mention, the turn down service was so thoughtful and meticulous. Hat's off to the housekeeping staff! Thanks for everything! ",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Incredible Service!,
"The bed is comfortable, the room is spacious and the hotel is in walking distance to great shopping. That being said, the breakfast, although vast in it's offerings, lacked in quality and I ordered room service where the food was simply awful. I didn't think fish and chips could be so poorly done, but I was wrong. In addition, the prices listed on the menu were actually double once I checked out, not just for me, but for my friend who was also staying there. I was put on the 7th floor with a window facing the pool and all the pool guests facing my room. I felt extremely uncomfortable opening my window while walking around the room without being fully clothed. I understand that Singapore is expensive, but with great quantity, there should be great quality.",2.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,High Charges for VERY Low Quality Food,
Not recommend for Vegetarian Guests.  Was served Non Veg Food when I specifically ordered Veg Food in In Room Dining.  The approach of the staff after the blunder / corrective action was also very dismal.  ,3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Centrally Located Luxury Hotel,
"Wonderful hotel - location, service, room quality, restaurants (Dolce Vita Italian restaurant in particular) and decor. Only complaint I had is that the gym, whilst exceptionally well stocked with great Technogym gear, is way too small a space for such a large hotel - it really could / should be bigger. I would happily return to this place when next in Singapore.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great hotel - average gym,
The hotel probably has the best location in terms of navigating the major sightseeing spots in Singapore. Very close to many shopping malls and also to the Merlion Park and the Marina Bay View room has an amazing view. The rooms are a bit outdated and sofa has some pld stains. Offers reasonable breakfast buffet selection. Not the best hotel experience I've haf but definitely worth checking out this property. ,3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Very good location,
"I was wondering to book with Marina Bay sands but I am happy not to. Mandrin Oriental is stunning. The view is amazing. I could see the whole city just from my room. Everytimes i woke up and open my eyes, the view is just wow. Thanks to the house keeping lady that gave me a rose in the morning just because she though i am pretty. Hotel is so big but every staff is so friendly. I will keep choosing Mandrin Oriental for my next trip in Singapore.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Unforgettable experience,
"Booked a room at the club floor. It was one of the best club room I have tried so far. For the evening cocktail, the lounge serve Ruinart Champagne. The food and canapes was good. The service by the staff was fantastic. The only downside we have experience d was that the coffee came lukewarm until we have to specifically request for a hot one. Breakfast at the lounge was great. They have a menu for you to place your order. Most hotels served you a small spread of buffet.  The pillows in the room were way too soft.   The swimming pool was crowed because it has a wonderful view of the marina. I think they have the best view among the hotels in the bay area.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Awesome hotel with excellent view,
"I recently spent two nights in the Mandarin Oriental in a club room. Everything about it was superb from the check in in the lounge to the check out in the lounge. The club facilities are fantastic with wines, beers, soft drinks and tea and coffee available all day. The food is of the highest quality and plentiful. The atmosphere in the lounge is peaceful and relaxing, I really could not fault anything. If you are in Singapore and you want a club room then you will not get better than this. I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands after this and they were incomparable, if i could have gone back to the Mandarin then I would have done in a heartbeat.

"Used to love love love The MO chain and have stayed at their hotels in London,Hong Kong,Barcelona and hosted my daughters wedding in The MO in Las Vegas(before it became Waldorf)so you you can imagine what that cost--- Our room in Singapore was great as expected,the pool was great,The Cherry Garden was enjoyable and we were very well looked after by Alex and team in a The MO bar we also ate there. Breakfast as has been said many times before is quite frankly a shambles!Tables not cleaned properly no teapots available on 2 mornings and although they serve until 10.30 don't expect eggs after 9.45 as the egg station is closed!!On the whole very very poor for a Mandarin.It has made me think twice about staying at one again I think The Four Seasons chain has become more appealing.",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Breakfast let's this hotel down!,
Well run property with great service.  Expensive but is worth the money overall.  Very close to most things needed in the area along with easy access to other places with the staff support.  Food is very expressive in this property which is really my oy complaint.  Other than that overall a solid property with great staff and service,5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great Hotel,
"Physically and architecturally this hotel is spectacular.  The public spaces and the rooms are outstanding.  We were fortunate enough to get a room on the 20th floor facing the water and the view adds greatly to the experience.  Everything about the hotel is among the best available.  One problem we found is that we went to speak to the concierge on three different occasions, and all three times he was talking to another guest and it took up to 15 minutes to get to him.  With everything else they offer, it is surprising there is not more than one concierge.  By the way, his recommendations were exceptional.  Hotel has the best linens we ever slept on.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,WORLD CLASS,
"The highlight: Well placed side Marina architecture impressive room well insulated from the noise. Swimming pool very nice and well winded with a breathtaking view of the bay.Weak Point : certainly the food. breakfast well supplied but without any charm, no restaurant of renown, courteous staff but not really personalized service and it may be this that creates this impression of big machine certainly well oiled but without personality.",3.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Good but not exceptional,
"My room was not able to be opened 2 times with the room card key.  I was at level 15 so went down 2 times.  It was simply the delegates in my trip have the same name with me so the card identified only one name. Overall, the room was pleasant.",4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Room card not functioning,

"I can't fault this hotel so will be brief.This time I booked a club room so I had access to the lounge (quieter breakfast and access for meetings and free refreshments all day)... you also get a late check out. Worth the small extra sum.The hotel was very full for the ASEAN conference in November, however the staff were unflappable and service as good as ever.There may be newer hotels but non I have seen are as consistent.

"  First visit staying at an MO and couldn't have been better.  We had upgraded to a Club Room and so pleased we did - the extra benefits and service are what makes this hotel stand out.  Granted whilst it might not be the prettiest building from the outside, and a tad dated inside, it's location is perfect, and the view from the bedroom floor to ceiling window is nothing short of spectacular!  With club access we had impeccable service and the added extra of a delightful afternoon tea and cocktails and hourduvre's in the evening in a quiet and elegant setting.  Should we be this way again, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thank you to all the staff who have made our stay so memorable!  PS: the pool and it's setting is pretty spectacular too!

"This was our second stay here and we really love the room. The room comes we a nice and calming view. The bathtub was big and the was very clean as well.   Booking of the breakfast and swimming pool was easy. However, access to the swimming pool was further as we had to go through a different route to get there. We were not informed of the closure of the door closer to the room. We were also a little lost getting to the swimming pool. A clearer signpost/signages guiding us to the alternate swimming pool entrance could be useful.  Otherwise, the overall stay was great and we will be back again!",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A Great Staycation,
"The staff was very accommodating in allowing an early check in as we needed to prepare for a birthday surprise. The room was very clean and the view was nice. One small thing was that we could hear doors slamming quite loudly when people were exiting their rooms, especially at 7am,which I believe they were going for breakfast. The breakfast was simple, although it would be better if they hadore selections. There was a staff who was really really helpful, we were trying to find our way to Plaza Singapura and she directed us to this short cut that really helped to save time and save us from the heat! So thankful, although we didn't get her name. ",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A getaway from city life,

"Cons: We don't feel safe and secure. We stayed 2 nights and walked past the entrances in the morning, afternoon and night but didn't see staff man the 2 main entrances to the hotel. The reception is situated in one corner and don't have line of sight of visitors. No one to help with luggages. No one to enforce that visitors check in and out of safe entry. No one to check if visitors taking the stairs up to the hotel rooms are registered guests. So anyone can take the stairs to access the cooridoor to the hotel rooms.  Breakfast- limited to one main course. Coffee/tea were served luke warm.

However, there is no indications on the control panel in the room. Took a long time to figure out how to lower the bind, ended up seeking help from a chambermaid.

"It was a bummer that our staycation was during the phase when dining in was not allowed. Though we felt that the hotel could have done more (eg. give more food for breakfast since guests paid for a buffet or send the complimentary drinks to the room) rather than make us think that they might just be cutting cost. Also unimpressed with the service of some staff, 1st one was the unwelcoming guy at the entrance lazily giving out the round sticker and 2nd, the one who sent me a towel when I asked for a shower gel. Nevertheless, good location, the place is quiet and the pool and bathroom are very instagrammable.

It is my second visit to the hotel and it has still maintained its serenity. Staff there are always friendly and professional.   We ordered in dinner and the food was good!   Some things to improve:  1) Breakfast could be better but i guess they did the best with the no dine in option allowed.  2) The path to the swimming pool is abit long as you go to go via the Hotel lobby and to the basement and all. Wonder if a shorter route could be determined without compromising the safety measures in placed.   Other than that we would really love to go back again!

A truly unique hotel stay in Singapore amongst the greenery of Fort Canning Park. The hotel is atmospheric and beautifully appointed.  Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station for easy access to everything in Singapore. Staff were only too happy to accommodate our every need and assisted with lots of useful sightseeing advice! The restaurant was delicious and inexpensive. The swimming pools were perfect and complimentary towels appreciated. Our only recommendation would be that the raised tile edge around the bath in the room is a trip / toe stubbing hazard for travellers in unfamiliar rooms during night time bathroom visits. ( We had a garden view room).,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Loved the complimentary wine and aperitifs every afternoon,

"I know this City well and had lived here for 10 years, came back to visit. Picked this hotel due to its colonial appeal. Quite misleading, tiny claustrophobic rooms, very inconvenient to go back and forth from, barely any actual colonial ambience. Room cleanliness mediocre.

I have been to Singapore many times. Always staying at whatever shopping district and looking out to busy streets or smack into other buildings. This time around the weekend was about relaxation. Hotel Fort Canning is on top of a hill and park. When you lookout the window its either greenery or distant buildings. No cars zooming pass. Awesome rooms as well. I love the location and the staff was always on point and ready to be of assistance. The best part of this hotel is its staff and the location. The rooms are very clean and modern too.

"There are many nice things about this hotel.  The room was amazing and beautiful and relaxing.  The breakfast buffet was comprehensive.  The staff were very nice, sometimes too nice.  I felt like they wanted to make me happy even when they really weren't sure what they were saying:  bad directions, strange consequences of questions asked.  The setting is beautiful; the park is gorgeous.  But that was one of the problems I had with the hotel, which they can't change obviously.  The hotel is kind of isolated from things, which is saying something in a city like Singapore.  It takes some time to get to the subway stations or to walk anywhere.  So, there's nothing wrong with the hotel, and I'd stay there again, but I probably would probably try to get a hotel closer to the CBD.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Nice hotel, location an issue",

"The only things I could write negative are the quirky bathrooms (but that depends on who you are traveling with and your relationship, a few variations of the floorplan range from quirky to romantic, but nowhere to hang damp towels to dry in the one we stayed in) and that depending which way you walk to the hotel and you probably will, you can encounter 90-120 steps, or part way up escalators when coming from Clarke Quay direction.  The location is marvelous.  The staff are brilliantly professional and very helpful.   It is not a place for those who love 5-star international properties with hundreds of rooms and commensurate facilities - this is low key not in your face boutique style.  I would return anytime.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Tranquil, lux and different",

My overall experience was great as the hotel is beautiful and grand with very friendly staff. Although I was told that the check in time was 2pm, the front desk called me and informed me that I can check in around 1130 as the room was vacant and ready. Really appreciate this kind gesture. The doors to the garden needed some minor repair and there was a slight tear on the bed sheet.

She also went out of her way to fulfill our request to view the other rooms for our reference in the future. 2) Jonathan who served us in The Salon Restaurant. He did mention to us that he is not from the restaurant and just helping for the day. He is definitely one of the best service staff I have encountered, with his concise recommendations, explanations and friendly service. It really give us a positive and wonderful start to our HFC experience",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,HFC Staycation,

"my husband and I stayed here for 2 nights after a very long flight from Europe. This hotel is truly relaxing. The decore is gorgeous. The room we were given on Level 3 was beautiful. Breakfast was delicious and we had dinner there one night and it was also very delicious. The 2 pools are huge and really allows you to just chill and relax, exactly what we were looking for. Thank you Hotel Fort Canning..we will always book this place every time we are lucky enough to visit wonderful Singapore.. Ps/ Thank you to ALL the staff, they were very , vey friendly and nice.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Wow, great hotel !",
We were recommended this hotel by a friend and very happy that we decided to stay there. It is a heritage building that has been tastefully converted so that it has all the usual facilities without losing all the character. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom located towards the front of the room was a novelty. The breakfast was adequate. The service was good from all members of staff. The pool was warm and not too busy. It felt like an exclusive resort. The biggest downside was that taxidrivers were not familiar with it and it was a hike up the hill from the MTR until we discovered the escalators up from the Fort Canning station which made it a lot easier.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Boutique hotel, surrounded by trees, great service",
"Check in was pleasant, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and informative. He informed us that there's a free flow of wine & canapes at the lobby everyday from 6-7PM. Didn't get the chance to visit though. Room was very spacious and luxurious indeed with marble floor. Love the bathroom setting! Bathtub was very big. I notice the bed was bigger than standard king size bed as well. Breakfast was just okay. Very limited choices for a 5 star hotel. Spent about 80ish singapore dollar for 2 pax breakfast. We ordered grabfood the next day instead for breakfast. Location was at the heart of the city, even though we didn't get to stroll around the park or go anywhere else.  Overall, a very good experience!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Luxurious accommodation,
"Very clean rooms, very big rooms, polite staff, beautiful location, quiet, and a historical site set in a giant park, its one of the most important places in all of Singapore due to its strategic location during WW2 and was used as a British military site, and its a great place to unwind after going around the busy city. Its a very unique and elegant hotel. I really loved staying here. I have nothing bad to say about any aspect of my experience there. The location is just awesome you can walk comfortably to many of the museum, shops, and restaurants. I will stay here anytime I'm in Singapore!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,I Highly Recommend Staying Here,

"Situated atop Fort Canning hill, the hotel is close to the bustling shopping district yet manages to achieve a serene and quiet environment tucked away at the summit. With the magnificent room and an excellent breakfast spread, we never had to leave the hotel for anything else. Not that we wanted to anyway. Overall a great calming and relaxing experience. A perfect stay-cation destination for couples looking to get away.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Quiet, Peaceful and Tranquil Hilltop Retreat",

"Loved the location, which is just a short walk (about 1km) away from the hustle and bustle of the Singapore attractions around the Marina Bay area. The hotel itself is set in Parklands just next to the historic Battle box and near the National museum. A MRT station is also only a short walk away, but I did not use that. There is a restaurant on site that does a good pizza and also features a breakfast buffet. As a bonus they had my favourite beer in stock, Erdinger Dunkel :-)",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Serene haven,
"Staff were nowhere to be found, service was slow, food came out only after several reminder. Cutlery were dirty. Worst of all, the manager, Kumar(if i recall), was shouting at the staff, oh dear, how did this hotel get 4 star? This is my second time in Singapore and I'm very disappointed at HFC.",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Horrendous service at restaurant,
"It had been a long time since one hotel didn't surprise me that much (and I have stayed in many fancy ones)... The hotel is full of history, the staff is totally helpful, the room was modern and classic at the same time. Modern because everything is controlled by a touch screen panel and they provide a smartphone for all guests to use. And classic because the architecture is beautiful and amazing - not only in the rooms, the whole hotel, by the way. And every night they also offer complimentary drinks and finger foods in the lobby. It's not close to go by walking to marina bay, tough, if that's someone's interest... Anyway, what a fantastic experience, hope to come back someday!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,One of best hotels I've stayed,
We spent 5 nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and highly recommend this hotel. The location of the hotel in Fort Canning Park is great and makes for a very quiet stay in a busy city. We had an issue on our first night with a noise in our room and once we reported it to the staff they immediately moved us to another room. The staff were all lovely and very accomodating. The rooms are a good size and were very clean with nice outlooks to the park.The location of the hotel is good with Clarke Quay being a short and achievable walk even in the Singapore heat. Overall very happy with our stay.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Fantastic Stay,
"Beautiful rooms, helpful and friendly team. Loved the technology (including the cell phone you can take with you, the room control panel), incredibly comfortable bed (and awesome how they have pillows you can choose from), great pools (though wish it was slightly colder since it was so hot outside - almost felt like bathwater). It was a little tricky for some cab drivers to find the front lobby so at times we had to walk - I liked being a little removed in the park (very peaceful and felt out of the city), but it did make it difficult to walk to many places from the hotel. Just something to consider in thining about your goals for the visit. Overall very nice hotel and would definitely recommend!",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Beautiful hotel, high tech and quiet.",
"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for 5 days at the end of March and I must say we were very happy with our choice.

"Location in fort canning is wonderful. Rooms are amazing, especially the bathroom with marble and huge bay window.

Thank you very much.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Attentive and Amazing service,
"The service was excellent, from the time I stepped in to the time I checked out and even after when they offered guest to refresh before leaving for the flight. The was spacious and I felt like I was staying in 5 start resort. I also like the fact that they offered a hand phone with free data for the use of Google maps and international call for free. Thanks for this, really unexpected but absolutely welcomed. Overall the service, rooms, staff and amenities was good. The location may not be totally central as the taxis did not seem to be familiar with the area or hotel. and the entrance was dimly lit ta night.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Amazing hotel, Amazing service",

"If you enjoy access to big city but want a few quiet hours between shopping and sightseeing, HFC is a good location in green and quiet surroundings with lovely pool and great gym. HFC is more like a small resort. You have easy access to MRT. I was a bit imobile due to a recent accident. Hotel provided a wheelchair, staff was very helpful all round. Wheelchair access was no problem within the hotel area. We spent 3 days at HFC. It was a relaxing stay.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Enjoyable stay,
"Can't say enough about this hotel.  They have made an amazing transition from a former military headquarters to a very comfortable hotel.  We loved our room with the balcony bathroom and greenery view.  Many things to comment on on - wonderful staff, great food, large beautiful pool; surrounded with history.  We found this to be a real quiet respite from the hectic city.  Situated in a park on top of Fort Canning Hill is a great place to walk although a bit of a hike from public transportation.  If you do not want to walk we found taxi's available and relatively inexpensive. Treat yourself to his gem.  We hope to return again soon",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,An absolute gem,

I had a smooth planning with one of their staff name Fawly. She had the room set up for our wedding anniversary. Told her as well that i am coming with my kids and she ask if i need a baby cot. Great initiative!   Check in by Saif was a breeze.   The front desk staff definetly know who their guest and wish us a wedding anniversary.   Room was clean and awesome. Housekeeping service was great too when i requested them to my room.  Breakfast was yummy and the restaurant staff was friendly and service was great.   Check out was a breeze too by Abigail.

Would definetly reccomend couple celebrating their wedding anniversary to HFC as it is quiet and relaxing.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wedding Anniversary,

The staff are v friendly and there is also someone who brings us to the room to show us how to on and off the lighting, air  con etc.  In addition, they also decorated the room for our anniversary.

I had a few special requests during my stay at the hotel, and the hotel staff had played their part to meet and fulfil my requests exactly as I wanted.

"Was having a 1 Night staycation on 17th Dec. Room is spacious and the mattress is so comfy. However room cleanliness need improvement. Throw cushion cover on the bed was not tied properly hence both side looks different and unsightly. There are some debris on the floor. Standing shower flooring can see algae growing on the silicone and bathroom mirror was oily as well. Besides, was a bit disappointing that bathrobe only available upon request and it is a Yukata instead of bathrobe. It will be good as well if there is anti slip mat in the bathroom.

Our company has multiple shareholders and interested investors in Singapore and we are in Singapore 3-5 times per year.  We always stay at the Hotel Fort Canning it is open friendly and we have a balcony or windows that we can get the fresh air.  In Singapore you are lucky as there are a number of hotels that have an old world charm with opening windows and balconies but we like the Hotel Fort Canning as it is one the hill in the park.  Not glitzy not glamour just a lovely place to just be and the breakfasts are world class and they taste real.  Yes it is our home away from home.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Our Home away from home,
"If you fancy a respite from the hurly burly of Singapore then this is it.  Central Singapore ..... but set in the grounds of Fort Canning so you have peace and space.    The rooms are well appointed, the service is good.  Whilst the website talks of panoramic city views then this would be an over statement on the YWCA side.  Views are limited.  Pool area does not have the breadth and scale of a modern hotel - but you this is an acceptable compromise for the lovely position.   Overall a very enjoyable stay.    (If helpful do leave a helpful vote. Thanks )",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Good hotel in a great location,
Hotel staff were very accommodating and very friendly. Bathroom is breath taking. Gym facilities were advanced and complete. Didn't manage to try the pool but hopefully will get a chance to the next time I fly down to Singapore. Bed was comfortable and breakfast buffet was delicious! My view of the city was not too great but was not much of an issue for me.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Best place to stay and relax after a long day,
"The fact that you are literally staying in town but it seems like you are still in greenery, alongside having the historical aspect of Fort Canning on the doorstep, makes this a fantastic spot! The hotel is lovely and service does not disappoint. The pre-dinner drinks in the private lounge give a sense of class and refinement and are a wonderful way to relax into the evening. The staff were excellent: helpful, efficient and genuinely interested in ensuring our stay was all it could be. My wife and I travelled with two young children (9 & 6), and in Singapore, many hotels are set up for couples - making finding a room for a family quite difficult. However, the staff ensured we had connecting rooms and this was perfect.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"fantastic, in-town stay-cation, surrounded by greenery!",

This is a great hotel with super friendly staff and very nice facilities. Rooms are spatious and modern. I especially liked the bathroom with a view at Fort Canning park.

The hotel is beside a magnific Park, so to mee it is more important than the rest.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice hotel,
"We will be back! Loved the grand scale colonial architecture, very easy access to the truly wonderful Fort Canning Park and generally great location. The room, swimming pool and free evening drinks were also ok.

Airconditioning is a bit stale and general upkeep is starting to fail.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A very different Singapore hotel,
"I staying there because I got a very good rate for Singapore.

"The staff were all so friendly and ready to serve us as and when we arrive. No 'tunnel-visioned' staff or ones who would look away. They are so prompt and keen to serve all the time.

The only area of improvement is probably the design of the bathroom because the water flows into the living space through the door gap, making the threshold a bit untidy to walk through after a shower. But all in all, the place is fantastic!!!",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great service from staff,
"Attentive and courteous service. Lovely location. Great pool water! The evening (6-7pm) free drinks in the lounge for guests is a nice touch.

"Very good hotel for that price in general. It is situated near Clarke Quay in the beautiful green park. We liked to walk there in the evening. But it is on hill so be sure you like to walk :-). Rooms are small but with all in it and even little more (for instance coffe-machine, big cupboard, both shower and bath, free phone) and great scenery view from your room.  What we don't like: 1) All our pillows smell bad 2) Very thin walls - we hear our neighbors when they speak with each other or by phone 3) There is no exhaust ventilation in the bathroom and as result there is an unpleasant smell of dampness.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great for that price,
"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for 6 nights. The staff were all amazing - helpful in every way. The location of the hotel is excellent - very close to a number of MRT stations.

The rooms are very spacious, light and airy but have all the ""mod cons"" of a new hotel. The staff are very nice, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location is also a big bonus as it sits in Fort Canning Park which is a beautiful place and an easy walk down to The City, Clarke Quay or The Bay. Hopefully i'll get to return to Singapore one day and stay in this hotel again.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful Hotel,
"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hotel Fort Canning! The front desk staff was great; they answered all my questions and requests promptly.   I would make one small recommendation: As I was packing my things yesterday to checkout, one of my items fell and rolled under the bed. As I retrieved, I notice some dust and a pair of slippers under the bed. The cleaning staff must make a point of cleaning under the bed each time a guest checks out so the next guest will start from a really clean room.

The pool is one of best I have ever used; the temperature is perfect and the setting is great with trees.  There is also a lap pool.  The gym is in a separate building and has good equipment.  Breakfast has a good variety and a chef will prepare eggs as you like.  The restaurant is surprisingly good and not over priced.

Built in 1926 as the HQ for the British Far East Command it is a grand building with much history and now refurbished into a hotel. I particularly liked the free mobile phone in the room which has free local and international calls for your convenience, great for checking on the kids at home and at work from time to time. The location is great just a 15 min walk to Dhobi Ghat MRT and the Plaza Singapura Shops. I will definitely be staying here again and will recommend it to my family and friends.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Perfect Stay,
"Situated on a hill in a park, yet right in the shopping district. Quiet yet very central.  A colonial style building with an outdoor mineral water pool and a nice cocktail hour included daily.  Excellent service from the staff. Suite is huge and comes with a bathtub in the middle of the room. For a more private bath time, there is a small shower room also. Had a little issue with some ants but that was well handled by the staff.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Green retreat in the city,

So this property is quite nice as it looks over fort canning and it Is a old colonial property. We did not use any facilities but came to enjoy the area. We got a free upgrade into the suite which was very nice. However there was a wedding there and they were very noisy even late at night and they sort of took over the entire premise. From the room on the second floor there was also constant people peeking in from the hill itself. would have been very nice and romantic without these interruptions,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,nice neighbourhood but noisey,
"Positioned on the high ground above the urban sprawl.  The wife and I made full use of the surrounding parklands, walking and running the various tracks that encircle the hill.  Peppered throughout  are cultural and historical points of interest.  We did kick back as well enjoying the pools and evening soaks in the bath, cause we could. Oh and the Battlebox underground bunker tour is there also.  Great food, Great accommodation. Walk, bike or hop on hop off bus sites nearby...it's Singapore not much is that far away",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great strategic location,
We checked into our room after a long trip to find dirty sheets and urine on the toilet.  The hotel acted like they wanted to help but never resolved the issue. They downgraded our room but charged us the higher rate.  We we're so frustrated.  We thought as conference attendees we would get better treatment.,1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Dirty sheets and dirty toilet,

We were treated like Royalty with professional and personable attention to every minor  services detail. Nothing to small to please ...  No meals but the get together after 6 pm is a Must . Met such well travelled souls and all in the zone to share experiences.  Suggestion : a Vivaldi 4 seasons concerto accompaniment when the Roman blinds open up the Day for  you at the touch control bedside . Heavenly ...  Room 343 is a haven of peace and tranquility . Seeing a Singapore Thunderstorm 'unfold'  as you luxuriate in the Julius Caesar Bath (!) overlooking the madding crowds ignoble strife ... in the far distance ............. PRICELESS !

"Located on the edge of the park with the opportunity to go for walks there. Tastefully modernised  colonial building. Check in was friendly and fast and we could move into our room, even though we were early!  The restaurant serves a mix of international food and Singaporean dishes, which we enjoyed too. MRT (underground) is within walking distance, so all tourist attractions are within easy reach.  An added bonus was that we could not only leave our bags, but also were offered have a shower before going to the airport!  I would definitely stay here again!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Friendly oasis, close to Fort Canning Park",

Fort Canning Parc in the morning for a nice walk before a rich breakfast, free drinks and snacks in the afternoon, friendly and professional staff. Hope, we come back soon!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful place to stay outside the concrete,
"I enjoyed my stay very much.  I particularly love the automatic curtains of the bathroom windows overlooking the garden and bathroom door.  The AC can be controlled via a device by the night stand, which is super customer friendly.    Staff are very friendly and accommodating, easy to talk to since they understand and speak english well.  Even if the entrance of the hotel is not along the main road (located on top of a hill), getting a cab is quite easy with the help of the hotel staff.  Need improvement on water pressure of bidet - too strong, water leakage of bath tub faucet; old smell along the corridors",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Friendly and accommodating staff; Quick check-in,
"Hotel Fort Canning is a nice place, but obviously not that well known. Even several taxi drivers had some difficulties to find the entrance. Although it is a huge place. The service team is very friendly, the hotel is located in a beautiful park and a bit remote from downtown. Excellent also for functions of any kind. However, to Orchard Street it is just a 5 Min. walk. Rooms are very nice and in a very good shape, Breakfast offers local and international food in a wide variety. And two large pools that are hardly used offer an excellent spot to swim and relax (largest pool I have seen in a hotel for a long time). Unfortunately the bar closes at 10:30 pm. However, we enjoyed our stay at Fort Canning very much so !",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice stay in a hidden champion.,
"Excellent quiet, and spacious,  room - a haven in the park after a day's sightseeing. The free smart phone is a big plus. After a bit of orientation I was able to see everything I wished to using the nearby MRT station. Gratis champagne, wine and canapes for residents in the evening unexpected and well-received. Very good food in the Salon in the evenings with efficient service. Breakfast buffet range not quite what I'd read about in other reviews and a fair bit of traipsing around to the different food/beverage stations. Front of house very focussed and accommodating e.g. early check in, access to wifi. Overall, I'm glad I booked HFC and would certainly return",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great stay over Easter,
"Stayed here for 2 night on a short stopover......Can not fault it.. The Hotel is very modern without ruining the History of it. Could not be in a better location, Set in an absolutely stunning quiet park yet only a 10min walk from the night life of Clark Quay...so impressed we are booking back for next year",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,WOW,
Everything about the experience at this hotel is tops. It is grand while remaining intimate and unique. It gives you that feel of time long gone with all the amenities of a modern facility. The only downside is that you cannot really walk anywhere (or walk back because of the hill). My stay in SG going forward.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Grand old Feeling at this First Rate Hotel,
"Great hotel in the park not good if you don't do steps with it being on a hill. But close to everything public transport walking to sights etc.Room was well maintained nice decor comfortable bed with good quality bedding, nice to have the patio for outside space. My only issue shower glass door didn't seal well enough and left puddle of water on floor, but housekeeping left extra bath mats.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Awesome Singapore,
"I chose this hotel as it was away from the noise of the city. Set in a lovely area, the only drawback were the steps in and out if you wanted to go anywhere. The room was large but with the bath in the middle of the room, very odd! The toilet just had misted glass to protect privacy, which was useless. Really liked the happy hour and the pool was lovely and warm. Staff were helpful and friendly.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,hotel in a peaceful setting,
"The staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly when we arrived early in the morning, well before any check in time. The restaurant was also welcoming, with an extensive and delicious breakfast buffet. We enjoyed an evening meal and chose to stay in for supper on a second night. The room was modern and spacious, very striking to look at, though in places the design needed more care - steps to the bathroom area that would have been easy to trip over, for example.  One of our party used the sofa bed in the suite, and this was not comfortable or easy to negotiate. Overall, we found the hotel to be a very peaceful and welcoming base for exploring Singapore.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Peace and style in a lovely setting,
"We were referred to the Hotel by our group who travel regularly. It was a 'check it out for future trips' for the group. We wont be back! The bed was 'very comfortable' and the room quiet - water in the shower is spasmodic, still, all very nice, but the staff are surly and a bit up themselves, but suspect this relates to the room you are staying in. To be honest, we were very disappointed, and we are regular travellers and not that fussy. E.G The airport bus dropped us off at the base of the Hotel steps - like 40 steps up with 4 suitcases and this is Singapore sauna level heat and humidity! Sweating like pigs we got to the lobby and told the reception what happened - naively expecting some empathy or God forbid, a room upgrade, it was like, 'speak to the hand'.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,3 day stopover,
"Situated in the picturesque and peaceful Fort Canning Hill parklands, Fort Canning Hotel is a hidden gem. Whilst the renovated Hotel has all the Five star amenities you need in a hotel, the park surrounds offer the feeling of calm and space not often found so close major city centres. Fort Canning Hill is beautiful & compliments the Hotel so well giving you a real feeling of the tropical location. However its location is also right on the doorstep to some great cafe's, bars and restaurants. Its just a short walk to China town, Orchard road & little India. I would now not stay anywhere else in Singapore.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Space & Serenity on the City's Doorstep,
The hotel ambience was excellent and the rooms have high end technology.  Hotel is secluded from city hustle which is the highlight yet a stone throw away from city mains.  Breakfast had wide range of menus and tasted delicious.  However they could have been more ergonomically designed (like bathtub not needed within the room). That could have made the room more spacious.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Get-away from City Hustle,
The garden room has a nice little garden attached. Bathtub is in the middle of the room so it can be awkward for friends. Hotel is situated on top of a hill so a little climb is to be expected. We came here to celebrate birthday and the reception crew noticed this detail and gave a nice little cake.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Room with a nice garden view.,
"Fort Canning Hotel is a relaxing place thats a short stroll from Dohby Gaut MRT and Orchard Road. This conveniently means shopping and dinning isn't too far away. The hotel is located in Fort Canning park, which gives it a green and leafy outlook instead of the usual concrete and steel/traffic and noise/hustle/Bustle of most Singapore Hotels. There are two pools and most of the time they are pretty quiet and relaxing. The rooms are also well appointed, although the loos are not very priavte which is bit of a minor design flaw. The restaurant \/fitness club etc are all well appointed and the breakfast is recommended too... All told Hotel Fort Canning is a wee gem",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Tranquil with a few caveats,
"We love staying here and come back often - in fact we're coming back in July! Old world style and exceptional service, it's the best in Singapore. Breakfast buffet is always a pleasure and the drinks at 6 are not to be missed. The pool is fantastic and we love being surrounded by the Fort Canning Park forest with the sounds of birds and insects buzzing about. It's a peaceful, green oasis in the heart of Singapore. Love it!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Feels like home!,
"Situated on Fort Canning Hill, loved the nature surrounding the hotel and the swings atop the hill. Easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut, Bencoolen and Fort Canning MRT stations, although a bit of climbing is needed. Hotel staff were very friendly, approachable and informative. Receptionist showed us to our rooms personally even though we were located on the 3rd floor. Hotel had 2 swimming pools!! One for families and another being a lap pool. Rooms were modern, comfy and spacious. Deal came with breakfast included, food was not fantastic but decent. A thoroughly enjoyable 1-day staycation. My only regret was not being able to stay longer.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Excellent room, loved the nature surroundings",

"Would not recommend to buy St. Valentines package. Was a bit disappointed when I entered the room with deco and what was provided.  Also, got some problems with vanity and bad smell in bathroom.  In general Hotel is good looking in good and calm location (Fort Canning Park).

"Located in rainforest park in the centre of the city! It is on the top of a hill (I guess the clue is in the name!) And has a bygone feel.  You do have to walk down to MRT or hop on hop off bus. We could have done with a shuttle at times!!  For night life, you need a taxi. For us, we would have preferred Orchard Road location but that's just our choice.  Staff are attentive and helpful  - rooms has an interesting twist - bathrooms are situated on the balcony area. Do say if it's not what you  want!",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Lovely hotel,

"This is a lovely colonial style hotel in a middle of a park.   Although the hotel was running full the day we stayed, we still felt the hotel as generally very peaceful and quiet.   The pools were almost empty when we went for swims and the enormous gym had advance equipment that really impressed us.  We booked a Premium Room and we totally love the layout and the fusion of colonial and modern interior. Space was alright for two occupants especially the oversize bathroom.  We booked the Christmas Themed dinner at the Salon and we came back to our room full and happy!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Short comfortable Christmas weekend stay!,
I flew to Singapore on business and opted to stay at the Fort Canning.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Desk area perfect for working late into night. The bathrooms were very large although the water temperature in the shower was suspect (probably an isolated situation).  The pool was a little walk from my room and wasn't all that impressive but the gym was great!!  The breakfast catered for many tastes and was huge. I don't think i had lunch most days.  The hotel is well located but the hill makes it not the ideal place for those who will not be in a cab.  I would recommend this hotel but would probably chose a hotel not on top of a hill the next time.   ,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A Fine Fort,

"The service was good with all people very friendly and helpful. The room was great, large enough but the bathroom on the outside took a bit of getting used to, and the lack of a balcony in such a serene area is a mistake. The location is great and Canning Park is wonderful, we had a walk in the park.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Fort Canning Hotel and Canning Park were great,
"Hotel and rooms are unique, different from other hotels that I have stayed. The swimming pool is nice but there's no drink bar or service for drinks, there was a phone nearby but not sure if it was meant for that but we later saw the notice that no food and drinks are allowed. The Salon is great with good food and service, staff are prompt and attentive, really satisfied dining at the restaurant.  We find the shower awkward, shower head will not face down and will spray at the wall, shower wall has a gap and the shower door can't be closed properly and bathroom will be wet after each shower, requested for 2 more floor mats but not enough to dry the floor. Got a complimentary slice of cake for birthday celebration, that's all.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Nice and pleasant overall, still a special day for us",
"Great hotel located on the edge of Fort Canning Park, enabling lovely walks just out of the door.  A 10 min walk to the bustling night life of Clarke Quay and easy access to the MTR.  Rooms / Restaurant / Gym / Service all top notch... just simply a great place to stay",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Great hotel, perfect in so many ways, great central location: oasis of pleasure",
"The location of the hotel is very good, close to nature, which is the reason we chose this hotel for our wedding anniversary stay. The room is nice. However the amenities are very basic, there is no steam or suana room in the gym or swimming pool and the gym is at a separate building that has no link to the main hotel rooms building. The service is only average, lower than what we had expected from a 4 or 5 class hotel. There is only two guest officers at the front office and sometimes, only one when I need some assistance. I would say the room rate is more for the nature and the room itself. For that price, one would expect to have better amenities and service.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Stay to enjoy the nature,
We spent 4 nights at the hotel in January 2018. It was delightful. The room was spacious and well appointed. There were plenty of power points which is so unusual in hotels! There was even a mobile phone for guests to use during their stay. Calls could be made to 10 or so countries including Australia - free of charge as well. The bathroom was the feature of the space. I was able to lie in the bath and enjoy a lovely garden view. Bliss! A beautiful experience which we highly recommend for a serene environment in  gorgeous Fort Canning Park.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Tucked away in a Beautiful Park yet close to all the Main Attractions,
Frozen goods served at breakfast. Unfriendly staff. They kept holding extra amounts from my credit card even after 1 month of the checkout. I have never seen such thing before. The only good thing with this hotel is the location.,1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Not a 5 Star Hotel & Credit Card abuse,
"Beautiful and elegant hotel. The whole place is surrounded by lots of greens, the location is quiet and calm, one can hardly hear any noises of traffic.

"This hotel is professionally run and clean, but will appeal to some more than others. The rooms have a curious layout with the view in many dedicated entirely to the bathroom (i.e. you walk in and are in the bedroom and living area, then the next space - taking up the full window frontage - is the bathroom), and it is not clear from the inside whether there is reflective glass on the outside. So if you're on business and working, you have to look at the view through a bathroom the whole time. Maybe it would work better on a personal holiday but I'm unsure about that either.  Everything in the room - lights etc. - is operated by a touchpad device and it's all just a bit overwhelming. Against that though, the staff are very helpful and pleasant. The food is good.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,An acquired taste,
"This is a beautiful hotel with an interesting colonial history, set amidst the peaceful gardens of Fort Canning Park in central Singapore.  Beautiful large rooms & bathrooms with a wow factor, and the beds are very comfortable. Gorgeous outdoor pools, delicious breakfasts, helpful & courteous staff, and free drinks and nibbles between 6-7pm a nice touch. We recommend the BattleBox tour of the WW2 allied command bunker, just a few minutes from the front of the hotel. Fort Canning park itself is lovely, with lots of trees & walking paths.  Centrally located but it felt like another world away from the bustle of the city.  A short walk down to Clarke Quay and an easy taxi ride to almost anywhere.  We enjoyed staying here and would love to return.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Beautiful colonial hotel - lovely rooms, swimming pools & peaceful central location",
"We chose HFC for its location and its historical significance.  However, we were disappointed that the hotel's offerings did not live up to our expectations.  This is not a cheap hotel. However, there is only one dining option which is limiting.  The air conditioning in our room was so noisy we resorted to turning it off at night.  In addition, our room was not sound proof due to an adjoining door with the next door room. As a result we could hear our neighbour's conversations loud and clear.  The hotel does deserve some bouquets, however.  Service was excellent and we were very grateful for the luggage storage and shower facilities afforded us in lieu of a late check out. We did, also, appreciate the nightly happy hour of free wine for hotel guests.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent location,
"Stayed 2 nights. Beautiful room and excellent amenities.  Excellent staff, very attentive.  We did the breakfast buffet one day, and then a la carte the following, and food was great. The park is gorgeous, very nice respite from the city. Location is up on a hill in the park, and the signs up the hill to the hotel are not clear and so we had some trouble finding the hotel entrance and getting ubers to pick us up (they would cancel after looping around the grounds). This can be easily fixed I image by the hotel.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Love hotel - signage could be improved as hard for taxis/ubers to find,
We had a problem with our booking due to our son not being able to join us. The front desk staff were amazing and so accommodating.

We will definitely be back! ,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Fantastic Stay,
"Location was great with lots of greenery around, eateries and malls nearby too. Stayed here during christmas eve and they were clearly short handed as we waited almost 2hrs to check in, even when we reached there after the check in time.  We headed to the lounge to get drinks and light snacks, only to find out that other guests waiting for their rooms were served complimentary drinks at the lobby area. Would probably appreciate if the staff could inform us about it so we don't have to waste money when it's not our fault that rooms were not ready.  Saving grace was that the staff offered us complimentary breakfast and late check out at 2pm. The room was worth the wait! Would definitely be back again.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Friendly staff,
"A beautiful and impressive hotel situated in extensive ground; helpful and pleasant staff and very unique rooms, which may not be to everyone's liking.

"Enjoyed four nights at HFC after 4 weeks travelling through Vietnam and Cambodia.  The historical building has been beautifully refurbished - five stars for accommodation and facilities.  Friendly and helpful staff. It was a relaxing break. Be aware that you will have a ten minute walk to the nearest MRT station.  Not a problem unless it is raining.

"We've stayed at this hotel now a number of times as it's always been a great spot for stopovers to/from Australia but when we stayed earlier this month, I have to say, we were disappointed.  The service has become somewhat off hand and the restaurant in the hotel, where we ate dinner (which has been refurbished since our last visit) was totally lacking in character with incredibly bright lighting & bland food.   It used to be such a charming spot but I think now we'll probably look at other hotels for our next stay in Singapore.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,We were a little disappointed on our most recent stay,
"Great hotel with character.  We stayed for 9 nights October/November.  The room was spacious, quiet and overlooked the park.  The staff were extremely polite, helpful and friendly.  Quiet during the week, busy on Saturday with 3 weddings but that didn't interfere with the hotel service, just lovely to see.  10 minutes walk to Clarke Quay, Orchard Road and the MRT in 2 directions.  In the business of Singapore it was a peaceful haven.  Hopefully we will return!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Peaceful and Relaxing,

"May not be in the City Centre, but that has it's advantages. Surrounded by park with plenty of space to wander without being in the city. The room contained a fabulous skyline view from the bathroom, a Nespresso Machine and an IPod to take with us when we explored Singapore, we could use it to ring for Taxis, directions etc. Lots of Military History, including an Underground Bunker, ""Battle Box"" etc all within walking distance.

Colonial building is really fascinating and room is furnished and accessorized in a elegant and functional way (I especially appreciated the Nespresso machine inside).

(Google Battle Box.) Personal service in a relatively smaller but very high-end hotel environment made it top to our taste.  Low on kids & no pets. Offered snacks & drinks during happy hour (for guests only). Nice rooms with big bathroom and extra salon space or smaller with private terrace garden, depending on your room type choice. 2 swimming pools. We sure appreciate much more this hotel above the high-end big chains. Very nice stay that we prolonged a week extra!

"Room 201 on the second floor. This room shouldn't even be a room. We were too tired on arrival after a trip to Thailand to complain, but this room faces the pool and if you like sunlight (like I do) everyone in the pool can see through into the bedroom if you have the curtains open. There is zero privacy at all. You have to choose between privacy or daylight. Ridiculous. We were there for only one night. I am not sure if I'll give this place a second chance, but our first impression was not a good one.",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,This is a review for room 201 only,
"Room was cool with full length glass window in the toilet and automated curtains. The morning scenery was great with the greenery outside the window. There were too many mirrors in the room. Maybe it's western type of hotel there are bibles keep in the room. I don't feel any discomfort, so I think they are there just for precautions.  Staff were very helpful and fast action.  It was my friend's birthday and we got a delicious slice of cake from the hotel.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful room with technology,
"This is a colonial building renovated to fit in rooms for hotel so it has lost its grandeur of original architecture inside. In a city state of Singapore the hotel is in a park called Fort Canning where they British troupes resided  in WWII. It is nice to see big trees in the park but you have to call taxi each time you go out for shopping or dining. The hotel itself is not so huge to enjoy though they have a nice small lap pool . The restaurant looks and sound like a canteen so we decided not to eat there. If they call this hotel five star , we are so spoilt and must look for more stars hotel .",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,is this called five star?,

Staff was also attentive to detail - put a request via booking.com and they actually did it.  Love that the hotel is in a quiet location but still in the ""central"" of Singapore.

Breakfast moderate because of under capacitity of coffee machine and lack of attention to keep the buffet items available ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Comfortable place,  price quality balance oké ",
Poor sound proofing. Could hear people coughing in rooms nearby.  Lots of ants running in the room and in bed.  Sheets are torn and not very clean. I have dust allergy and I got rashes all over my body. Many of my colleagues in the conference slept poorly too.   The architecture is nice though.,3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Poor sound proofing.

"Stayed here over the weekend. Was a lovely experience being a first timer and used to hotels such as Capella and MBS, I was not disappointed! The hotel lived up to its boutique hotel name and although what I used was a complimentary staycation voucher, I know I will be back for sure! Special mention to Manager Eric for his polite and excellent service rendered towards us! Kudos for having such staff on your team!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Lovely and Serene environment nestled in the heart of the city! Ideal for staycations :),
"Nice quiet hotel for a good getaway. Right in the middle of fort canning park, it is so close to nature and it makes you feel away from the bustling city. Room is spacious and nice, We had a good anniversary stay with our daughter. Service was good and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you HFC for the nice room upgrade.    It is quite a walking distance to the nearest mrt stn and shopping mall. Not for those looking to shop/dine at their convenience.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Nice quiet hotel for a good getaway,",
"Nice, nature friendly place. Love the room decoration, esp. restroom which views towards the front yard (remember to pull down the curtains ha ha :)). Front desk staff (Ms. Lee) was really helpful. Minus point for my stay here was the loud music from a company party on the hill next to my room (outside of hotel but still annoying till late night)",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great sneak out place!,
My wife and I had a delightful stay at Hotel Fort Canning after our wedding celebration. The staff at the hotel were warm and extremely hospitable. They had made special arrangements for us in the room by decorating it with rose petals. The rooms were clean and very new. I appreciated the updated technology used for lighting. It was most wonderful to have a bath tub in the room! Special thanks to the staff at the hotel for a memorable stay.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,New Rooms! Warm Stay with Friendly Staff,

"Hotel Fort Canning is situated in the Northwest corner of Fort Canning Park in the middle of Singapore. The location gives the hotel a special ambience of being secluded in the middle of the busy buzz of the city. The hotel itself is relatively small which gives it a very personal atmosphere. Our room had an open bathroom facing the north side of the park. The room was comfortable, with an excellent bed.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent oasis in the middle of Singapore,
"Good gym. Love it.  However as a business traveller, the Internet connection in the room is equivalent to that which you experience in a third world country. Makes emails almost impossible. Would not stay here again due to the lack lustre infrastructure. It is not too much to ask for for a 5 star hotel to provide solid connection wifi to the room. Very disappointed.",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Good gym, worst wifi",
"Only stayed for a couple of nights but it was lovely, swimming pools are beautiful, staff are lovely and the food is outstanding! Can't fault the hotel at all, room was lovely complete with safe, roll top bath, air conditioning and electric curtains.   We loved the location in the park, however, some people may feel it's too far from the centre being 15 minutes walk away. Probably not suitable for the less mobile ad quite hilly around the area but taxis from the front door are readily available.  Perfect location for national museum of Singapore and Battlebox (both of which we recommend).   25 minute walk from gardens of the bay as well. When we return to Singapore we will stay here.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Lovely hotel in a picturesque location,
"This was our hotel for our wedding reception, here are our thoughts:  Ambience: 4.5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Customer Service: 4/5 Location: 2.5/5 Value for Money: 3/5  The Good: Very quaint hotel, excellent ambience and good customer service.  The Bad: The climb up the hill to get there can be quite challenging, and parking here can be tough, would recommend to come here via cab or Grab/Uber.  The Bottom Line: It's quaint, prices are a bit steep, would come back at the right price. ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,3.5/5,

"The Hotel Fort Canning is tucked away on the hill on the very edge of the City surrounded by beautiful parkland.  This renovated 1920's Colonial building is delightful in that it is like living in a beautiful Old home but has all the mod cons.  After a very busy day of sight seeing, the Hotel was a haven. The Staff were wonderful, food delicious, the rooms a delight.   We were provided with a mobile phone for our use which included overseas calls as well as local calls, allowing me to phone home each day.  Also included was complimentary Happy Hour each evening and buffet breakfast.  The surrounding gardens and pools are also beautiful. We really loved staying here.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,In a world of its own,

"The hotel was quite a distance from MRT and climbing flight of stairs is needed. Room was great, but lack of privacy as windows are not tinted therefore unable to enjoy the view, which is quite disappointing as its the key features of the bathroom. Breakfast live station was good, but overall lack of variety.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Urban feel, staff and interior was good.But windows can be tinted for more privacy.",
"Hotel Fort Canning is a beautifully restored building. The Customer service is just wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are lovely and beds are very comfortable.  The location is great if you like to be away from the hustle and bustle. If you struggle psychically with climbing up steep hills then getting in & out of this hotel will be a challenge. There are many, many steps to be climbed from street level to get to the Hotel entrance, I found combined with the intense hot weather a cab was required both ways each day to see the sights of Singapore. The garden and surrounds are just stunning to see.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Old World Charm,
"Alcoholic drinks are very expensive in Singapore compared to Australia. What a wonderful surprise to find that for an hour sometimes more, each day, free wine and canapes are offered to hotel guests. We took advantage of this each evening before dining in The Salon. The Dinner menu offers a great range of choice. All meals we had were beautifully presented and deliciously tasty. Breakfast choices were also very extensive and delicious. A complimentary Smart phone came with our room. Free international calls! No need for own phone . Google maps while out and about meant we always knew where we were. Tastefully modernized inside, the building was originally a British Military Administration Headquarters dating from around 1930. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,More than  a Happy Hour.......,
"I had booked a studio suite for a proposal to my girlfriend who is my fiancee now. Liaised with Maggie Chow on the plan and obtained their kind assistance to keep it a secret upon our arrival. The surprise element was supposed to be experienced by my fiancee. However, HFC came up with their own surprise for us too by upgrading our room to the Governor's suite. I was totally caught off guard by it. Overall, the proposal was a success thanks to HFC staff team. Thank you to those staff that assisted. It was definitely a memorable proposal.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Memorable place for our Proposal,

"There are several things to love about Hotel Fort Canning. First would be its location as it is centrally situated but still secluded within Fort Canning Park. The location alone makes HFC an excellent hotel to stay in as it is like a small palace within a massive courtyard. Whenever I go for staycations, I always want to have that sense of exclusivity but we all know that it's often akin with an expensive price tag. HFC gives you that exclusivity without burning a hole in your pocket. Lastly, as a former hotelier and currently in the customer service line, I am very particular with the service that a hospitality institution provides and HFC has exceeded my expectations. To add on, their hallways and rooms have that subtle yet pleasant aroma, they smell amazing!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent for Staycation,
"As a makeup artist in Singapore, I have visited a lot of hotels. HFC is one of my fav because of its beautiful colonial yet modern architecture. We stayed in the premier delux room. Room is big, love the ceiling to floor window, makes the room more spacious and bright. open concept bathroom with marble interior design is just beautiful and calming. Love that the room has got so many mirrors, no need to squeeze with anyone to do your makeup or check your outfit!   The bed is quite comfortable.   Sound proofing is not the best though. can hear people talking outside the room.  Will love to come back here again!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Awesome anniversary celebration staycation,
"A fantastic hotel set in Fort Canning Park. The rooms were smallish but very well decorated and set out.

Upon check in we were greeted by this polite staff and welcoming us to the check in desk. Check in process was very efficient.  If you love privacy and quiet surrounding this is the hotel to be. It's walking distance to MRT station but hot weather might put you off or if you are carrying lots of shopping bag you might find it difficult to walk. Anyway hailing public transport are so convenient in Singapore now.  We love the pools as well, two big pools to choose! ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Colonial Charm with Friendly Staff,

"Nice hotel in a park. Small gym and pool area but decent rooms. Bathroom is on the exterior wall which is a little weird but many hotels in Singapore have that arrangement.

I am Australian and I live on the coast but on the edge of a forest by the beach. So I like the water and the trees.  Hotel Fort Canning is my place as it has the pool with the forest right beside the hotel. The other thing that I like is air. My room at Hotel Fort Canning has a door and a balcony. My Chines friends thing that I am not hip as you need glitz glamour and lots of activity.  I think that I need the opposite.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,I am now accustomed to the Hotel Fort Canning it fits like a glove,

"I stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for two nights as our team had Aerotropolis Seminar there.  The building itself, the surrounding park and the rooms are just great. The facilities of the hotel are still great, although it's obvious that the building exists for some years already. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms and enjoyed the exclusive design and interior a lot. Welcome reception with drinks and snacks, complimentary coffee and tea in the room, and free WIFI are just some to be mentioned....  However, the location is soo secretive that even a taxi driver can lost their way coming to the hotel. Nevertheless, I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Fort Canning very much and would not only recommend it anyone else but also go there again!",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great hotel,
"The hotel is located on top of a hill set amongst beautiful gardens which provide both a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, and some lovely walks. The reception and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and spacious with a stunning marble bathroom and a huge freestanding bath. We also had a little sunroom with a very comfortable chair. There was a free yoga class on Sunday morning and we had the entire pool to ourselves for our 4 day stay. The buffet breakfast selection was great and the bar, although expensive, did have quite an extensive list.   My tip would be to take the some of the guided tours offered to learn about the history of Fort Canning Park and make the most of the amazing gardens.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Spacious hotel amidst beautiful gardens,

"My fiancee and I decided to book a stay at this hotel after reading excellent reviews from others online. Indeed, the hotel has a modern and colonial feel. Perhaps because of this, our room has a high ceiling and the balcony is turned into a bathroom, which offers panoramic view of the Orchard area. However, we could not adjust the air-conditioning to above 23 deg C, so we turned off it off for a while because we felt it was too cold. Other than that, the hotel facilities are excellent (we tried the pool and the gym) and the frontdesk staff are attentive and friendly. I would recommend this hotel if you are intending to experience something different from typical hotels in Singapore.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice hotel on the hill,
"I loved the location of the hotel. Central and surrounded by loads of green. After five days at the hotel, and you pretty much covered everything in the hotel, the hotel becomes dull and boring. Breakfast choice was plain and nothing exciting. I was not too happy with house keeping. Couple of times, they didn't do a good job making sure my room was liveable for the 5 days I stayed at the hotel. Overall, it is a good hotel BUT not great.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Dull but Good,
"The service from the front desk to the housekeeping was warm and friendly. The room was clean, cosy, and exactly as in the pictures, although a little smaller than expected. The hotel isn't located in the middle of all the attractions you might want, but its secluded location makes it a great place for a stay-cation and a hideaway from the bustling city. The complimentary drinks provided in the evening is a good bonus as well. Breakfast buffet , although limited in choices, was fantastic otherwise.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Above expectations!,
Nice Hotel with a colonial touch. Placed in the mid of the botanic garden in Close range to Orchard Road and Clarke's key. Rooms with nice view. Food and breakfast very tasty and with a rich choice of several dishes.

So please be Aware not getting a cold.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice stay in the mid of the botanic garden of Singapore,

"The swimming pools are wonderful due to the surrounding trees and quietness.   Unfortunately, we stayed in a Deluxe Room on the second floor and I hardly caught any sleep due to the blanket that is way too thick such that you'll be sweating even with the air-con at full blast. Furthermore, the door is not soundproof, so you'll hear it every time someone enters or exits any of the rooms along the same corridor.   I hope they put some padding on the doors so that they don't slam.  On the plus side, their staff are friendly.",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great swimming but the rooms are not for light sleepers,
"Experienced a pleasant stay at the hotel. While exploring the grounds, it felt as though we were staying in a colonial retreat as the Fort Canning area is secluded.The lobby wasn't busy or noisy.

"Loved everything about the hotel. Location? Hop on Hop off just across the street and hotel is connected to a shopping mall. Room was clean, comfortable and with a nice view.

Just delightful !!!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Top of the line !!!,

"Service from front desk was smooth and good. Bellman service was also very good. Kudos to the indian gentleman for his help! Thank you. However, housekeeping needs to improve tremendously. 1. Our room was not cleaned properly. Floors were greasy and dusty. Cabana at the patio was filthy. 2. Noise at the common corridors made by housekeepers laughing and joking about when we were asleep. 3. We turned on the""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign and yet we were disturbed via the telephone numerous times by housekeeping to CLEAN our room. Come on, seriously? This is the first hotel who had such lazy housekeeping service. Why can't they wait until the guests leave the room and then clean the room?   Regretted choosing this place.",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Horrible housekeeping,
Staying here for the second time in two years and little has changed. You are given a very personal check in and as this was our second visit were given an upgrade with a garden view. The rooms are very comfortable with great beds and bathrooms the only down side being lack of power sockets and no only one hard chair. Breakfast is very varied and pleasant without the crowds of some Singapore hotels. There are two swimming pools with plenty of towels available and a dial up bar service for drinks or snacks. You are way up above the hustle and bustle but only a short distance to reach the action. There is direct access to Canning Park and walking to either Orchard Road or  Clarke Quay is very possible. ,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A Calm Oasis,
"The overall ambience of the hotel is great. The staff were very friendly and approachable. The spacious bathroom which has a wonderful view and the bathtub is a plus point. Another plus factor is the swimming pool. It has a children family pool and also a lap pool. However, when I book the room, the picture of the room show a small table and a chair.

The former army barracks has been beautifuly restored and renovated.  It is located within a park and consequently has a very relaxed and peaceful feel, yet is within easy walking distance of Clarke Quay and other notable sites. The service was excellent as well.

Have stayed at this hotel before. Service was as good as always and they even delivered my partner a birthday cake to the room. Location is great and 2 swimming pools very relaxing BUT our room smelt very musty - we could clear the smell a  little with the air con on full but if we turned down the smell came back. Corridors also smelt musty. Didn't have this issue before but have noticed a few other reviews with the same issue. Shame as it spoils an otherwise perfect hotel.,3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Good but musty smell,

"A magnificent residence with old world charm. Check in was seamless and the room was graciously styled. The hotel, for the most part, was very quiet even though it was fully booked. The service from the wait staff in the lounge, restaurant and front desk were exceptional.  My only complaint were the rude and entitled children allowed to run and scream down the halls, throughout the lobby and into the lounge. Although this is mostly a parental issue and not the fault of the hotel, perhaps it is necessary to post reminders that children should be supervised at all times. ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet Luxury,
"Stayed for a week over the Christmas/New Year. Generally ok but probably won't stay here again.  Pros: Quiet location in the middle of a beautiful park. 10 minute walk to MRT. Very friendly, attentive wait staff at breakfast.   Cons: Mobile phone for guest use, including international calls.  Only problem was phone didn't charge properly despite reporting problem to reception. Nice idea though.  Bathroom needs to be given a good scrub to get rid of mould in shower recess.

"We have stayed several times at this hotel and there is not much to complain over. The breakfast could be more extensive for this class of hotel but it is ok. We are used to walk to were ever we want to go and this hotel is not close to anything really but on the other hand there is a very beautiful park to walk throug, otherwise you are taking a taxi. The service is 5 star and there is a feel of old english class.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Historical Hotel,

"I went there with my spouse during zica period. Short say, they told me to pay for mosquito repellent instead of providing it free due to the endemic and considering its a 5 stars hotel its a bit cheap reaction. Too bad, because the hotel location is actually great and the history lies behind is intriguing. I would say the bathroom is the actual luxury area compare to the room. Unluckily, i stayed over the weekend when they had a wedding, so it was so noisy in the corridor.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Not my best experience,
"This is a beautiful hotel on the Fort Canning Hill.  A luxury hotel that has it all (well almost). We were made welcome, despite out quite late arrival, provided with excellent support in understanding the technology in the room (electronics blinds, lights etc), thick cotton sheets and a mattress that was firm but giving.  The buffet breakfast was brilliant and the bar does great cocktails.  The two swimming pools were warm and inviting.  My only quibble is that the wifi seemed particularly slow and given the attention to detail in all other aspects of the hotel I found this surprising.  However, despite this, you should stay here at least once in your life.  It's a classic.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,5 star in everything but wifi,
The Hotel Fort Canning is a beautifully restored fort in a central location in Singapore.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The automatic full blackout blinds were much appreciated while trying to overcome some jet lag.  The grounds are magnificent with historic sites and gardens all on the hill.  The staff were very accommodating. I clicked mid price but its really luxury features for a mid priced hotel. I can't say enough good things about the whole experience.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful Hotel in a beautiful setting,
"The room are great, service is very arranging, and nice atmosphere in general. Good bar listing with Piper-Heidsieck by the glass, nice view on the greeneries. I would really recommend this place.

"Beautiful hotel,a world away from the hubbub of orchard road but only 2 stops away on the MRT.Rooms aren't large but a mix of old world charm and modern technology.Free happy hour was a nice surprise and very enjoyable.Two huge pools shallow at one end for children and a large pool for serious swimmers.The staff 11 out of 10 very helpful and friendly.Breakfastwas$25 very good with plenty of choices with local and western cuisine..A short walk to Dhoby Ghaut station when your ready to explore,Fort canning park is huge 7 acres right outside the hotel,A great place stay",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Tranquil oasis,
We enjoyed this hotel very much.  It was the former British Far East Headquarters during WWII.  It has been beautifully renovated.  It is situated in the Park overlooking Singapore.  We walked downtown as Clarke Quay is fairly close.   Just walking through the park is very historical!  Beds are very comfortable.  Happy hour every evening with wine and horderves.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great Hotel,
"Rooms were a good size, Bathroom as well. Bed was a bit too hard for my liking. Set in a parkland there is no traffic noise. 10 minute walk to Orchard road and other facilities. The 2 for one deal in the bar helps ease the pain if you like a beer or two. The staff provide excellent service with a special mention to Abigail, Erica and Ruby. The hotel staff made our stay feel so much more welcome. it was our 30th wedding anniversary and the room presentation was a pleasant surprise, it was a very nice touch. This place is also wedding central, I was actually surprised by the amount of couples. Over all this is a good place to stay.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excelent place to stay,
"Room was clean, modern with a luxurious bathroom and a very comfortable King bed.  Staff was very friendly.  Location is very peaceful as it's located in the midst of a park.

"Great for a wedding venue, two in the three nights I stayed, not great if you don't enjoy the wedding guests taking over the hotel day and night.   Restaurant is poor, pizza and burgers.

"We spent one week in Singapore and stayed at Fort Canning. Beautiful rooms, spacious, and full of light. Breakfast was included and they had a good variety of food. Service was exceptional. One caveat:  the hotel is up on a hill, and there is no good way of getting public transportation.  You have to walk down the winding hill or take a bunch of stairs, then walk to the nearest metro. Since it is located inside the park,  you also cannot just walk out for a cup of coffee or shopping. Taxis are everywhere and relatively cheap, so if you don't want to walk, and you are ok waiting for one,  it's reasonable to use taxis.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Great stay, great service",
"We stayed there for a night on October 2nd in a room in level 3. It was love at first sight. The room is awesome! It is clean, beautiful and wonderful. Totally in love with it, especially the toilet. A pity we did not get to visit the pool as it was a short stay. Nevertheless, we will definitely stay over again. The hotel staffs are friendly and approachable. The restaurant in the hotel serve good food as well.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wedding night stay,

"HFC is a great place to unwind in the middle of the city.  When we were there, there was a wedding function so the hotel was busy.  Service was great and the staff very very friendly.  Breakfast was ok while room service option was as expected, normal.  It is best to book through one of the websites hotel.com or booking.com as the nornal rates at HFC can be pricey especially on weekends.  I would recoemmend to tourists who are in Singapore for the first time.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Good staycation experience,
"We enjoyed the interaction with each and every staff, from the front desk, housekeeping, maintenence to room service folks. Liked the room a lot, old colonial charm but with a modern touch.

Will love to come back again!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Perfect stay!,
"It's a really great pampering weekend for me. Place is spacious and clean and service was top notch. When we were there, there were a couple of weddings going on. The venue is gorgeous and beautiful, excellent choice for weddings. The weddings did not really make loud noises to the room, we were not bothered at all. The best thing about this place is it is right across Clarke Quay, the most happening place in the city.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Weekend Getaway - quiet but happening,
"This is where you will find peace and harmony. The rooms are spacious and very well decorated. Service is incredible as they spoil your every need. It's quiet and private and the prices are not steep. The only draw back is you have to walk up from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, which is not really that enjoyable in the hot humid Singapore sun.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Away from the maddening crowd,
"An excellent choice for a stop over in Singapore. Hotel was well located, although a bit of a walk but through a beautiful park. Room was great, facilities including the pools were great, breakfast very well stocked and fresh.  Singapore itself is worthy of a much longer stay than the 3 days we had. The hotel seems popular for weddings with quite a large number during the weekend we stayed, the organisation seemed very smooth and non intrusive to other guests.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Really good hotel,
Staff were very friendly. The room service was good and and the room was clean. The hotel is located in the middle of a park on top of a hill.  Hassle free check in/out. Enjoyed my time there.

Everything was perfect from the arrival to the departure...my friend was the king of ""burma"". The room was beautifull, good location, modern with a flavour of history. Unfortunately..we were 2  travellers and all the cares where for my friend:i was considered like a ghost-nobody i was unconsistant, i had the feelings to be transparent, i had no the statut of friends of but the statut of transparency...i do a sign, i give my credit card but nothing in the eyes of the staff for me...ok i don t have to be jealous, not fun anyway:i am not the companion award or worse",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent but for the first unattentive for the 2d,

"Decided to give HFC a shot after a friend suggested to me this hotel. The room was beautiful and I had a lovely 2 night staycation there. Minor issue was with the phone in the room, as I couldn't for the life of me get it to work, so I had to rely on using the one in the toilet to make calls (and funny enough, order IRD). Other than that everything was great, and the room service food was presented really nicely as well. ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Staycation,
"I got to stay for a few days during my business trip. It is on the top of a hill and there is nothing in walking distance so you'd need a vehicle. Taxis task a while to come by.

"Hotel Fort Canning is a great place to stay in Singapore. The swimming pool is fabulous! The rooms are spacious and clean, although it can be 3pm in the afternoon before your room is serviced. However the cleaners offer a first class service and are so polite and very helpful. Breakfast has something for everyone, eggs cooked to order, British and American fayre as well as local cuisine, it's fab. At 6pm complimentary wine , fruit juice and appetisers are available free of charge. The hotel weren't able to offer a late checkout but did permit us to shower in the spa area before our long flight home. This hotel was an absolute pleasure to stay in with polite, courteous staff. I really couldn't fault it and would definitely staff again.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A Great Place to Stay,
"Very good stay overall.  The room was a pretty deluxe room, high ceiling & bathroom was a spacious and pretty one with a spacious bathtub.   Check in time was 2pm. I arrived later, about 3pm. The hotel staff was friendly, but also, they told me to wait 10-15mins for the room to be ""thoroughly ready"", they said the room is already cleaned, but need to be checked once more. After 15mins, it still wasn't done. I finally got to my room only at about 4-4.15pm. The hotel staff was nice to bring us to the room.   The hotel was very kind to present me with birthday cake and birthday wishes. It was a really sweet gesture.   Check out process was rather smooth.   Thank you Hotel Fort Canning for the great stay, it could've been wonderful if the check in did not take so long. ",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Good stay, pretty room",
"Tucked away in the charming Fort Canning Park this hotel used to be the British Military headquarters in Singapore before being occupied by the Japanese army and then then the Singapore military HQ.   It is a charming personal hotel that has been very tastefully renovated representing good value for money.   The well restored architecture, boutique nature of this hotel and the surrounding gardens of Fort Canning Park make this hotel special.   Highly recommended ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A secret gem,
"Stayed 2 nights in Prem Lux room via a late booking special - large room & very comfortable. The building and friendly staff makes it feel more like a large B&B rather than a city hotel, with an open, green peacful park location, but close to MRT.  Living in Jakarta for +15yrs, we travel frequently to Singapore, and this hotel is now our favourite. Though be aware it is a short climb, up a road & stairs, from the MRT to the hotel.  Also, bathroom lighting not good for shaving & makeup.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A quality oasis in the middle of the city,
"Had a 2 nights staycation with my fiance, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The open-concept bathtub idea was great - good for soaking in with your partner whilst watching tv. The only grip was the ""special garden"", which we assumed will be exclusive to us, fully intimate. However, public could walk pass the other side of the garden, with minimal planters obstructing their peek into our garden. Plus, the rooms beside ours could look into our garden. It will be awesome if we can have the whole garden to ourselves, with no fear that we will be seen by the public. Other than that, the staffs were nice - we asked for a universal adapter and lots of water bottles during our stay to stay hydrated. ",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Warm hospitality received,
"I'm originally from Singapore but live in the US now.  Whenever I visit Singapore, if I'm not staying with family, I'll stay at Hotel Fort Canning.  It's tucked away from the bustle, and I love the quaint colonial decor - high ceilings, plantation shutters etc.  Each room also comes with a full bathtub. In fact the bathroom is one of the best features of the room.  The only negatives is that there isn't really a restaurant or a bar, and it's a small hike to the metro station.  But if you're looking for some quiet time/space, this is the perfect place for you.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,One of my favorite boutique hotels,
"Ambience was quiet and relax for a staycation. Love the rooms with high ceiling. The only missing thing in the room was an alarm clock.

"The ambience was quiet, and relaxing. Breakfast spread limited, but has the essentials with Asian spread. Due to weather, did not try out the pool. Stayed in garden room, and was felt the whole bathroom/toilet concept puzzling and not practical for families. Bathroom/Toilet doors are translucent and the area within the sleeping area bound to get wet given the small size. Not the best of stay but not disappointing either. The customer service was good though, especially from the personnel that attended to us.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet Ambience,
"Stayed in their junior suite but was rather disappointed. The bed in the room was not a king size and was literally combined using 2 single beds. My wife and i could feel the gap between the 2 single beds opening up during our sleep. Also, there was no bathrobe provided in the wardrobe and we could not put on immediately after shower.  Was looking forward to their breakfast but there was a power trip/failure resulting in the chef not being able to cook anything for us.   However, the staffs are very helpful and attended well to our needs. But more could be improved for the room based on the points above.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Disappointing room but excellent service,
"Had a staycation with friends over the weekend in the deluxe room. Was on a lower floor but the view was unique nonetheless. Room size was ideal with a comfortable bed, a sofa as well as a unique bathroom overlooking the city. The entire hotel has a modern and comfortable feel.  The room doors were not very sound proof as I could hear the television/music as I walked along the corridor. Was a little troublesome when I had to use the washroom during my swim because there were no washroom located by the pool and I had to walk back to my room.   Nonetheless, a good stay and will consider coming back.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Comfortable Staycation,
"A good size room, i really like the character of the building too.  The staff were very accommodating, opening the gym for me late in the evening, and making breakfast when the hours had finished.  The only thing i would mention is that as a business traveller and used to staying in hotels, is that it would be good to offer an all night in room dining service. I was on UK time and staying for a night, so by the time i was hungry it was too late for in- room dining and i had to eat peanuts and chocolate from the minibar! It would be good if there was even a small menu available.  But, other than that small thing, the hotel was great.  The pools were also lovely.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great Hotel- Very friendly & helpful staff,
"I truly enjoyed my stay here. I wish I stayed longer. Service was amazing and they even got me a birthday cake since I stayed there during my birthday but did not specifically inform them of it. It was a nice initiative on the hotel's part. Daily evening refreshments include wines and sparkling wine with finger food. Its location is also very good, being next to Fort Canning Park, which is a nice place to walk around. It's also close enough to the MRT station and bus access. The room was state-of-the-art. Definitely a nice place for a staycation as well. I hope to come back to this hotel some time soon.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful hotel in the park,

Surrounded by nice gardens with a great view of MBS from the flagstaff.  The room was very comfortable with a great view from the bathroom. Staff were very helpful.  We had booked breakfast for two mornings but only required it for one as our flights were leaving too early, they would not offer a refund but they did supply breakfast to our room with fruit and pastries.  Toast was also provided but no condiments were supplied, so we didn't eat our cold toast.  We appreciate the effort but it was not good enough for what we paid, this was the only let down.

This is a truly wonderful hotel set in a beautiful park but only a short stroll from Orchard road. A mixture of old colonial feel and Singaporean culture is to be found in this hotel. I found the rooms clean and spacious with modern touches to make your stay delightful. Dinning was a bit quirky everything from pizza to filet mignon served in a bright noisy surroundings. This is not a criticism as we found this in most restaurants in Singapore. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive and helpful. I'd have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. ,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,40th Wedding Anniversary visit,

"Love everything about this hotel. the only pain point happened when i was led into the room by a service staff. she was trying to show me the different amenities in the room, and how to operate the TV etc , which was really thoughtful! However, she had her shoes on and basically walked around the whole room without taking them off. later she realized the tv controller was not working so she got a technician to come fix it, and likewise he walked around the room without removing his shoes.   through 1 day stay, i floor felt very dusty and i was quite disturbed by it. but overall, great hotel!  will definitely be back again",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Love the hotel,

"I came to Singapore to attend my friend's wedding which took place in Hotel Fort Canning.  It is a very nice hotel with comfortable and bright room.  The staff are all very helpful.  Guests can enjoy free happy hour drinks and snacks at the private lounge from 6pm to 7pm.   Hotel guests have chance to mingle and relax.   I think this is a very good arrangement.   The only slight improvement needed is the bathroom, for some reasons, water always come out after shower, probably because of the gap in the glass door.     It is not a big deal and I didn't even informed the hotel.  Other than that, all facilities are very well managed.   I'll choose this hotel again in my next visit to Singapore.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice Hotel,
Enjoyed my stay with very friendly and polite hotel staff all around! Room was spacious and I did not even need the lift as the stairs made going to the lobby or restaurant so convenient.

Highlight would definitely be the rooms.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Good experience,

Taking a 100% holding deposit, but when you check out, they cancel that and then re-debit again.  This is the first and last impression of the hotel, and it is a poor one.  They need to sort this out and get modern software.  It should be a 30 second process in and out.  Also the hotel is noisy as there is no sound-proofing through the doors.

"The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant was very nice, average price but small portions.  We had the Garden Room, and the toilet setup is pretty weird. The door doubles as a door for the shower, so you can only have one closed at the same time, and the partially frosted glass door doesn't give much privacy. Other people I know stayed in other rooms and didn't have this issue.  WE stayed for a 2 day conference in the hotel and I was very impressed by the consistently great service by ALL staff members, especially during the lunch and coffee breaks of the conference.  A large shopping mall is a 5 min walk away as well as a MRT station.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Very Friendly and attentive staff, nice environment.",
"The hotel is centrally located in Fort Canning park, within walking/short cab distance to Clarke Quay.

"My husband and I stayed here for two nights. This is a beautiful hotel. The park which surrounds it is absolutely beautiful. The staff is great, great location: 15 min walk to Orchard street and 20/25 minute walkNice clean room. No mold in shower.   The water press was good, not great. My only issue with this wonderful hotel is the fact that the room temp only goes down to 23 degrees and with the high humidity, it matters. We would  absolutely stay here again in cooler months",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Loved it,

"Exceptional hotel Finished off a five week trip with a stay for 3 days at this hotel.  What can I say from start to finish the hotel and its team exceeded our expectations .  Met with a warm friendly welcome from the very professional team on reception.  Complimentary drinks and canopies each evening were an unexpected surprise.  The hotel room was very beautiful with everything fully controllable from the TVs. As we had two single beds it was comfortable,  the space is dictated by the original architecture of this beautiful building.  Fort canning hotel is an oasis of calm in the heat and bustle of Singapore .  Would recommend to anyone who asked ",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Oasis of calm ,
"Having visited Singapore a few times over the years, this hotel was a gem of a find. Good but not great location if sightseeing, particularly for elderly or disabled as is on a hill with limited access. However we were there for a relaxing break and fitted that perfectly, great rooms, bathrooms stunning, but no bath robes and very hard to hang 2 towels, pools excellent although lack of shaded area, tough on those days the sun really shines. Restaurant and bar all offered great service and range, the cocktail reception hour a great service and throwback to the colonial era, in the perfect setting.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet Haven in Busy City,
"Was housed at Studio room at a level up from staircase. Everything was well till before sleep as unfortunately it seems to have wedding reception and staffs mentioned it will ceased by 10/11pm. However, the noise continue till almost 12am as it seems that we are surrounded by guest attending the reception and they are staying at the rooms around us too.  Ultimately, bed is comfortable, nice bathroom and huge space. Room is well-appointed with everything amenities you can expect from a 5* hotel. The overall experience is above expectation.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Unique Location, Great stay just small hiccup",
"We have visited Singapore a number of times and have stayed in a few different areas. We really liked it here. It is very central, and not far to walk to Orchard Road and Clarke Quay - just be prepared for hills and stairs, but it is a nice walk in the park. The rooms are good and the history of the hotel makes it unique. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The best part was it really felt like an oasis in the city. It was so nice to return here in amongst the gardens after a busy day sightseeing. We would stay here again and wished we had more time to explore the grounds.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Unique place to stay,

"My partner and I have enjoyed our stay with Hotel Fort Canning. The Deluxe Garden Room is spacious and clean and we love the open concept bathtub. There is effective communication between the receptionist and the kitchen. Our dietary needs were catered for at the complimentary evening drinks session as well as breakfast. However, as there was cheese in our evening complimentary snack, there might still be a lack of understanding towards a vegan diet which do not comprise egg and milk. Overall, we are still very satisfied with the service!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Effort was made to cater to our vegan diet.,

5 Star Hotel NEARLY worthy of all 5 stars. Experience overall was exquisite. Staff were friendly and very welcoming. Only exception where they may need some work is in cleanliness. There were some downers in the washroom that I was not too excited about but I was able to overlook that as compared to many other hotels throughout Asia Hotel Fort Canning was already beyond expectations. We utilized uber throughout the stay to get in and out of the property as it was situated in the middle of historic Fort Canning Park and due to the hot humid weather it was not a gentle walk.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Relaxing Couples Stay,
Fabulous colonial style hotel set amongst the trees on the hill  above Clarke Quay.  The look and feel of the place relaxed us from day one and the hotel staff gave excellent service with nothing too much trouble.

This hotel is for you if you appreciate:  A hotel that is not a hive of hustle and bustle A hotel that has style without pretension A building that is distinctive and period in architecture And surrounded by parkland Lovely pools Courteous staff who QUIETLY carry out their duties with courtesy Lovely breakfasts Sensibly priced restaurant and room service meals  I could go on.  This is the best hotel we have found in Singapore in twelve years of visiting.  So relaxing.  We were totally at ease here and hope one day to return.  I must mention Amy who represents the hotel to guests and who was so interesting to talk to and who was so keen to guage our feedback.  Another gem!,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A delightful gem.

"Excellent hotel within easy reach of MRT, attractions and shops. A country house or hill station oriented hotel with oddles of charm and comfort. Food was lovely.

Loved it.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A little piece of quiet tranquility in a very busy city,
"The Fort Canning offered so many advantages than other hotels we have stayed at in Singapore.  It is a beautifully restored historic building.  The room was very large and the bathroom (with a big bath & shower) was huge in comparison to others. It is within easy walking distance to Dhoby Ghaut MRT with connections to 3 lines and Orchid Street main shopping district. The buffet breakfast was great value and the dinners were excellent and not expensive.  We will go back next time in Singapore, no question.  Do yourself a favour!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Highly recommeded,
"We chose this hotel for a staycation due to its location within nature but yet so close to the city! It is only 10 mins walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT and malls! The room is clean and we had a good rest on the comfy beds. The deep soaking tub made us so relaxed and while brushing our teeth, we could enjoy the city view right in front of us. We also love the high ceiling of the room and the mirrored wardrobe. The pool is great as it does not have the smell of chlorine.  Signages were not so clear and layout of the buidling is a little confusing. You need to push the room door after tapping the room card, which feels a little odd. The wifi is a little hassle as you have to log in each time you enter the room. Will be good if bathrobes were provided.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nature enclave within the city!,

"We had booked the hotel to celebrate a special occasion and the hotel had given us a free upgrade! So that really made a great first impression. We were also allowed to check in about 1.5 hours before official check-in time at 2 pm. Room was beautiful, especially the huge bathtub.  From 6-7 pm we were given complimentary drinks and canopies. However their selection was highly limited to one type of red and white wine. And the food was too little that we didn't even get to try some as they were finished as soon as they were put out. The selection of food was limited to just a few types as well, this compared to other hotel lounge odurves.  Breakfast spread was a little limited too, but still we received.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great stay!,
"Fort Canning was an incredibly important place throughout history especially in WW2. Now it is a lovely hotel in an unbeatable location, hard to believe in busy Singapore. The staff are very good, especially a young man called Kelson Yeo. He is a very smart young man with very high standards, he certainly helped us enjoy our Singapore stay a great deal. It's unlikely that you'll have problems there, if you do - Kelson's your man.

Weather forecast shows raining throughout the week. I wanted a day stay and a seperate bathroom away from the room for a change and this is what I am looking for. I made the request online through booking.com (I used both tripadvisor and booking.com) for a third level quiet room as I am here to retreat. The bathtub was big enough for me to relax and they provide complimentary magazines. Excellent service in hotel from room service to the man who greet you at the entrance. I give a four star as there is a carpet smell along the door way (I am allergic to carpet) overall great for value and great stay. The breakfast was good! ,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great stay.

With all the ultra-modern hotels you're spoilt for choice in Singapore but Hotel Fort Canning offers you a bit of old-world colonial charm with an ultra-modern twist.

Overall we had a great stay & I would recommend this hotel.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice colonial hotel,

"First off,  it's not cheap,  but for a special night or two away it's well worth it.  The building is stunning and well maintained so it does feel luxurious.  Nice little touches like free wine,  champagne etc at certain times. Our room was great with an exceptional bathroom.  The floor to ceiling window overlooking the park was a little unnerving at first,  but they do have blinds of course.  Definitely one for couples to enjoy,  large comfortable bed,  excellent unquestioning service, Good pool,  and the surroundings are parkland in the heart of of the city...  You would never know.

The hotel is a bit dated but still retaining the old British charm. The rooms are nicely appointed but without the WOW factor.  The happy hour is provided near the front desk area and is not so happy at all. It's a self serve corner with a couple of wine bottles and fruit cocktails. Service is excellent and it's what makes this hotel extra special. In all, I I'll give it 3 out of 5 stars. ",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"British Legacy, but",

Plus: great rooms, very good room style and architecture, fantastic location, boutique style service and approach, splendid service, great in house Italian restaurant. A small oasis close to busy and noisy orchard road  Minus: can take up to 15' to get a taxi on spot so leave earlier for your destination.  For some the fact it's somehow isolated can be an issue, I personally was looking for exactly that.  Definitely recommend and good value for money.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A small oasis in the city,
"If you are on foot... beware. This exceptional hotel is on a hill. The stairs are a bit treacherous and steep and are much worse when it rains.  Very welcoming staff but know much about the surrounding area. The usual answer about the area was 'I'm not from around here'. Just so you know... Clarke Quay is a 15 minute walk from the hotel.

It had a romantic feel to it and the lobby was very elegant and chic.  Unfortunately, I was met with a musty smell once I stepped into the room. It was also very humid in the room and did not had the 5 star standard that I was hoping for. I had a room on the first floor and there was no view. Definitely not recommended for a romantic getaway.  The restaurant was also small but the food was good. Staff were attentive and courteous.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Musty room spoils it all,

"Hotel Fort Canning is a quiet hotel in a renovated colonial building in Fort Canning Park - a green Oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  It is within walking distance of the subway and the retail area.  Room are comfortable and larger than average.  The only quirky aspect is erratic water pressure in the shower.  As a smaller hotel the concierge service is limited, although the staff always try to be helpful.  While the hotel is full of character and the swimming pools are excellent, the downside of the quiet surrounds is the need to walk 5 to 10 minutes down to the subway and the retail area.  Not so bad on the way down, but it can be more of a challenge on the way back up the hill in the heat and humidity of Singapore.  We would stay there again if visiting Singapore.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet Hotel in a park in busy Singapore,

This is not luxe but a reasonable 3.5 to 4 star hotel in a good location.  Rooms are decent size and good layout.  Reduce your expectations, this is not luxury but it's an ok hotel in a central part of Singapore, easy walk to Clarke and Boat Quays.  Good pool but minimal outdoor furniture and no bar service.  The gym is good but entrance feels subterranean damp.  It's a more interesting location than, say, staying on Orchard Road but it needs decorating and staff need better training; their directions to local attractions were woeful.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Great location, but fairly tired decor, lax staff",

"Booked a deluxe patio. Room was big, especially with the patio extension outdoors on the ground level. However, the patio didn't offer much privacy. Perhaps, should surround the patio with taller trees.   Staff was very kind to lead us to the room and explained several functions in the room. I felt the functions were a little too high-tech. Too many lights, though it was nice. Requested for a DVD player, but if I wanted to watch normal TV, I had to call the reception for them to unplug the wires for me, too troublesome.   The room was nice, but the shower room had a flaw - water could easily flow out from the gap, causing that portion of the room to be wet.   Overall, nice and historic hotel.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Deluxe Patio,

In consequence, if you lower the electronic curtains (to use the toilet),all dailight is gone. The two pools are wonderful. We didnt have breakfast because we preferred the Kith Cafe which is located 3 minutes downs the hill.

This hotel left a bad taste when I was informed at checking out that it would take 3 WEEKS for them to refund the $300 deposit they demanded at check in.  Really?

"Nestled on a small hill just a stone's throw away from the night scene of Clark Quay in Singapore, this hotel was refurbished with modern classy interior. (Even a touch panel sliding door that leads to the washroom) With only a few floors and limited rooms, you need not worry about having your peace disturbed.  However for its price, I think the establishment could really do much better with its limited cable channels. Hotel Fort Canning is really a place to enjoy on its own using their facilities, at added prices of course. Could also use more space for a writing table to work on. I would rate this a 3.5 overall.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Place of Solace,

"My friend stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and it was a very pleasant stay.  The rooms, tho large enough for only 2 persons max, were comfortable and well appointed.   The hotel is tucked in a lovely hill and public garden, but still very much in the heart of the city.  Public transportation is a bit inconvenient and one has to use a cab to get to and from the hotel to any destination.   It is an excellent alternative accommodation to the typical corporate traveller and it may not appeal to the leisure visitor.   In-room dining offered a good selection of delicious local & western foods.   The Nespresso machine in the room made it very convenient to have a good cup of coffee without having to order it from Room Service",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful hotel tucked away in Singapore's greenery,
"One of the best staycation we ever had! The service was excellent, checked in and out was a breeze and smiley staff made our day! We were thrilled when we stepped in to our room. Very unique layout with the toilet and bath facing the garden. We were on the 2nd floor so we didn't feel the lack of privacy. The thing my husband enjoyed the most was their free flow of prosecco, wine and canapes between 6-7pm, very nice gesture from the hotel! Breakfast was semi-buffet which we enjoyed thoroughly. Location of the hotel is not as inconvenient as we thought. From the carpark to Parkmall, it's just a 5-10 mins walk. Though location is in the middle of the city, we felt that we were overseas! We will definitely be back again to this lovely hotel!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Absolutely Gorgeous!!,
"Hotel is in a good location, very central. Located in beautiful park area. Check in not very efficient, staff member spent a lot of time on phone for private issues.  The rooms are average in space, bathrooms however exceptionally large and modern. Rooms are well equipped, bed is very comfortable. Generally the rooms need a touch up, as they are a bit tatty and worn  Pool area and other amenities are in a good state and of good quality.  Food from a la carte is good, breakfast recommended.   Hotel has no kids facility, kids menu etc.  All in all the hotel needs at least a touch up, or even a renovation. The facilities are a little worn down and tatty.

"Stayed for a week on business and was very well looked after.  Pools are amazing.. I do a lot of swimming and those pools are probably the clearest I've ever swum in, just magic. Gym is also very well equipped.  Breakfast doesn't start until 7 so if you have an early start plan for breakfast somewhere else.  If I was going to be picky I was in a downstairs room and the internal door to the next room was not very soundproof but a minor issue.

"I love returning to the Hotel Fort Canning. Situated on a hill surrounded by beautiful jungle/park landscaping - quite apart, yet within close walking distance to shopping and restaurants the historic hotel features a great nostalgic ambience reminding of Singapore's colonial past. Rooms are generally well appointed, many with stunning hill-top views onto the city; great facilities for sports (walking/jogging walkways in the park surrounding the hotel; a very nice lap-swimming pool; gym facilities). Only disappointments were (1) breakfast dining - with rather disappointing (3*-calibre at best) selection/offering and level of service, and (2) Wifi (free) which turned out to be unstable and spotty at times. Can nonetheless recommend this hotel.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great ambience; recommended,

"We had a short stay in this hotel and were disappointed with the poor service. For example on the first evening my daughter's first choice of cocktail was not available and the second took over 20 minutes to be brought; housekeeping only made up our rooms after 4pm despite the fact that we had been out since 8.30am; at breakfast we had to hunt for some one to take an order; the concierge desk was often unmanned, and so on. We put it down to a lack of any visible manager. The rooms were fine but they were replacing the wall paper in the passages and we had to clamber over this on our way to our rooms on arrival which was not a great start. In all I don't think this hotel was value for money.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Poor service,

"I stayed at the HFC because i was attending a conference which was held on-site. From start to finish HFC provided superior service. Check-in was breeze, the room was stunning. In fact I loved the bathroom so much i decided to replicate it in my own home. Food was good though somewhat overpriced. The pool was the perfect temperature this June and the quiet nights made for the perfect business trip. There is a lovely park to walk through just behind the hotel and if you want to eat some authentic food, there are some lovely restaurants just 5 minutes walk away.

Staff were very helpful and friendly and the grounds are well kept.  Gym was one of the best I've been to in a hotel with modern equipment and a good blend of machines. Buffet breakfast had a great selection and the food was fresh and well presented. Would definitely recommend if you want a hotel that's in the heart of Singapore yet has a secluded feel due to its raised location and tropical grounds. Close enough to walk to Orchard or a 5 minute taxi ride.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent,
"Although I agree with some of the other comments about the small size of the room and the 'soaking' of the bathroom floor; overall I loved my stay at Hotel Fort Canning. The bathroom is large and amenities were very nice. In regards to the floor getting wet, I would put a towel down. It resolves the issue and is common sense? The room was very nice - small but not crowded. The hotel staff were very helpful, welcoming and friendly. I loved the pool, however, the cushions were a bit damp so make sure to bring your own towels. The hotel is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is the only one in Singapore like this. It is in a fantastic location, as it is very close to Orchard Rd. I would highly recommend staying here for the location and excellent customer service.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful location and fantastic staff,

Visited this hotel on a very hot & humid Saturday to see if it was worth changing from my present hotel of choice in Singapore. Was charged  $35 for 2 very small draught beers. .Maybe our present hotel is a bargain ,3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful hotel but expensive,
Our room has nice greenery view and the room is spacious enough. Its quite a luxurious hotel. Service is good and you have your own privacy. Its worth the price if you are looking for a luxury resort feel hotel which is in town area. But you might need to walk quite a distance to the nearest MRT.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet and Relaxing,
"This is the 4th time that I have stayed at the hotel and the experience is as unique as the other 3 occasions. The staff are courteous and friendly. From the concierge, porters and security officers. Never failing to greet you. One of the older hotel staff even remembered us even though its been quite a while since we stayed. The best part of the stay for me is the aperitif hour from 6pm to 7pm. Its a nice thing that I have not seen in any other hotels. The rooms are clean and well maintained. I look forward to a 5th visit there.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A nice place for a weekend getaway,
"Staff were attentive, friendly and polite though service was a little slow. Sadly the food was disappointing, no sandwiches , scones , sponge cake etc . Limited selection and the final insult was serving frozen cream Swiss rolls! It felt like it had been thrown together from leftovers. This does not reflect on the overall service provision which otherwise appears good.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,High tea disappointment,

"Spent two nights in this luxurious hotel to de-stress.Fortunately was not disappointed.  The room is a beauty-expansive windows,comfortable bed, marble-clad bathroom with designer sanitary fittings and sufficient task lighting.The service during the breakfast and complimentary drink hours is impeccable.  But to me, it is the seclusion of the hotel that won me over- what better place to relax by the pool (there are two here) and have lazy gins and tonics in your soundproof glass-enclosed balcony in the evening!  Felt fully re-charged and will be back.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A beautiful hotel with inspiring interiors,

No sofa/lounger as shown on website. Very tight walking space after opening our 2 luggages on the floor (no luggage stand provided). Space between bed and wardrobe was only half meter, so only 1 person accessed wardrobe at 1 time. Mattress was too soft for my personal preference The washbasin mirror is a small round mirror and small counter space. Inconvenient for applying makeup / styling hair.  Only rainshower choice was available. Uncomfortable showering for those who do not want to wet hair.

"We had 3 nights at HFC and it is a beautiful hotel,  set in Fort Canning Park in a historic building that has been renovated into a classy hotel with understated elegance.  The bathrooms are a bit quirky and better for couples and singles rather than friends traveling together.   It is about 5 minute walk to Dauby Ghout MRT station and is an easy walk to Orchard Road.  The staff are all super friendly and helpful and there are 3 beautiful pools.  I loved our stay at HFC and would happily stay again!   Thank you for your hospitality!",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,gorgeous oasis in the middle of Singapore,
"I stayed at this hotel during the 1st week of Feb.  The decor & layout of the suites, & the fact that a soak in my Fort Canning hill facing bathtub would keep me a captive audience of squirrels at play... with the occasional hummingbird & eagle in flight- are good enough reason to choose this hotel for a staycation.  But, there are other strengths to this hotel as well : I'd rave on stellar staff- Dinesh from the restaurant. His service is close to perfect. ... Plus, the depth of passion this hotel's team has for both the hotel & their job shows. They quickly put to satisfaction every request or complaint raised.

The renovation of a heritage building was done with such respect. I think they have only a few dozen rooms but what rooms! High ceilings, beautiful furnishing and a bathroom located in what was once the terrace! Terrific service. Wonderful food. And complimentary wine and finger food for ALL guests in the afternoons.

"Except for the absence of both the doorman and the receptionist at our arrival, we have nothing to report but good news. Modern rooms, good internet, extended breakfast buffet, happy hour (18-19h) and attentive staff. The maybe deceptive issue here is that one would expect a garden around the premises, but there is only the public Canning Hill. So the outdoor terrace is tiny if not petite and the larger terrace is occupied by what looked like a permanent tent for festivities of all sorts.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,great location without garden,

We were surprised this hotel wasn't totally booked - only a few minute walk to transportation.  Restaurant has good food (try pizza and pasta) and is very reasonably priced.

It was tough for me to believe that the quiet, peaceful hotel was in the heart of Singapore. While the hotel lacked the grandeur of many other ""chain"" hotels it made up for it in the personal space - The pools were almost always empty and readily accessible and so was the coffee shop. To add to the beauty the hotel had evening wine and snacks on the house.

"We stayed 6 nights at Hotel Fort Canning in February, a beautifully appointed historic building set in an oasis-like park in the very centre of the city - and will stay there again on any future visits to Singapore. Staff are outstanding - friendly and very helpful, the decor is extremely stylish, the rooms are beautifully appointed and the building - the former British military HQ - is imposingly grand. As we were visiting, in part, for a WW2 commemoration service, nowhere could have been more appropriate. Excellent breakfast (see other reviews) and dinner was also very good - so good, we became too lazy to explore restaurants in the town. The only point to note is that the peaceful location is out of the buzz of the centre - a trade-off we were happy to make.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Holiday in history,

Far too many electronic gadgets for apeaceful skeep the room was buzzing with electro magnetic radaition The bathroom could be seen by joggers opposite on jingle jogging track so we needed to close the blinds wach time we used the bathroom.

The rooms  big and spacious are well appointed with an ante room and separate bathroom. The staff at reception and the Glasshouse  are extremely friendly and helpful and remembered us from the previous year and made us feel most welcome. Their service was outstanding.

The hotel is set in acres of parkland that provide a peaceful tranquil atmosphere and is short walking distance from the MRT line or Clarke Quay. Who would know you were in the heart of the city.

Stayed here for 4 days for business. There is a gap between hard ware and soft ware in this place. Rooms are modern and well equiped. Good sleeping quality aprt from ac which is a little bit noisy. Good restaurtant and some dishes a good value for money which is difficult to find in Singapore. Staff is a different story. It was hard to find a person when I checked in close to midnight (have to look after by luggage by myself) When I checked out I tried to make a reservation for the coming week. It was not possible.

The ceiling was very high and the nook with the desk and comfy egg like sofa felt precious and lovely.  Swimming pools were full lengths and quite empty which meant I got to swim and splash for a jolly long time alone.  Food however was only ok. The local selection was delicious but the steak I ordered had a fishy taste which meant that it was prepared w a fish dish and tasted like it was frozen meat.

We're in a bigger room, but the lay out is awful, bed's in the centre of the room surrounded by wasted space. Bed is very comfortable with decent bedding. The premium toiletries are generic, and not very nice, again will go and buy my own today. The room has tons of mirrors and the naturally dark room's lighting is not very pleasant.

The first room that I was provided has a musty smell, the staff promptly switched me to another room which felt much better. The city view room was nice. Rooms are clean and decorated with very modern furniture and fixtures. The evening drinks was a nice surprise considering they provided a good selection of alcohol for free.

"We were attending Hostess weekender at Fort Canning so this hotel was super convenient.  Hotel rooms are small but well designed, we had a room with a terrace which was great.  The location is fantastic, in the middle of the Botanical gardens so there is no traffic noise and relaxing by the pool is very nice, it is also a short walk to a lot of great Singapore attractions including art galleries and decent cafes and restaurants.

The porter & desk staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely stay there again.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A very nice hotel.,
"We stayed for 3 nights at end of Jan.2014.  Quiet , extremely clean with awesome helpful staff. Was an old historical bldg converted to a hotel. The bathrooms were added to where the balcony's used to be, as such  the views are from your bathroom. Quirky but effective. Located up the hill from major streets so if lots of steps are not your thing beware. For the price this hotel is a great buy for the offering.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Quiet Boutique Hotel,
"we were very negatively surprised. the main entrance feels like a low ceiling garage entrance with pipes on the ceiling, see attached picture, everything is at extra charge. zero amiability. Breakfast would be acceptable for a three star hotel but surely not for a five star and surely not at extra cost.  we were forced to take breakfast also the second morning because ""prebooked"".  cash money advance at 20% surcharge, taxi to airport for 110 while taxi gets 60 SGD. light system extremely annoying. 3 cm stumple steps in bathroom, water not always reliable hot. walk outside to get into elevators, walk outside and past functional tents, to get to breakfast. This building should be a clubhouse, not a hotel. we advised a friend to cancel his booking and go to Mandarin Oriental",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,not five star,

Cons: 1) Afternoon tea and evening cocktails are literally just choices of tea, coffee, wine, and one cocktail. That's it. I know it's a botique hotel but since it was festive season I guess I expected more. 2) Blant breakfast and limited choices.  Pros: 1) Pool.

"My girlfriends and I decided to have a bridal shower gathering cum staycation at Hotel Fort Canning over the weekend. The hotel was idyllic, in the midst of lush greenery and away from the busy city area. It really felt like we were out of Singapore as it was really quaint and quiet. We loved the spacious and comfortable room, especially the beautiful open concept bathroom. The room controls were really high tech. All in all, we had a great stay. However, I felt that the hotel staff were not friendly. They were not smiley, nor welcoming. I think this is really an important factor for a hotel. I hope someone will look into this because it's a pity if this small BUT important issue takes away from a customer's overall experience.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,No smiles at Hotel Fort Canning,
"Just spent a week in Singapore staying at Hotel Fort Canning in Singapore. The deluxe room was a good size for a couple and reasonably well appointed. The ambience and decor of the hotel was charming and new and well integrated with the heritage look and feel of the building. The location is brilliant, set in the historic Fort Canning park, and only 5-10mins walk from the CBD. The biggest reason to stay here is the excellent service. The team at the front desk, the lobby bar and the GlassHouse restaurant are first class and can't be helpful enough. A big thanks to Ganga and his team for making my stay a real pleasure.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Service Excellence,
The room is very nice and spacious. Not the usual arrangement. The bed was very comfy and bathroom really spacious with a good open concept with overlooking glass.  Complimentary evening cocktail not fantastic at all. Been to hotels where  they provide other other alcoholic beverages but for this they only provides wines. There were also not enough glasses to go around.  Breakfast is decent. Not much variety of choices but the staffs was really sincere in providing service. Even the chef who manned the omellete sraying go out of his way to talk and bring your order to the table.  Checkin checkout was fast and hassle free.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Not too bad,
"We stayed here for 4 nights over Christmas. It's located in a park and is different (yet good) setting that what we normally stay in at Singapore, lots of greenery. Location was awesome as it is walking distance to Clark Quay, Orchard Rd and MRT. Rooms are a really good size and nice decor, beds were comfortable. Room service was a little slow, but food was nice. I thought the breakfast was average (food was luke warm or cold). Probably only the real negative is that communication seem to be a problem. Usually we have no problem communicating in English in Singapore but it was a struggle in this hotel, from reception staff to restaurant staff, but we are used to staying in international brand hotels and this is not one. Overall a good trip and the price is reasonable.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Good value, amazing location.",

Then, I was put in a room that had an adjoining room.  The noise next door was terrible and very loud.  Then, I had to check out late and they assured me that I would  be charged a full extra day.  When I returned to my room after the last work day, it hadn't even been cleaned!  I was not amused.  When I called the front desk, they told me I didn't tell them I wanted the room cleaned!

However the service in the hotel is not great. The staff do not have the same professional standard as some of the other hotels )mainly chains) for the same price and the lobby and public areas don't function as seamlessly as other hotels.

"This is my second time staying at Fort Canning hotel. The first time was when it first opened. It's a beautiful hotel overall. The landscape, the architecture, the room. The rooms are beautiful but not very practical. I find it difficult to work with the small desk and the WiFi get disconnected often, therefore not good for business trip. It's probably perfect for leisure trip.  The staff are very courteous and trying their best to satisfy customer. But somehow the check in is still not efficient enough.  Unfortunately, my trip was cut short due to family matter. The front desk was kind enough to try and help me get a refund for the rest of the stay. But at the end it didn't get accepted.

Stayed at The Fort Canning again on business for the second time this year.  Good I do like the setting in Fort Canning - surrounded by gardens with zero traffic noise. Broadband in the room is good - but you need to ask for a cable to link to ethernet as it is much faster than wireless which keeps asking you to reconnect or slows. Nasi Goreng delivered to room was quick and very good. Swimming pools are huge and quiet. Doormen are friendly and quick at getting cabs for my many meetings. Roti prata for breakfast and an omlette man who is very keen to make one for you.  Bad It's not quite 5 star - a couple of times there were no towels by the pools or finished room service was not collected for quite a while. Aircon in rooms is really not quiet enough.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Stayed for 5 days for business,

What made up for the small bed room, was the HUGE  marble clad bathroom with tub and rain shower as well as the indoor balcony.   The reception, area had free coffee, tea and biscuits.   The breakfast was sufficient, not an overflowing morning buffet but a conservative array of fruit, yogurt, eggs and pancakes.

Room was good size with desk for working. Position is secluded in Fort Canning with no traffic noise.  Bad Position is secluded - a little wait for taxis sometimes.

"Stayed over for a weekend.   Room was cozy and chic, the full length window that separated the room from the bath room was a nice touch. peering out of the window, you are greeted by a hint of colonial architecture which lends some grandure to the room.  Unfortunately- there were a couple of spoilers. (1) there were feaces stains in the toilet bowl- something I consider wholly unaccpetable, and (2) the drainage for the shower area did not work which almost flooded the bathroom. If the hotel whips their room-cleaning team in shape, the hotel will be much better... Til then, I will only rate it as being ""average"".",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Generally, good.",

"We stayed for a week from the end of Dec 2012 to Jan 2013, were impressed by the building but not by the staff and cleanliness of the hotel. On our first 3 nights we had to ask for towels etc as there was nothing in the bathroom. It was also sad to see that the floors in the common areas were not clean, a mop and bucket would prove useful instead of a dry mop. The bar also does not serve food during the day despite menus being available on the tables. Of greater concern was the storage of rubbish in a position that blocked fire exits on 2 levels and staff were very complacent with no sense of pride in their work. Would not stay in this hotel again.",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Just cannot get it right,
"When we first arrived the check in process was very unfortunate.  In the middle of checking us in, the lady decided that it was the perfect moment to make a phone call and work on other matters.  In addition, another front desk employee continuously interrupted us to ask her own questions.  For the price of the room, the room was quite dirty.

"I tried hard yet failed to notice any significant aspect of this hotel that supposed to make it a great hotel. Location wise, its ok if you don't mind walk up and down hill. The level of service is perhaps the most jarring disappointment. Nevermind that the staffs can't even address guests by their name, they are simply nothing much to shout about other than being ignorant & arrogant. If I have to pay that sort of money again, I would have done it just like how we spent our weekend last week.

They even called helped me called for a cab 15mins before I came down as I informed them earlier on that I have another place to go and it was raining cats and dogs outside. Other than that, the Premium room that I booked was better than I expected! Spacious enough for 2 person with a very beautiful study room facing the park. I loved the Nespresso machine and TWG tea!

"Based on my previous nice experience with this hotel, I booked them for a sudden one-nighter. They needed more than two hours to bring an electrical adaptor, gave me a room with malfunctioning bathroom equipment, a badly stained bed sheet and provided a breakfast with unspeakable scrambled eggs. I documented those faults but only got an email saying ""we have forwarded your concerns to the respective departments""  Seems they have started to believe their own propaganda.",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Upsetting,
The staffs who entertained us were Filipinos which gave us a very hospitable impact. Rooms are cleaned every time we come back from the convention we attended. Bottled water and shower amenities are replenished everyday. Good service. A very quiet place. No busy scene as we can only see trees in the park. Bad location I should say as it is not accessible to the main streets. We never had any problems during our stay. There are also no staffs in sight in the hallway. Satisfactory. Tons of reading materials provided in the room.,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A Silent Escape for business travellers.,
"My room was only entitled to 1 breakfast when I booked my room for 2 people.  My room faced a large grey wall which overlooked the park and people passing by could look inside. Where is the privacy? This is ridiculous!. The hotel staffs are also unfriendly and rude. They are also unable to give us a satisfactory answer to our enquiries which is extremely frustrating. One of the staff even asked us to show our pass to verify that we are guests of the hotel, what kind of unreasonable service and attitude this is?",1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Ridiculous,
singapore hotels are as small as it can get.  the size of the room is the only negative point i can think about.  the most important thing about this hotel is the complimentary welcome drink every evening! there is a wide selection of drinks available (red / white / sparkling) coupled with cheese and biscuits to welcome guests.  the location is pretty out of the way (on a hilltop) but the serenity of the location frees the guest from the hectic urban jungle of singapore,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,small room,

"I will not return. Grandly up on a hill, but consequently a long wait for taxis in order to escape. Two restaurants: Glasshouse (Asian and Western) in separate building and in-house Italian with ridiculous wine prices (S$18 for a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc?)  Geared to corporate events more than tourists. Franchisees of a well-known fitness club had a splendid party in a marquee mere feet from my room.

"Had 5 days in Singapore and chose to stay at this historical Hotel Fort Canning, a grand building with a contemporary feel is a rare find, located in a beautiful park central Singapore.   Rooms were large, modern and spotlessly clean.  Front desk were efficient and helpful. Housekeeping very slow with any requests, but not enough to annoy.  Two swimming pools available, which in the Singapore heat is a necessity.  A wonderful touch though was free drinks and nibbles from 6 til 8 every evening!    A short walk to public transport & restaurants through the park, very convenient!  I highly recommend a stay at this lovely piece of calm in the park...",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Gorgeous,
"This place is quite something, and very different from the norm in Singapore. Firstly, the architecture - the building was the home of the British Military, so is very intersting in its layout and the new owners have done wonders with the space. Secondly, the rooms - quite lovely and the bathrooms that look out over the back are brilliant - you'll see why when you stay there. I went on business, but will be taking my wife there one day. It's that good.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful Singapore hotel,
"This hotel is expensive, but you're getting something quite special. The rooms are artistically designed and don't feel like standard hotel rooms. The location is great - quiet and yet central, set in a park and a five minute walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT which is a major interchange. Everything feels new. There are 2 large swimming pools set amongst trees and a gym with new clean equipment. Unlike some hotels,  they don't charge for wireless Internet, and the service is fast and reliable. I found the staff friendly and helpful. I'd definitely visit again.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great character and atmosphere,

"Very nice colonial hotel in the heart of Singaport.  Close to all the places you need to be yet removed enough to relax in too.   Not cheap by any means but that's not why you stay there.   Some of the staff need a few more points in their EQ and the 'standard room could be a little better for the money.   Free wifi, great wine list and a wonderful setting make up for that and more.     Not perfect, expensive but it's very hard to be disappointed by this place.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Tranquility in the heart of a fave bustling city,

The location is perfect, you can go by foot to Marina Bay in about 10-15 minutes; the hotel is located on a green hill ( a rare site in Singapore) and it is surrounded by a lot of vegetation.

I like the room but the only weird for me was the bath tub near the bed. The coffee maker and the water heater in my room was broken. called the front desk but they didn't do anything.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice stays,
I'm a nature lover so i decided to give this hotel a try. Taxi drivers don't know where this hotel is. Staffs busy chatting and like previous reviewer mentioned service is very much lacking. They need re-training urgently. Unpleasant and clearly bored with their jobs. My room looked different compared to what i saw on their website. When questioned staff was not interested to explain. Room had bugs in them. Breakfast was lousy. Lucky i did not have to spend another night there. I will never stay here again.,1.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Horrified,
"We had our honeymoon at this hotel and absolutely loved it. It was clearly very new and had been beautiful designed. The bathrooms are unusually appointed with sweeping views over the gardens (rather than having a window in the bedroom), but were stunning.  The botanic gardens setting at Fort Canning was an absolute delight and gave the hotel a real oasis feel.  Breakfast wasn't hugely extensive compared to other parts of Asia but was nice and did the job.

No service in this hotel. No one helps you with the luggages. No one shows the direction to your room. No one answers the phone when you call from your room. No one cleans your room.

"First impressions of the hotel are great. Wonderful modernisation, nice room with fancy bathroom, views, good public areas and free drinks are a nice touch. Service is a somewhat lacking - don't expect any at all if you are at the pool. Staff will walk past with a smile but no one is there to take a drink or food order.

"Have lived in Singapore for many years and the park and building are very nice and decent renovated.   Booked the Park view room, they gave me 2nd floor looking at a grey wall. Changed to a 3rd floor City View Studio. Bigger but not nicer as setting area is very small and narrow, bath in the middle of your bedroom. City & Park view through a very small and narrow window.   Not really expensive (nothing cheap any more in SINGAPORE), but for me not worth it's $!",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Park View could mean Wall view,
"In a city with so many hotels to choose I decided to stay here because the rates were good and I had been recommended by various people to try it out. The hotel is very nice, nice rooms, nice surrounding, historic building etc. The room was well fitted out and modern but it felt very enclosed and ""cell-like"". The shower had a problem with hot water but the batch did not. Unusual layout to the room but that is part of the character of the hotel. Breakfast was included in rate as was wifi internet so good value. Breakfast was a bit of a hit and miss and service was below average for the type of hotel. Location can be a bit of an issue in getting transportation (taxis) and some taxis often mistake the hotel for the YWCA nearby.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Out of the way and likely to stay that way,
"Loved the hotel. Don't understand why it isn't promoted more. Fabulous location, charming rooms, 2 swimming pools.Very popular Italian restaurant. Downside: lack of attention to small details (eg gym was not open early in am, pool loungers needed a good clean). Wonder why more isn't made of hotel's history (located in former army building on Fort Canning,Singapore's  oldest archaeological site).",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A delight but in need of a little more attention to detail,

Would definitely stay here again in future.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful hotel with great service,
"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Fort Canning in a Premium King room in June, it was a wonderful experience overall. With the working station and the restroom overlooking the park, it is just something you can't find it in Singapore! The only - point is the air conditioning, it is a bit too noisy, spoken to staffs at front desk and realised that it was due to technical problems.   The breakfast provided at the Glasshouse was average compared to other hotels in Singapore, however, the ambience was good and the place is indeed perfect for relaxation.   Staffs in HFC are friendly, responsive to our requests and they are always willing to help when you need them.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great weekend getaway for 2,
"Very happy I found Hotel Fort Canning. Having tried many large business and small hotels in Singapore this is definitively my favorite boutique place to stay and no need to look any further. It's a quiet and charming oasis on a perfect location with only a 15 min. walk to Paragon or Clarke Quay. The heritage building is of old elegance with contemporary, tasteful design of lobby and restaurants and high tech rooms with all thinkable needs available. The pools and fitness center are perfect for relaxation, so are the complementary cocktail hours every late afternoon. The staff is outstanding, friendly and helpful. An excellent and luxury stay, already looking forward to my next visit. Strongly recommend.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Wonderful and elegant,

HFC is completely relaxing, bringing you away from the noisy Singapore full of people, tall buildings and heavy traffic. if you are a local, come here for a nice staycation that is also value for money. If you are a tourist, trust me...

I will be updating further.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful Tranquil Oasis,
"Cool and calm and in walking distance of the marina, Chinatown and Colonial district.  Lovely to be in the park, but also so close to everything. Nicely equipped, but a bit perplexed by the electronics! They serve guests free evening wine and nibbles in the residents lounge. Breakfast is served in the Glasshouse and is excellent.   The bar in the main part of the hotel is not owned by the hotel and can't charge to room, which was a bit strange.  Only other grumble is that the air con was very noisy - hence ave sleep quality! Would recommend to all those who dislike big corporate/conference hotels, which seemed to be the main other choice for this quality of hotel in Singapore. I would stay there again without a 2nd thought.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,A haven in the City,
I thought this hotel was just fantastic! It had a really interesting layout and felt exceptionally luxurious. The only criticism I had was our room had a very disappointing suite area with a not so comfortable couch and it just wasn't a practical use of space. The bedroom made up for this as it was absolutely beautiful. We ate in the restaurant there and it was also beautiful. Great experience!,5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Loved It!,
"This place charms before you even see it.  As your taxi turns up into Fort Canning Park, you know you are in for a treat.  Overlooking the city, it is removed from it, yet walking instance downhill to many major attractions.  The rooms are futuristic and it's 2 restaurants and  two pools are unique as well.  Yet the price is well below some ofthe over rated stars of Singapore.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Convenient to everything I want to do in Singapore yet away from the hustle and bustle.,

Hotel Fort Canning is gorgeous. I only have the most basic room, and it is huge, quiet, has a separate lovely bathroom with deep bath and a gorgeous outlook. I find out when I check in that breakfast is included (amazing breakfast with all food so hot and fresh), free drinks Inc French champagne from 6 pm til 8pm, and free WIFI.

"In the past I had stayed at the Pan Pacific which was huge but a little soulless. The architectural conversion was sensitively done, and the rooms are comfortable and well appointed (though why no shaving mirror or spare toilet paper?). The buffet breakfast has significant choice. We loved the location and discovered you can be at Dhoby Ghaut underground in 10 minutes or take the walking trail to Clarke Quay - the paths are well lit at night.  The complimentary espresso was a nice touch - and given drink prices in Singapore, the champagne in the early evening was delightful.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Peaceful haven in a tranquil park,
"Hotel Fort Canning was a wonderful place to say in Singapore. The room was lovely and had a view of the city. The hotel grounds are immaculate and the parkland surrounds are lush and tranquil, yet only a 15 minute walk to Orchard Road, Clarke Quay and Chinatown, as well as close to the MTR.

Stayed at Fort Canning for business.  I was upgraded to a suite which may have made my experience of the hotel even better than it would have been but this is a fantastic hidden gem in Singapore.  So hidden that most taxi driver cannot find it.  It opened just about a year ago. The rooms are very modern and functional (although not unusual in Singapore) with views of the park that surrounds the hotel.  The staff was really efficient whenever I asked for something.

It is very central but being in the middle of the park and  a very historicalal part of the city  you feel away from the hustle and bustle but can be anywhere in 10 Mins.

The breakfast was more than adequate and value wise was way better than the S$42 breakfast at Fairmont Singapore.

After 1.5 hours finally get a room that is smart enough to turn out lights. This property could have been so much more.

"We went to JW for our honeymoon, and we were surprised with their hospitality, especially the attendant Sarah. They even gave us a welcome cake. The room is nice and clean, and we specifically loved the bath tub so much!  They gave us water bottles when they noticed we ran out of them, and left us with lens cleaner when they saw i was wearing eyeglasses without me asking! Thoughtful and A++++ service!  Hoping to be back someday. Thank you JW Mariott! Your service is highly commendable.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Room and Service,

Ann",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent customer service,
Our stay at the hotel was made immensely better at the executive lounge. Hazel served us during the happy hour and throughout the visits to the lounge and her bubbly nature made the visits there more fun.  Drinks on offer were great and we spent the evenings here in the lounge.  The breakfast variety served at the Beach Road Kitchen was vast. Quality was good.   The reason why this review did not get 5stars was the pathetic room size. It was supposed to be Premium room but you cannot tell by the size. I have stayed in many Marriott hotels and I must say this is one of the most disappointing. It is a pity that the room was a great let down to an otherwise marvellous stay.,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent service at Executive Lounge and Great Breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen. Pity the room was a letdown.,
"This was my second staycay at this hotel. The rooms was clean and the rest room perfect. I booked a room with executive lounge access and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quality of food was good and the servings were generous. The most impressive part was the variety of drinks available. Riesling, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc , Bordeaux, Pinot noir, and all kinds of whiskies. Drink to you hearts content. Service was excellent especially from Hazel. She remembered us since our staycay last year. Congratulations to JW Marriott for the great facility, high standard of service and awesome staff. It was definitely worth the stay here.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"JW Marriott South Beach, Singapore",

A big thank you to Hazel, John and Kay and everyone else on shift on 20 Aug Sat! We truly had an enjoyable time at the lounge and it was simply the highlight of the entire staycation. We wanted more nachos despite kitchen closed but hazel and team just made it happen. It's definitely one of the best executive lounges in Singapore! And the team definitely deserves a big thank you and a pat on the back!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,6* Team JW Executive Lounge,
My stay at this lovely and modern hotel was amazing after 2 years i haven't return to Jw Marriot Sg!. Check in-Smooth and the staff at reception provided outstanding service! Room-Superb! Breakfast-Top notch Poolside-Amazing with nice pool attendants The only feedback that i have is this hotel suppose to have Gym instructor like Marina Bay Sands and Pan Pac hotel. Last time before covid i know that there is 1 gym Supervisor at Jw. Probably the gym should add more strength machines like Cybex Hack Squat and Prone leg curl.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,One of the best hotel in Singapore,

The facilities were updated and clean, with the interior design being my favorite out of all the past Mariotts I have visited. I want to specifically express my gratitude toward Hazel, Gab, Kay, and Chef Jerome in the Executive Lounge. My party came in late and they were more than accommodating to meet the needs of tired and hungry travelers. This lounge had one of the best foods served during afternoon tea with exceptional service each and every time we dined there. Hazel was very warm and welcoming and definitely made our stay worth it. If you are traveling to Singapore I would highly recommend staying at this hotel,",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,JW is worth it!,
"Great Hotel in Singapore. Especially the amenities, rooms and breakfast. However, the pool facilities are in other 5 star hotels in Singapore much better.

You made my stay wonderful.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great City Hotel,
"I held my wedding dinner at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, and the ballroom was a dream to say the least. It was a joy working with the event coordinator Chanel, who was extremely responsive on email, as well as the banquet manager Thanaraj who was a delight on our actual day. Small things like the AV were also all provided for which gave the wedding couple less to worry about.  Bridal suite was excellent, and the service rendered by the hotel was outstanding from the start till the end.

"This is a great property but on first glance seems more business vs family appropriate. The lobby is modern and sleek but dark. The rooms are are also modern but small. If you are traveling with kids I recommend booking two adjoining rooms, which is what we did. However, the staff was excellent. The restaurant is wonderful with a vast selection that everyone will enjoy. Finally the location is awesome, close to many key attractions.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel in the business district,
functional business hotel - not sure I would say it is 5* shower strength weak room cleanliness/quality good  still can't work out why there isn't a proper coffee machine (nespresso etc) in the room - very disappointing,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great business hotel - not for leisure,
"We stayed for 7 nights and we enjoyed our stay. As platinum members, we were able to access breakfast at the Beach Road Kitchen and the lounge.  We were blown away by the service and attention you get from Hazel, Antonio, Gab and the whole lounge crew. They are the hardest working team I've seen for accommodating (getting your drinks, removing empty plates so quickly, introducing food) especially with so much people during the afternoon tea and evening services. They didn't skip a beat! Really good food selection for a lounge. We couldn't be any happier and will definitely be back!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic hotel and service,

Centrally located meant that our guests had no issues getting to the venue and many were impressed by the dinner menu. Dickson our sales assistant was very helpful and addressed many of our concerns promptly. I am personally very grateful for his help throughout our event.  Needless to mention, the ballroom equipped with dazzling lights and full panel LED screen left a deep impression among the hosts and the guests. It was a magical night and all the staff were extremely helpful in their services. Thank you JW Marriot for making our special day so memorable.

"Not my expectation of JW Marriott, and being a status member.   1. Checked in at 1530 hrs, despite indicating early check in at 1100 hrs.   2. Soft skills of check in staff need to be improved, being super direct in the area of conversations and not understanding customer's needs.  3. Dirty room upon checked in, dirty towels provided.  Need major improvement in the area of softskills and house-keeping.",2.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Service and Room can be better,
"This is an overdue review.  Wanted to give a special shout out to the staff at the Executive  Lounge, especially Yi Xuan, Lorraine, Irene, Cora and Hazel. They took very good care of us, ensuring we had enough to eat and drink.  On our first day at the hotel, Hazel was very welcoming and made us feel at home.  She went the extra mile to make drinks that I could consume.  Not to leave out the other staff at the hotel, the front desk staff have been warm and welcoming, yet professional. Service has been excellent, responses were prompt when I had questions both in person and thru the app.  The maintenance crew were prompt coming to fix the little problem with the shower door handle.  The little souvenir they left was a nice touch.   Looking forward to my upcoming staycation.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hospitality,
Stayed 2 nights with a friend in this hotel. A friend of mine brought me in to the club lounge and I have a chance to meet Hazel and Lorraine here whom best represent the lounge.

After settling in the room, a bottle of Porsecco was sent to the room, appreciate the service recovery from Wizalina. Good effort to go beyond to make our stay a memorable one.

The food at both Madame Fan and Akira Back were both outstanding, we will be revisiting them again.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Professional service from staff, questionable room and lounge decor",
"First time in Singapore after Covid: this hotel is still superb as I remember it. Location is just over 3 MRT stops; walking distance (at least walking for me) to CBD, Singapore river, and to Fort Canning. But the service is simply perfect: starting from the housekeeping that were leaving small messages every day, to the business lounge (the buffet has been changed into a kind of afternoon tea, which is very rich) to everyone in the hotel. I will never think of another location when I will be in Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Back again after Covid, Excellent in everything!",
"Had a wonderful stay at JW Marriott! Warm and friendly service from the front desk team and thank you for taking care of all our special requests.

Flow18 pool has great views overlooking the Marina Bay district. Had an enjoyable dinner with our 3-course meal at The Akira Back and a hearty breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen too. Location is convenient, of walking distance to Suntec City.  Looking forward to another staycation at JW Marriott again soon!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect staycation at JW Marriott,
First time to this hotel. Just wanted to express my thanks to a fantastic warm reception by Alex. I wanted to upgrade but there were no club lounge.

I was totally impressed and decided to change to higher end room even without seeing the better room.  I cannot wait to see how the room.and club lounge is like. Alex made my day. Last whole week been calling in but so difficult to get one he managed to do magic. Great Job and service Alex. Thanks,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Service by Front Desk,
"I've stayed at hotels all over, including here in Singapore.  I also want to acknowledge the pandemic is still a thing and people are trying their best.  This hotel was perfectly adequate, but felt closer to a Renaissance than a true JW Marriott, what is supposed to be their flagship brand.  All requests were met with delays and hesitation.  The Executive lounge booked up a week in advance.  The pool was cold and had little seating.  Breakfast was a zoo - hard to get drinks.  I ended up checking out a day early.  I was tired of not feeling welcome.  Save your money and go elsewhere",2.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Moderate and Meh - Marriott can do better,

The amenities were perfect and the bed very comfortable.

"My wife and I stayed at JW for our honeymoon and we were shocked at how tiny the hotel room was for the crazy price we paid for the room. For $550, we were expecting a generous sized room with a room in good condition but not only was the wallpaper peeling badly in our room, there were stains all over our wardrobe. We tried sending feedback about our bad stay via email and NOBODY even bothered responding to us. Yeah sure the pool is nice with a nice view but majority of the rooms do not face Marina Bay and on the advertised photos, the photos falsely advertised a Marina Bay View outside. Overall a bad stay at a ""5 star"" hotel with absolutely terrible recovery service by the hotel.",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"DISAPPOINTING stay at a hotel we expected so much from. ""5 stars""??

"Stayed in the family room. It was big enough to accommodate the 4 of us. Check in was a breeze. Staff were friendly. Parking was also free, which was good. The king-sized bed was very comfortable. Slept very well. Bathroom was big and spacious.  Downside: the pool was small and very cold. The view was nice though. Also, the hotel staff never gave us a proper introduction to the hotel. We only found out about the pool table and fusball table on our last day. Would have been good for the kids if we found out earlier.

We booked the club room and had access to the Club Lounge at the JW Marriott.  Room was big enough for three and had an awesome view of the sea.   However, may need some upgrading works in the room, eg. Painting    Package came with breakfast and tea in the afternoon.  Food was delicious.

The rooms were comfortable and clean, I had enough space to move around and do simple exercises to keep active. The huge windows were a plus too. The food was good and nutritious though they changed the menu halfway and since some of the food repeated, I opted to have delivery once. Delivery was also easy. I'd also like to thank all the staff, from check-in, to courtesy calls and especially the Dining Team, Cora, Melvin, Kay and Rose who made the stay a lot better with their hospitality.

"I spent 10 days in isolation here during Covid. Quality of the furnishings and fixtures is high and the room (1526) was of adequate size.  My room had large windows but was on the wrong side to have any interesting views. There is a lot of greenery which is sometimes more calming compared to a normal city view. Under quarantine there is no opportunity to use the hotel facilities and I didn't pay extra to get proper meals. Under normal circumstances, this location is within walking distance to city hall mrt and the attached mall.   Being in isolation is not ideal, however it helps to be in a decent hotel room like this.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Quarantine Hotel,

The swab station on the rooftop was super convenient. Management put a lot of thought and effort into planning and maintenance, and most of the staff who I encountered were genuine. Pleasant stay, good days.  A surprising problem, my pillow smelt like puke or some weird smell. Not sure what happened there but chucked it in the cupboard.  Another smaller one - getting the wrong food delivered twice  If I could make a recommendation, better movie channels. That is all, thank you for the service and hospitality. Honoured to stay :) Good day.  Best Regards, H",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,We all know it’s good (SHN stay),

"Absolutely amazing experience with JW Marriott during my 14 day quarantine.  Everyone were polite, friendly and eager to help.  What I loved was Marriott balancing their ""human"" side, calling me halfway through to check out on my wellbeing, and also the ""technology"" side, giving me access to whatsapp and acting on my requests through the app very quickly.  Particular shout out to Brian who had to don all his PPE to my room to fix the short circuit in the room due to an overflowing kettle, and still provided me with a little gift after he is done too!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,14 day quarantine,

I changed several but all of them were lack of natural light. Not a problem for a great sleep but complicates awakening.

Hard to really comment about the quality of this hotel since I was there for SHN.  The staff was very pleasant for the limited interactions I had with them.  The food quality of the free meals was not that great.  There should be an option to opt out of the meal program at the hotel and pay less for your stay.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,SHN Stay,
"We were allocated to the hotel for our 3 weeks SHN. I have to say that the team at hotel did a really great job to ensure our safety, comfort and welfare are well taken care of during these trying times. I must emphasize that the meals at the hotel has been really great! So far, they have ensured that our meals (lunch and dinner) are different for all 21 days and they tasted really great! Breakfast was on a repeat mode weekly, with 2 of them being repeated within a week.

"Booked a staycation for my girlfriend's birthday. Got a free upgrade to a family room which we appreciated very much. But what topped the entire experience was the lovely crew ( Hazel, Melvin, Yusof, Kay and Trine) from the executive lounge.   The team noticed it was a birthday celebration and greeted the birthday girl. They were quick to check if every diner in the lounge were comfortable and whether there was anything else they could serve/assist with.   All in all, it was a lovely night stay and we wished we stayed longer.   Highly recommended!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Impeccable service!,

"The check in process was relatively smooth, and the check in agent even gave us a late check out. The decor in the public areas is design inspired and pleasant enough, but not outstanding. The room - which was supposed to be an upgrade from the deluxe room - was disappointing. The layout was odd, not comfortable, with a (too) large bathro and corridor but limited sleeping area. The fittings looked worn too, surprising for a relatively new hotel. The remote was non responsive and the buttons sticky. Overall, rather disappointing and I would not recommend a staycation here.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Disappointing experience,

Lots of people say that the breakfast option is limited but I thought it was plentiful.

"Return stay Amazing property  Special thanks to executive lounge staff Jacqueline, Melvin and Noel who made our stay comfortable and hospitable. Likewise, Luna from front desk was equally attentive and helpful.  At present in this Covid climate, this is the only Marriott hotel offering close to full lounge service where it opens at 12pm and close at 9pm for your hightea, evening cocktail and tea/coffee fix.  Property starting to show some wear and tear across which is understandable.  Food at Akira back and Madame Fan was great! Breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen needs significant improvement compared to its sister properties (St Regis or Westin). During my stay, the main course could only be served once unlike other properties.  Looking forward to return!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Splendid,

The pool view was awesome in the night. Overall, i had a lleasant stay. Only had problems during check out. Waited for almost 20 minutes to get clearance. My grab car waiting. Apparently the Front Desk cashier did not post in my $100 incidental deposit and no receipt was issued to me upon check in. So they need to verify before issuing the paid out back.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fabulous Stay,
"Hotel room was clean and comfortable, however, there were some things malfunctioning. The automated curtains and blinds were not working, fortunately the curtains were closed as the room I was on was facing a little garden (only accessible by staff at the moment). The deluxe room came with a bath tub which is one of the differences compared to the studio room.   Hotel staff were friendly and accommodated to our request to stay in the main building. Location is good too! Just a stone throw away from Esplanade MRT and Suntec City just opposite. Carpark is also provided by the hotel.  The view from the swimming pool is fantastic! Absolutely love it! ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Deluxe Room & Hotel Review,

I had great time spending a special day at JW Marriott. I love the service of staff Joey who is very alert and assist guests with all smile. Front desk Bella who is very helpful.  The pool was indeed the best part of the hotel which offers a spectacular view I almost had no photo to take home with me however Rosalyn the pool receptionist was very helpful in assisting guests to take photo.

The weekend staycation was made fabulous by the impeccable service at the Lounge, the team (Melvin, Jacquelyn, Yusoff and Bella) customer service was of top notch and all of them have great friendly vibes which made the lounge experience tremendous!  I would like to also compliment Chef Jerome for his hospitality and engaging small conversations with us on the food. All chefs know how to prepare food but not all chefs know how to engage guests, it is important for chefs to engage the guest on the food for feedback and improvisations. He is a great and valuable asset.  Thank you and Stay safe.  Mr Lee",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Impeccable service!,
"The hotel itself is quite small and slightly lacklustre, with a funky modern concept to it. Check in was fine, the view from the room was beautiful (overlooking the CBD, Marina Bay etc), and the indoor pool provided a nice view of the city! There are many food outlets at the foot of the hotel, and Raffles City, Suntec City are all within walking distance which is nice.  Hazel, Yusuff and Kevin from the executive lounge provided amazing service even though it was crowded, especially in catering for my dietary needs (Vegan). Mohammed Ali from Beach Road Kitchen was also helpful during the morning breakfast! Overall pleasant stay.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Helpful staff!,
"Hotel is immaculate and the check in process well organised though I was disappointed that there is no counter for Marriott Bonvoy member guests so we had to queue up with social distancing of course.   I did however get my free upgrade so I was very pleased with that and room is spacious with lovely bathtub.m and street view.  The area is very fun with lots of bars, restaurants and a 7 Eleven at the MRT all within 5 mins walk.  Pool time is disappointing as you only get a 45 minute slot but there is a choice of two pools. 45 minutes is really only enough time to get settled, take a dip, dry off and pack up to leave.  Overall lovely property and would stay again.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,City break ,

Our subsequent visits were also well looked after by her, she made sure we were comfortable and have enough food and drinks.  Recognition should be given to the lounge staff, Emmanuel.

All the staff from check in to executive lounge to pool attendants, to chamber maids to breakfast resturants and in room service meals delivery are tip top. You can see clearly that the hotel is a bit short of staff during covid when the foreigner staff are not allowed in, they really worked together. I see the check in staff also appearing in breakfast resturant helping out and the hotel manager was seen everywhere that I went doing the actual work. The hotel is also in excellent location and right above a MRT and the rooms are beautiful and totally sound proof.

Thank you for making us feel welcome and not treat us differently just because we stood a little chance of being infected by covid-19. And a huge thank you to Verna from housekeeping!

Thank you so much for the hospitality.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great stay, 5 stars.",
Great service from hotel staff. Food was catered by the Singapore govt and became rather repetitive the worst being the breakfast.  The only issue I would bring up is that I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the finishings of the room. For example the quality of the floor tiles and the sinks were not quite what I expected of a JW Marriott.  There were also bits of dried instant noodle hidden under crevices on the floor which the cleaning staff missed from the previous occupant. But the customer service was top notch- well done,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Quarantined for 14 days,
"Stayed for a night before Singapore enforced circuit breaker measures. The hotel was already well prepared with all the temperature checks etc. Check-in was smooth, balloons and cake, personalised note was made placed in the room after coming back from dinner.   My only main gripe was the framed art in the room, it's a bit scary to sleep facing it at night. Breakfast buffet spread the next morning seemed rather limited, not sure if that's the usual spread. The staff came over with a birthday cake again and sang a birthday song - only to my horror that the addressed me - 'Mandy/Wendy' and weren't sure of my name, likewise on the birthday card. Did not expect those blunders from a 5-star establishment.  Nonetheless, it was an overall pleasant stay.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Birthday Staycation in March 2020,

Azizah and Shah at the reception were also extremely knowledgeable and professional, best I've seen in any spa.   Glad that we were able to unwind safely despite the situation. Thanks to JW Marriott for keeping us safe and comfortable.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Birthday visit was sublime,
"Me and my girlfriend decided to have a staycation at JW Marriott for one night and we had access to the exec lounge. We were there from 2:30 onwards and did not leave the place until it closed. We were given a wonderful service by Melvin, Fussaf, and Chef Lionel, another the filipino head chef and all the other staff that were working there. They were all warm and welcoming. Thank you all for the wonderful experience.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent experience,
"We had a great massage at Spa by JW with our masseuse Carmen and Hatmah. Big spa and looks so luxurious. They have a steam room, sauna and jacuzzi as well which you can use complimentary if you have treatments with them. However their jacuzzi was not working at that point of time when we came. The receptionist Shaa apologised and allowed us to come back at any time to enjoy the spa facilities so no issues with that! Great service overall!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great spa!,
"I visited the Spa at JW Marriott for the third/fourth on 18th March and was treated to the best massage yet by Therapist Hatmah. Her pressure was perfect right from the start and it was relaxing throughout the session!  I also want to commend on your spa receptionist Shakinah (i hope i spelled her name right if not i'm sorry!) for her impeccable hospitality, professionalism and product knowledge. She is always so welcoming and warm! She takes time to ask me about work and gets to know me better, something i find that is lacking in the service industry these days. Shakinah's essential oil recommendations have always hit the spot so far. Kudos to the rest of the team too! ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Spa visit fantastic as ever,
"We had recently gone back to Singapore for several days and stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for the first time. Absolutely beautiful hotel, great accommodation and central location. All staff interactions were always very attentive and  friendly. We wanted for nothing and nothing was too much trouble. Excellent customer service was provided throughout the Hotel; from the Front Desk staff,  Concierge, Housekeeping and Restaurant staff. Our favourite place to relax after a day out and about in Singapore was the Tonic Bar where we met the very professional and  friendly Khosi. Her very broad knowledge on all things Gin is very interesting and amazing. We would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you JWM we will be back.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Stay and excellent customer service.,
"Had a delightful, relaxing time tonight at the Executive lounge. Special thanks to Lionel - we loved the food and enjoyed the special Singaporean treats you made. The  Old Fashion was also top notch. Best of luck in your chef career!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Executive Lounge - Thanks Lionel,
"I visited the executive lounge and was served by Lionel. He was attentive and made sure that we were comfortable. He was thoughtful throughout and made sure we were well taken care of. Towards the closing of the lounge, he even made sure we had enough drinks to go. Thank you for the memorable service, Lionel!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent service!,
"We got upgraded to a suite during check-in, celebrating a hens' night and staff helped to decorate the room.  The suite was huge and very spacious.   We requested for more bathroom slippers as there were 4 of us, but service staff came back and passed us a whole bag of toiletries enough for more than 4 pax, and we ended up bringing them home.   Thank you so much!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Got upgraded to a Suite!,
"I had the most pampering experience by my masseuse, Mandy. I had the 50-min Aching Legs massage and I managed to fall asleep despite the pain due to water retention in my calves. The room was spacious and did not make me feel claustrophobic and the heating mattress made the experience so much more comfortable. I will definitely come back again and make use of the facilities!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Most pampering spa experience!,
I think that it is the latest Marriott property in Singapore. And it fits up to the standard as I wish from a JW brand hotel. As the Marriott Tang Plaza is a bit outdated I would recommend this one as my new Marriott default hotel in Singapore. A bit stylish in design and has everything you need.   Location is in the Suntec area so close by to everything.   A bit of downside is the pool that seems to be a bit small. But I didn't have time for swimming anyway. But if you are for looking for relaxing in the pool I would recommend that you look for other hotels.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A JW as you would expect it,
"We had such a pleasant stay. The hotel superb location is situated right in the city center, with many nice malls, restaurants, and bars. As well as the walkable distance to many sights of Singapore(for tourists). The very modern chic rooms are the best! Very spacious, clean, comfortable and of course it's gorgeous view, especially at the pool too! XD We were served food in our room by Ramesh, I must mention, a very helpful and polite man, we were impressed by how he took the time to explain everything, made sure we got all that we need and most importantly to have the best experience here @ JW, a well-personalized service. =) Well done! Can't wait for another staycation here!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Luxuriously Chic,
"The JW on Beach Road was a fantastic stay, especially for a long business stay.   The service in the Lounge was fantastic, Chef John, Olive and the bar staff became almost friends in the couple weeks that I stayed at the JW.   They made a long business trip not only bearable, but fun.   They were always happy to talk, help with anything and suggest things to do over the weekend.  Such as a great hike in MacRitchie Resevoir park. Staff at the JW Marriott make it a reason to return again.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,12 days of great service and friendly smiles in Singapore,
"Very impressive experience right from getting down from the car with the welcoming reception by its lobby ambassador; Lisa.  Although my sleep were disturbed by loud shouting noise from the adjacent room in the middle of the night, the hotel staff were very apologetic on it upon my check out although it was not their fault. Vivien Lee at front desk even offered to waive my breakfast which was a nice gesture.  All in all, great staff.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent customer service and attention to details.,
"when possible i always try and stay in a marriott hotel i have found that usually they are in the best locations and always have a steady standard service. the JW was no different the staff were friendly room was great, location was EXCELLENT i found no faults to be honest.. i will certainly stay again",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Excellent stay, typical Marriott experience",
"Stayed one night to celebrate wedding anniversary. The staff Ms Jusanna, was very helpful during our check-in when we asked for a west facing room with good view. Although the hotel has allocated us a room, she made effort to search for a better room without showing any signs of frustration. She served with her heart, very genuine. Her supervisor ( Don't know her name) was guiding patiently and also helped to search.  Everything about the hotel is up to our expectations, we enjoyed our stay!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful Experience,
"Everything is great, the concierge Melody was very helpful and courteous, buffet breakfast was wonderful. The only thing to watch for is the check out stations are separated into 4 individual places and there were no organized lines at busy time, some of us tried to form a line but people kept cutting in front to individual cashiers, I had to wait for at least 20 minutes upon checkout because of the confusion.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Centrally located friendly hotel,
"This is quite a new hotel with a very modern feel. That said the thing that struck me most was the great service.  It seemed at every turn there was another smiling team member eager to provide assistance. The rooms are very nice, a good size and with comfortable beds. The floor on which the gyn, pool and bar are situated is a great place to hand out. The infinity pool which looks over the city is amazing and there are lots of places to just sit and relax and read a book, enjoy a drink or whatever. A convenient location with MRT stations close by plus Suntec for shopping across the road.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Service,
Beautiful hotel located not far from Marina Bay.  Check in was a little slow and disappointing however the hotel is beautiful and stay is first class.  Try and get marina sands view. Breakfast is above the rest and if it had a better view would be perfect.  True reflection of all that Singapore is.  Will definitely recommend this hotel.  Did I mention it is located next to two malls ,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Typical Singapore excellence ,
"The hotel is located within walking distance of almost everything (sometimes it's a long walk, but doable.) It is very well upkept, clean and modern!! The Executive lounge is top notch with wonderful caring employees -- our thanks to Hazel and Eva for your wonderful, friendly service!!!  Sara at the taxi desk is also a great asset to the hotel. He was very helpful in his suggestions and gave perfect directions and insights on things not to be missed. We will definitely return!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Had a wonderful time,
"We arrived on NYE direct from Australia at 6pm. We were very disappointed to learn our room was not yet ready. This is sub par management from an expensive and exclusive hotel. Management did, however, provide us with a temporary room and gave us access to the executive lounge which provides breakfast, snacks and evening cocktails. This was appreciated as compensation. As for the hotel its 5 star. Friendly staff. Big clean and modern rooms. Heated toilet seats with remote controlled bidet amazed my kids. The pool was great (though a little cool) and the location is unbeatable. ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great hotel and location, bad check in experience",
"Nice hotel but very small room, brakefast very good and the staff very efficient.  Very easy to go anywhere , metro station just by the stairs.  Very clean city but very expensive.  If you are a smoker please consider to pay attention where is the designated are because even you think is outside is forbidden. ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,X-mas,
"I just had a two night stay at this property.  Very centrallyl located. I enjoyed my stay.  My club room was just OK.  Somewhat lacking in personality.  Electricity outlets on either side of the bed didn't work which was problematic.  The desk chair does not roll so it is not easy to move on the carpet.   The bathroom was nice however.  The lounge offering variety was spectacular.  Spoiled for choice in the mornings and the evenings.  They do need to do some work on making sure the ""hot"" foods are actually hot.  Many of the supposed warm breakfast items (mushrooms, sausage, baked beans) were hardly even lukewarm.  They certainly need to be kept much hotter.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,OK Hotel.  Incredible Concierge Lounge,
"If you are looking for a tranquil and yet very close to bustling area this the best place for you. Don't forget to include the access in execute lounge to experience the most hospitable and friendly staff. Thanks to Hazel, Melvin, Vino, Sharmane and for the rest of the gang for ensuring your needs are well attended and to chef Peter and Jessie for the foods. ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Friendly People ,
"My first stay at this Marriott hotel in Singapore for 2 nights, but will not be my last! Great hotel for facilities and location. Staff were very attentive and tried to ensure our stay was very good. Stella in the executive lounge stands out, and should be recongnised in making me feel happy at all times. I am a Marriott ambassador level person, but Stella ensured that I was treated like a king. Would stay again at this hotel the next time I am in Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great Stay, Great staff and One of my favourite Marriott hotels",
"Staff could not have been more helpful.  We arrived early but were given a temporary room to shower etc for a previous engagement.  The rooms were beautiful, comfortable beds, great view of the marina. Pool delightful especially when it was raining.  Will certainly stay there again next time we will book the executive level.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Loved this Hotel,
"The hotel is strategically located near major shopping malls such as Suntec City, Raffles City and Marina Square.  Therefore finding places to shop and eat is not an issue at all.  The hotel staff are professional and friendly, and the check-in and checkout process is a breeze.  The facilities are new, with an outdoor pool and gym.  The views are amazing overlooking the marina bay skyline.  However the room feels small and the door needs a hard push to open and a tap with the card in order to close properly. ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,5 Star Hotel with excellent services and location,
We stayed 5 nights with my family  in JW and I can not say enough good words about staff and service.  They went above and beyond to make our stay so comfortable and memorable.  I can thank enough Melvin to make the entire family feel  so special.  The entire staff and manager Jacky was very professional and worm at the same time.  5 star  hospitality.  ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best service ever. ,
"The staff at the executive lounge made our visit memorable at the hotel.  Melvin, what an amazing person. Thank you.  We will recommend this hotel not just it's a great property, Hazel, Rose and the rest of the staff. Just great.  ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Just amazing. ,
Well located hotel across the street from the raffles. Decor very Avant garde or almost psychedelic. That may not suit everybody. Ultra modern but no local charm. Rooms on the small side. Friendly efficient staff. Good if on business or short layover in town. Lacks the local charm or atmosfer of Singapore,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Avand garde,
I was there for a staycation. And I love the service from the staff. The attention to details were great. Kudos to the lobby staff. I would like to mention Elaine who helped us with our check in and directed us to spa place as we were closing on our time. Another to highlight was the spa crew that were working on the 20th Dec. They returned my lost watch to me. In all I had a great experience. I would head back to JW Marriott again,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,I was impress,
"We received a very warm welcome from the doorman and the receptionist. Estelle from call center was also very helpful and willing to assist with enquiries. The room was very clean and the housekeeper, Robin who cleaned our room also left a note in our room and left us with lens cleanser as we maintain the room cleanliness. Thank you for the service provided, it was a very enjoyable stay!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Enjoyable stay,
"Traveling and stayed at the hotel for a night. We were welcomed very nice with a good room. Got a room upgrade due to my status with bonvoy. Visited the club lounge for some drinks, it was a great atmosphere there. The entire staff was very friendly, helpful and celebrates hospitality at it's best. Rolemodel is Melvin the supervisor. He does a great job. He leads his team with passion. He is not only managing the lounge very well, he helps his team with a hands on philosophy. It was just great. The front office granted me late check out prior my night flight which was another benefit. The location and the top floor pool is great with a superb view. Overall, I will be back and look forward to such hosts.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Nice stay, great staff at the club lounge",
"We really enjoyed this hotel. Luxury, cleanliness (rooms cleaned twice a day!), style, friendly staff- all of this and more. Great location. One of the reasons to pick this hotel was because they offered New Year's Eve Countdown Party on the 18th Floor. Great food, good selection of beverages, perfect music to everybody's taste and unbelievable spirit. We enjoyed every minute of it! Also, best views of the city and over two hours non stop amazing fireworks! Highly recommended- hotel and the party!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect Stay,

"I love this hotel so much.  Great Location, Guest service, foods, atmosphere , Staff, pools..... I have enjoyed every moments of my stay.  Especially all staff are so helpful and knowledgeable. Room is gorgeous and well maintained.  Highlight are 2 pools both overlooking beautiful skylines of Singapore make you so relaxed and calm.  Very well maintained and very clean.  Last but not at the least I want to mention 2 ladies ""Hazel"" at Executive lounge and ""Sarah"" (Loyalty & Guest relations executive). They are so professional and friendly made my stay happier and comfortable.  Many thanks to them and all other staff. Of course room rate is in higher range but it worth for what you paid.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Oasis in bustle city,
"I recently stayed at JW Marriott in October while our visit to Singapore. The rooms are beautifully crafted with state of art technologies. Our room was upgraded by Marriott with a view to die for. Special recommendations for Hotel chef Arjun who was not only great at what he does but also took great care of us after knowing that we were vegetarian, he specially made vegetarian platter (Dal, Choley, Mixed veg and pranthas) for us and it was simply amazing. Do visit Marriott for dinner even if you are not staying here for any reason ...",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing hotel at awesome location with great staff 👍,

"We are not stayed at JW Marriot but only visit to experience breakfast on week end, I would say a fantastic experience, foods are fresh and cater a wide selection on foods and live cooking, service from arrival, dining and few time staff check to table which they do it in ellegant way, its awesome Breakfast :)",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Awesome Breakfast,
"I went to a conference in Singapore from September 14 - 17.  Service at the JW Marriott South Beach Singapore was the best.  The hotel was wonderful though the weather due to the smoke from Indonesia was not so good.  Lucky for us the hotel was just across the road from the Suntec Convention where the conference was held.  When I was not in meetings I spent time in the executive club at the JW.  Hazel provided such excellent service to my wife and I.  She was so cordial and caring to all our needs.  Brandon and Melvin also provided the best hospitality.  We hope to be back to the property soon.  We have traveled to many locations but we have to say  that nothing can beat the service we received from Hazel, Brandon and Melvin during our stay in September.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent service,
"""Designer"" hotel, where rooms are definitely small: very hard to even place a chair in front of the desk if you want to work, and other mistakes (i.e. the toilet door requires you literarily to squeeze to fit in the space). Lots of added details that could be removed for a more efficient space. Lifts with a dark-color changing light could be much more standard, and you could see the floor to press Staff is very helpful, and location excellent.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Designers should stay in the hotels they create,
"Just returned from a trip to Singapore.  First time at the JW Marriott.  A very uniquely designed hotel with interiors by Philippe Starck we were told.  The rooms were comfortable but not a big as you would normally expect in Asia - mirrors everywhere and not a finger print at all.  The rooms was extremely quite despite the downtown location.  Superb views at night from the 18th floor plunge pool.  Spa was also very pleasant.  The executive lounge is excellent value for money with great food and a 4 hour ""happy hour"" with all the drinks included.  We were well looked after by all the staff Hazel in the executive lounge was particularly helpful - many thanks for keeping us topped up!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Handy down town location,
"JW Marriott was a nice welcome upon arriving in Singapore. I currently do not have a permanent office and have therefore been using the executive lounge for work quite extensively. The lounge is well equipped and always stocked with snacks and drinks throughout the day. There is also a Quiet Zone, which is ideal for work. I would like to commend Hazel (in the executive lounge) for making sure that I am well looked after. My cup/glass never ran empty and she'd always make sure that I take some food from their selection, so that I never go hungry. Service was perfect. I'll make sure tollways stay at the JW Marriott whenever the opportunity arises. Thank you!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Big rooms, great service",
Had a short stay at this hotel on a stopover in Singapore. I reserved a Club Room was found that the room was surprisingly small in size but those working in the Club Lounge makes up for that. The food and drinks was good mix.   I would like to personally highlight Ms Noel from the Club Lounge who had provided me her personal recommendations on what to do and see for my short stopover since it was my first time here as well.  Will be back here if I ever get to stopover in Singapore again. Cheers!,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Club Lounge makes up for small sized room,
All great..food fabulous..staff can not be faulted Was not upgraded and that's understandable but the regular rooms are very very small..will probably go back to Westin. Pools have great view but awkward to use Lounge is stellar,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Room Tiny,
"A boutique JW Marriott like no other. A totally different look & feel from the usual JWMs of the world but with the same bespoke service one would expect from a JW Marriott hotel. The team on-site here are very well trained and passionate at their jobs. Hotel is located in a very ideal spot, just a mere stroll from Suntec and a stone's throw to Marina Bay Sands too. The meeting facilities here are exceptional and there's an amazing mix of colonial era settings with modern luxe where the meeting rooms sit as it's literally renovated army barracks and a clubhouse that make up the new hotel facilities. Great views during the F1 races too await you at the 18th floor. A truly comfortable stay is guaranteed here!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best JW Marriott Hotel I've stayed in!,
"We were  visiting family in Singapore and stayed for 5 nights in the hotel. The staff were brilliant from the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and there was always someone available to assist. The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout. Both of the hotels swimming pools are great and were quiet throughout our stay. I particularly suggest going to see the view at night from the 18th floor. We had access to the executive lounge so ate breakfast and dinner there most days. The food available was tasty and there was a varied selection. The hotel itself is in a great location and has everything you can ever need. Would not hesistate to recommend this hotel.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Highly recommended ,
"We recently spent 3 nights in Singapore at the Marriott South Beach. We were very impressed by the front desk and concierge staff. They were very welcoming, courteous, and responsive. We had a lovely room on the 23rd floor with a great view of the bay and CBD. The bedroom area was a bit small but the bathroom was really spacious. This was not an issue for us because we were always out and about exploring fascinating Singapore. The breakfast and dinner buffets were quite exceptional with a great variety of options for Western and Asian dining. The seafood offerings at the dinner buffet were well worth the price. We found it very easy to use cabs and/or the metro from the hotel. Raffles City Mall is directly across from the hotel.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great Location, Excellent Service",
"Stayed here for 2 nights for business trips. All I can say is the location is superb! Nearby 3 MRT stations within walking distance. Singapore most popular conference building is right acccross the street. Malls were practically next door.   The staff were very friendly and helpful. Best staff of all mariott brands. They gave special notes in my room and a complimentary wine bottle. Executive lounge facility was the best.   The only reason why I didnt give full rating was because the room was not satisfying. I was upgraded to larger room due to my platinum status. But, the room was very standard. It feels like a regular 4 star hotels. I hope they can fix this.

Rooms are nice, view is nice, two pools that can be used for great recreation. The breakfast didn't miss anything! If you're travelling to Singapore for leisure it's good to know that all the Hop on Hop off buses start and finish their lines right on the other side of the road. Also the entrance to Suntec City mall is right across the road. Just perfect!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel,
Pamper yourself with a cozy room in the right size (the toilet heats itself..). The gym is nice. Not that big but you have everything you need.

"Just a short two night stay and it was all good. The hotel is beautifully designed, elegant, brimming with art. The room is nice, has everything the guest would need. The bathroom is perfect.  One thing I would change about the room are the ceiling to floor thin metal blinds which cannot be raised to get an unobstructed view. The breakfast buffet is good, the staff very attentive.

Enjoyed our stay at the JW.  Very nice hotel- we were upgraded to a suite which was lovely.  Friendly staff- except for one of the concierge who acted as though we were bothering her when asking about bus passes- giving minimal info and generally not helpful- odd for a concierge.  The housekeepers were great- no waiting for your room to be cleaned- it was done by the time got back from breakfast!  The executive lounge staff was great- particularly Hazel and the lady at the soup and omelette station in the morning (I regret I can't remember her name).  They have 2 pools- we only used the infinity pool on the 18th floor which had great view of the city. Enjoyed our stay,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,great hotel and location,

"It was a good decision to select JW Marriott South Beach for a few days of family vacation in Singapore. Location is great, just across the street from the recently renovated Raffles Hotel and close to Suntec. This is a design hotel with a modern vibe, a lot of art and interesting highlights. Very professional staff, spacious room, comfortable beds and good amenities. We liked the integration of traditional heritage buildings into the complex. Executive lodge was excellent, very capable and nice staff and a special mention for Hazel who makes customers feel very welcome. The 2 pools look great but could be a bit warmer and we also missed some sun loungers for more relaxing hours by the pool.

"JW South Beach is an unique and extensive art museum kind enough to put hotels rooms inside so you can enjoy it! Five star service, beautifully appointed rooms, and an amazing location right above Esplanade MRT. They even have their own Botero sculpture, one of my favorite artists, for the icing on the cake. ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Beautiful Unique Hotel Living up to the JW Brand!,
"I would like to thank Stella at the Executive Lounge for her warmth and welcoming hospitality!  As i was working in the business center, she would ensure that i had everything that I needed on my work desk and that i was comfortable. She then took the initiative to serve me tea! I travel extensively and have stayed in many five star hotels around the world and i have not met any staff with the same sincerity and kindness.  Thank You, Stella!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"""Amazed by your 'service from the Heart' Stella, from the executive lounge""",
"Hotel is beautiful.  Rooms are not large but they are comfortable.  Hotel offers great amenities.  Infinity pool is beautiful, we took a bottle of wine up there and enjoyed a relaxing night and a wonderful view. Staff are pleasant and very helpful.  Convenient access to the efficient SMRT (mass transit), very easy to understand and get around.  Walking distance to Merlion (15-20 mins), Marina Bay (30-35 mins).

"No matter how great a brand is, service failures is part of any business. I think what seperates the professionals from amatures is their ability to turn the situtation around and use the shortcomings as a way to create a stronger relationship with the customer. I like to thank, Mr. Stephan the F&B GM and Ms. Eva from guest relations, Ann Margaret and all the team members at the exec lounge and beach rd. Cafe for quickly resloving my initial issue and go beyond their professional duties to create a long lasting impression.  Also, my wife is thankful for all the arrangements regatding her special diet.  We will return shortly.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great turn-around to resolve issues,
"My second visit to the JW Marriot Singapore.   My last stay was in January 2019 for just 2 days. Yet Jacquelyn, Hazel & Jollie recognised me and provided an excellent service of personal care.... during my staycation to view the National Day celebration dress rehearsals.   Special thanks to the Executive Lounge Team.  Despite my Bonvoy Plat Elite status; they were not able to upgrade me; as the hotel was packed for the ND parade. Hopefully next time.

"Excellent location to everything. The food in the exec lounge and the restaurants was awesome! Better than that though was the staff. Farrah was consistently helping her colleagues no matter what they needed. Melvin has a vibrant and outstanding personality that is fun, delightful, and contagious! Thanesh was great as well!  Thank you for an awesome visit at the end of May/beginning of June! We will definitely be back to visit again at some point in the future!   Of note, this hotel has an outstanding infinity pool, gym, and lounge area on the 18th floor in an open air set up. A must see!!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Loved this JW!,
"I travel a lot, and the courteousness of the staff here - particularly in the lounge - merits mention and praise. I have stayed here and most of the the other top hotels in Singapore, and the staff is near perfect, every single interaction. It is a combination of training, hiring, and just plain good all around people. I don't leave many 5 star reviews and I wish I could leave 6 for this staff. Kudos to the entire team.  I highly recommend staying here over any other property in Singapore, especially is you are Marriott Platinum.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best service in Singapore - bar none,
Beautiful hotel in a great location downtown close to all the tourist attractions- modern rooms- comfortable beds- really cool pools with a spa like vibe overlooking the city but they were cold and no place to lie in the sun. Nice club room and wonderful buffet breakfast.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Cool modern hotel,
"I celebrated my birthday with a buffet lunch,attended by 9 family members and 7 friends.  The buffet spread was plentiful with many local and western dishes, complete array of desserts. We were pretty impressed by the many cold items featured in their Cold Room.  Hot coffee n tea were also provided.  Unfortunately, my wife fell after returning from the toilet due to slippery floor after a downpour.  I had highlighted this danger of severe injury to patrons  to the management who had acknowledge this. They had undertaken to immediately remedy this danger so I hope that no other persons need to suffer the pain from fall and trauma of moving around during rainy days.  Undoubtedly the service plus the food surpasses many restaurants but protecting patrons from injury is paramount.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Danger lingers ,
"I wanted to cancel last minute and even though the hotel was completely full, they didn't show any flexibility, and they probably sold my room many times over. I even stayed in another Marriott property and still they showed no flexibility. I was not entitled to a late cancellation and still I would have expected this as a courtesy being an advance Bonvoy member. So be careful....",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Careful no flexibility on cancellation policy,
"Great location, beautiful rooms, great service, wonderful food and beverage offerings... all of that plus centrally located.  From the moment we arrived to the time we depart, the stay was absolutely wonderful. Attention staff is the key to this hotel WOW they were on their game.  AND if you have access to their Executive Lounge... do NOT miss the noodle bar in the morning......made to order.   We will go bac soon!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Always my choice in Singapore,
"We had our family vacation in JW Marriot SG last June when I celebrated my birthday. The accomodation was very good, the service of the Filipino staff was excellent and commendable. Our stay was very memorable and really much better than the other highly-rated hotel (which only allows 2 guests per room, in the swimming pool) where we stayed the day before. We really had fun & enjoyed the use of swimming pool area, after our day stroll. Kudos to the staff, we will book again here.  Ramil Ramos/ Philippines",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Very good accomodation,
"The hotel is ideally located next to two MRT stations (Esplanade & City Hall, three different lines!). Great hotel facilities (well equipped gym room and two lovely pools!).

"The hotel staff are really nice and the food was excellent.  We had dinner at the kitchen and drinks at the tonic bar.    The next morning we had breakfast at the executive lounge and the food was very very good for an executive lounge.  The rooms are a bit tired.  The white leather sofa was stained and the shower door was not working properly.  I highly recommend the hotel for its location, ambiance, views, food, and the friendly staff of course.  Great value for money ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Lovely stay ,
"Upon arrival at the hotel you are greeted with the most amazing smell into the lobby. I arrived very early in the morning but the staff was able to accommodate with no charge. I had access to the Club Lounge and there is an amazing selection and the team working that Club Lounge deserve many kudos. Hazel in particular was someone that just shined and heard many people comment the same around me. It's hard to find that level of customer service and care these days. Additionally, the amenities in hotel are all very nice. I was a bit disappointed with the sun pool as limited sun to bathe but it was still a beautiful space and the 18th floor has 360 views. All in all great value, great location, staff terrific and have customer at the core.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best Hotel in Singapore,
"Great place to stay in. The location is close to city attractions. Rooms are nice, and service excellent. Food options are a little limited, especially if you're vegetarian. However, the chef was nice enough to whip up some dishes on request. Worth a stay, despite being a tad expensive",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent location and service,
"In the heart of the city surrounded by many restuarants,foodcourts,shopping its the place to be with the Esplanade just below the JW Marriott South Bridge 2 stops to Dhoby Ghaut and you are in Orchard another happening place you can go anyway by mrt in a jiffy just change to other lines. I celebrated my birthday here and received a small cake,chocolates & balloons courtesy of the Marriott, a nice experience. Staff was nice and checkin was efficient.

"We just completed a three night stay at this property. I used suite upgrades and got a corner suite along with two standard king rooms (6 people total). Rooms were very good ~ clean, comfortable, well appointed. Staff was excellent from check in through housekeeping and especially the executive lounge team (Hazel is wonderful). Location is key with access to one MRT station at the hotel, and another just a short underground walk (cool AC) away. Pool and bar area on 18th floor are nice and a good place to relax and watch the city. No doubt we would book this property again.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Choice in Singapore,
"This hotel is amazing and offers great rooms, restaurants and the location in the marina area is perfect for visiting the surrounding attractions.

Two infinity pools, one on the top with spectacular views and another that is more of a sunny location. Both are stunning.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing!,
We stayed for few nights at the executive suite. The views of the bay were astounding. Housekeeping on the 2nd day could have been better as in more thorough. There was a long queue for breakfast during the weekend but on weekdays it was not so busy. Breakfast was great with a big selection of food. The executive lounge is specious and one of the staffs (Farrah) was very friendly to make it an enjoyable experience. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A Wonderful Stay,

"When we entered the twin-bed room, we were shocked to see that the room was so small, as well as the twin beds, compared to many other JW Marriott hotels. We needed to walk like a crab to move around in the room. The executive lounge did not appeal to us at all as the layout was confused and not users-friendly and the floorings looked cheap. We stayed in this hotel because we were invited to a wedding dinner at the Grand Ballroom which was walking distance from the hotel lobby. The Grand Ballroom was the only place we appreciated for the fantastic lightings and the extra big screen for video viewing. The only shortfalls was very inconvience for elderly to use the toilets in the basement.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Not qualified to be a 5-star hotel,
"This time we stayed at the JW Marriott property in Singapore and we were not disappointed. The design is right up our alley, clean lines, chrome, glass, mirrors and some awesome carpets. Arrived early in the AM and the room was available for us. Titanium member and I did use my Suite Upgrades that were accepted. I will tell you though, if we didn't get the upgrades, the rooms is amazing just as a regular room. Enjoyed the ammenities of the Executive Lounge. Helpful staff members, Hazel, Melvin and Brandon were always there to greet you and assist as needed. So the hotel is beautiful, but the staff made the trip. Every day you walk in the lobby area and are welcomed by at least 6 different staff members. Made you feel really welcomed.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing Design and Staff,
"I have been a platinum and now titanium elite member for over 9 years. The Executive Lounge at the JW Marriott in Singapore is simply the best I've ever experienced.  The quality and extensive food offerings and the warm service demonstrated by the staff is second to none. Hazel and Melvin greeted me warmly everyday and every evening. They were attentive and anticipated my every need. It was such a lovely experience, especially after coming back after a long day of work.   I cannot say enough about this hotel and the service. I highly recommend!!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best Exec Lounge,
The JW Marriott Hotel in Singapore was clean and the service was excellent.  I lost my connecting flight and arrived a day later from my scheduled reservation.  As a Marriott Bonvoy member I was able to get a refund for the day lost after having spoken to a customer service representative.  The front desk staff was accommodating and did not give me any hassles which could have easily been the case.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Service,
"Rooms are of decent size, my overlooked Raffles which was great. Breakfast was more than expected, great selection, excellent quality, albeit expensive. Used gym on 2 occasions, decent when compared to other hotels. Pool had great views, only downside was the pool was freezing.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Business Trip - Fantastic Hotel,
"The JW Marriott is one of my favorite hotels in Singapore. The design is outstanding, the exterior, the lifts, the hallways and the room itself, it's all very well done. The rooms are quite comfortable (although not too spacious), the staff is lovely and the location is excellent, too. Breakfast is okay, there is quite a lot of choice but nothing that really wowed me.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful stay,
"Hotel staff are friendly and attentive, including the housekeeping personnel Maya, who is friendly and helpful. Service crews in the restaurants were also providing excellent service.  Location of the hotel is perfect. The underpass connecting to various shopping malls, don't have to worry if it is rain or shine. The connecting shopping Malls includes Suntec City, Marina Square and Raffles City. There are 2 subway station within reach. View from the hotel : able to view the whole financial centre from the 18th floor pool, and able to catch glimpse of Singapore Flyer and Garden by the Bay. ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay,
"My wife and I checked in late and were tired but the young man at check in was quick and professional and welcomed us warmly. He even managed an 'upsell' in a very friendly manner which gave us suite and lounge access for a fair price. All staff here are most welcoming and make you feel almost like family. Our room on the 21st floor was awesome, although with a few too many mirrors for my taste( small complaint) Lounge staff were all excellent and the variety of food available was great. This is a newer hotel very close to the MRT and shopping. I would highly recommend this property.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Awesome Hotel- Feel like Royalty!,

"Booked a suite and had lounge access at the JW Marriott Hotel. The hotel smells nice upon entry and had service staff greeting you and showing you the way to the check-in. Check-in process was smooth and the room was wonderful. I particularly liked the executive lounge which provides TWG tea and a variety of snacks during afternoon tea. Breakfast at the Beach Road Kitchen was very packed on the weekend, hence we couldn't have a proper one, with food running out and not replaced swiftly. We opted for another breakfast at the lounge instead. Less variety but a lot more peace. Overall a wonderful stay, thank you.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Terrific and outstanding services!,
"The hotel is superbly situated and works well for business meetings. The meeting rooms are great. The breakfast is fantastic and the lounge is above average, without being extraordinary. The service is somewhat lacking as the room we had had a bathtub that did not work, and a phone out of service. It took forever to get it fixed. Changing room also took a long time as no one was available to help us move stuff around. But the staff were very nice and offered us a bottle of wine which was super nice. The room service is delicious and the swimming pool is great. The decoration is by Starck but a bit tacky .",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Very nice but some issues,
"I don't have a bad word to say about my stay at the Marriott South Beach. From the rooms to the staff to the food, everything was spot on.   The rooms are super modern and spacious with amazing bathrooms. There is a stunning pool on the roof which is the perfect place to watch the sun rise. I got up early one morning and had the whole roof to myself. It was breath-taking.   The staff in the morning at breakfast were fantastic. First of all there was every type of food you can imagine, secondly the service was outstanding. This was hands down the best breakfast offering I've experinced in a long time. I would stay there again purely based on their breakfast!   The hotel also has quick links to public transport and there are a number of restaurants and bars on offer.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Increidble breakfast and stunning rooftop pool,

"Having travled a lot for business around the globle, I can honestly say the JW Marriot has been the best hotel I have stayed in for business or personal.  The level of service I receievd from the moment I walked into the hotel, to the minute I left was exceptional, I could not have asked for a better experience. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were kind, attentive, & polite.  Travelling a lot, hotels do become much of a muchness, however the JW Marriot stands head and shoulders above them all.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wishes to visit Singapore  No question, if and when I return to Singapore, I will be booking the JW",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Business Trip,

"Stayed here for 3 days as layover, it was our first time in Singapore and this hotel is in the area where there's an mrt next to it and a shopping mall close by as well. Check in was quick and easy. Was upgraded to upper floor with the view of the marina. Room are a little modern but comfortable. Enough. Lounge are connected by a walkway on 2nd floor ( if I remember correctly) its huge. Nice to have a quiet zone though. Food choice are good too. Hotel restaurant were outside. So you do have walk a bit but it's all in the shade. Also have alot of food choice from breakfast to dinner. But you can always walk a little to find there are other eateries around close by. Thank you to all staffs for making out stay a great one. Definitely will be the choice hotel if return to Singapore ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay and great hotel,
"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it has never disappointed. As a leisure traveller the city is in easy walking distance or you can hop on the Circle (yellow) Line which is conveniently located next to the hotel. The staff are wonderful and cater for your every need. They make you feel right at home from the minute you walk through the door. The standards in the hotel are definitely 5* that not only includes the staff but the rooms, facilities and food. I cannot fault this hotel and will definitely stay again.

"JW Marriott South Beach is nothing short of awesome. Firstly it is perfectly located: across the road from the Hop on Hop off, walking distance to 2 malls, and public transport (200m) and lots of great restaurants nearby. It's also in walking distance to the Singapore Flyer (2kms) and other attractions, like the Gardens on the Bay.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome, and nothing is too much hassle for them. The Executive lounge is great, with excellent food and great service.  The room we had was quiet and had everything we needed, and then some!  I'd highly recommend this hotel for both tourists and business people as it more than caters for all kinds of travelers.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,WOW!,
"This was our 3rd time to Singapore and stepped it up a notch by staying at the JW Marriott... the hotel location was spot on, the staff were all amazing from our arrival to our departure.   Truly a first class experience, everyone was so accommodating and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a 5* experience in the heart of Singapore.  If you have the opportunity to experience the Executive/Concierge lounge this is again something you don't want to miss.

Also, she made an extra effort to help us with our luggage  while leaving the hotel after departure to the Subway.

"We were given a great room on the top floor with views out over the harbor and Gardens by the Bay. The hotel is fairly new, well-maintained, well managed and an easy walk to several subway stops. We took the 30 minute walk over to Gardens by the Bay with no problems and the river was only about 10 minutes away. Breakfast was excellent and the Executive Lounge may well be worth the extra if your Marriott status doesn't get you in. We didn't use it for breakfast but did try it for afternoon tea and evening hors d'oeuvres. While the food wasn't the best that we've had in a JWM Lounge, service was excellent and more than made up for the somewhat cafeteria-style furnishings.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Stylish hotel in a great location,
"Singapore is an expensive place so having access to the lounge/breakfast is worth considering.  As one would expect, the staff at a Marriott outside of the USA is exceptional, this one included.  This lounge serves fantastic food and drink and the breakfast downstairs is among the best in the world.  We had a corner room with a great view.  The Metro has a stop within a block of the hotel.  I'd like to thank Kwang Sriwaja for her exceptional service and I'd like thank Hazel in the lounge who sometimes made my wife and I feel guilty for having what seemed like a personal servant.   It was a great hotel and a great visit.  It is fantastic service without having a stuffy feel to it.  You can't go wrong by staying at this hotel.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel.

The attention to detail in the room is amazing, my #1 preferred room now (together with JW Marriott in Macau). I had a super good sleep and would come back any time.

Hughes bathroom with big cabins for shower and toilet and a wonderful bathtub together and within the same room as the sink.

"The location of this hotel is right on top of the MRT station with a big shopping mall nearby which can be accessed underground or by skybridge.  The hotel has a lot of artistic decoration, even inside the room, which doesn't look like the normal JW Marriott.  The room is a bit small with a lot of mirror, personally not really like it.   The hotel prepared us a nice anniversary surprise, a wine and a delicious cake. We enjoyed them very much.   There are 2 swimming pools, but very small and fill with Chinese tourist taking photos everywhere.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Nice service and artistic room,
Hotel and staff are great. Rooms and decor a bit strange but works i suppose. Two main bar outlets closed.. on a SATURDAY night ?? Will review bars and restaurants shortly. Tonic the Gin bar great but empty.. choices wonderful,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Modern designer hotel,
" Good location,200 m from a mrt station Hotel public areas are top notch.rooms are very stylish ,large and lavish bathroom with separate bath and shower.the japanese style automatic toilet is fun.the room itself is comparably smallish.liked the style though.the welcome email by marriott seemed to advertise netflix enabled tv ,this was not the case though.the exec lounge is extraordinary,vast f&b offer ,great lounge attendants. Bonvoy platinum treatment however is reduced to less than the minimum required.although there was online availability of upgraded rooms we got a regular room on the lowest floor.so dont expect any upgrade at all unless you want to fight for it which I did not.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Stylish hotel top with flaws,

"I came with my wife carrying 3 luggage and there were no porter helping or assisting.  Foreigner came with small luggage and front desk like a puppet quickly pushing the luggage for them. Room design were ok, but for woman's that need to use hair straighteners or dryers,beware that there are not a single power point in the bathroom. You need to slide the mirror and use the powerpoint for the kettle. Ask for a wine glass, it came wet with hair inside. Complain about it and they gave us a sorry note and 8 bottles of water. We ask to check out 1 day early and wasnt allowed.",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,BAD Service,
"Very new and beautiful hotel, however, not very functional. There is only one hook in the bathroom with no chairs and place to put your clothes. So you are running around feeling quite stupid. Both the swimming pools are small and shallow with one of them used as a bar area. The Japanese restaurant Akira is well worth a try.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel but not very functional,
"I visited JW Marriott with family in December 2018 to celebrate my 30th Birthday.  This brand new hotel is must on any trip to Singapore if it be business or leisure. Close enough to all sights in Singapore with taxi's being very affordable to get around and even central enough to walk to China Town, Little India, Haji Lane and Clarke Quay. A special thanks to the Executive Lounge Staff (Eva, Zen & Hazel) who made my 30th birthday a very special  and memorable experience in Singapore which I will  never forget!! The infinity pool is a lovely place to head in the afternoon and overlook the city. All of the staff at this hotel were very personable, friendly and willing to help.

The combination of the stylish room, location, amenities, and most of all, their STAFF, is top notch.  The staff at this property is absolutely BEST.  From reaching out before my stay, accommodating my request for quiet room with a view, the warm and pleasant nature of the reception desk...  all just top of class.  I wish I know each and every individual by name.  They deserve to be recognized.  Next time, I will get their business   Very clean, very well organized room.

"While this is new luxury hotel with modern architecture and professional service, it is not really for us.   The hotel features some modern arts, but it lacks warmth and charms for families. It mainly caters for business clientele.   The rooms are comfortable and well-maintained.  Breakfast unfortunately is located outside the hotel - across the courtyard. The food selection are plenty but tastes average.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,New modern hotel near Marina area,

"Hotel fresh, modern and very, very trendy in decor. Very attentive and courteous staff at all levels, whether at reception, room service or executive lounge, which, by the way, is pretty well stocked in offerings and pleasantly quiet for work on your PC.  Most customary services available. Rooms large and very spacious, with the bathroom of a good and satisfactory size.  Only one not so clever detail: MIRRORS EVERYWHERE!!! Not everyone wants a constant real time reminder of what they look like! Just saying!",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Small Not so Clever Detail,
"The location of the hotel was awesome and you get a great weekend at the pool on 18 floor. The room was spacious but the king bed was a bit small though it is fairly comfortable. Nice bathtub and bathroom. Except there is no nespresson in the room.   The fruit juices at the lounge was good. The selection of the food there is pretty decent.  Overall the service was good. If it is your first time in Singapore, it is a good place to stay.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Nice hotel at an awesome location,
The hospitality from all of the staff in this hotel is second to none.  The Executive lounge was amazing with an assortment of dishes to please every guest.  The food was exceptional and I tried many new foods while visiting Singapore.  The hotel was centrally located to everything and within walking distance to almost everything.  The rail system was convenient and a great way to see the rest of the country.  One of the safest and cleanest countries that I have been to in the world!,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Outstanding staff hospitality and great location!,
"Great hospitality that never fails to surprise me. Love their personal touch and small gesture. Even from the housekeeping and the technician also never fails to surprise me. The toilet cover was malfunction and I lodge a feedback. After it was repaired, he left a note and a cute LEGO man, put a smile on me after I see that! Good job! Even the housekeeping also very caring and anticipating my needs. I left my laptop charger on the desk and guess what she left behind and even with a personalized hand written note! She left behind screeen/lens wipes! Good job Dina. All of the small gesture really counts to make us feel at home and welcomed. Needless to say about the bath tub with aroma salt that elevates your tiredness and their comfy bed strategically located near to bugis.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hospitality from all staff and comfy bed in strategic location,

"Overall, we were impressed with this hotel. The concierge (especially Debbie) and the front desk staff were very helpful. She was able to put together a New Year's Eve package for our family at the last minute.  However, our family needed something and called from our room to request it but unfortunately Pamela gave us attitude which was very disappointing and unprofessional. Also, we left behind 2 bags of laundry in the built-in closet and it was never recovered.   The location was good considering that you have to get a Taxi or Grab to go to most places in Singapore. The view from the 18th floor pool deck was stunning. The rooms were nicely decorated but a bit on the small side.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A good choice.,
"Everyone in the Executive Lounge was just amazing in their customer focus.  Not to mention the excellent food, drinks (coconut juice!), and fruits.  Special mention to Hazel and Chef Nino.

"We stayed the weekend in Singapore as part of a business trip through Southeast Asia.  The Singapore South Beach hotel was in an ideal location, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel offers convenient access to the Mass Rapid Transit, and is only a short walk from the wonderful restaurants along Marina Bay.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the accommodations very comfortable.  Don't forget to check out the amazing views from the pool on the 18th floor!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful,
"Reached a bit early and luckily Reuben at front desk intervened to accommodate me with a nice room. This allowed for a good stay over 3 nights to see clients and speak at the Singapore FinTech Festival.  The breakfast manager compensated to rectify some offhand curt behaviour at check in initially. Again Reuben had helped.  Great breakfast, good concierge and good front desk. Best of all great tea making facilities, nice bathrooms and always stocked with 2 bottles of free drinking water.    Maintains the high standards of the J W Marriott franchise.

Anyone going to Singapore should definitely stay in JW South beach. The hotel has chic white interiors and amazing view of Merlion.  I spent 5 nights in Marriot and stay was nothing but comfortable! Location is perfect with major attractions within walking distance. The pool has a breathtaking view of Marina bay  during night. The highlight for me was TOTO Toilets in all the rooms( which is usually found in suites of other brands). Overall the stay was really comfortable and I'll definitely book this property again when I'm in Singapore.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing property with Perfect location and TOTO Toilet,
"This Marriott location is perfect! Easy access to the shopping and attractions, all within walking distance.

There are 2 pools on the property, the pool on the 18th floor has superb views of the bay. The executive lounge is open to members for breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktail hour.

The staff in this hotel is incredible.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect in every way!,
"Traveling with family from US: the hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff recognized me as a Platinum member, and I was upgraded to a swanky suite with amazing views. The highlight of the hotel is the swimming pool on the 18th floor; it is an infinity pool with amazing views of the city. Couple of minor suggestions to the hotel staff: - consider heating the water in the swimming pool it was a tad bit cold. Also recommend, continue to work on managing the restaurant crowd during the late breakfast hours: it was a bit frantic.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Charming Luxury with impeccable service ,

The airline china air allows use of the machine but unknown to me you meed your own power pack not plug in outlet like other airlines  i need to sleep well.  Gary at concierge worked for 2 days to dind the machine at half price.  I want to thank him very much.  Watson at the buffet restaurant was amazing  he is the chef assistant and made you feel like you were at his house for dinner.

"This is a typical international JW.  The facility is clean and well-designed, rooms are large and comfortable, and the service is superb.  It is within walking distance to essentially everything in Singapore, including the Marina area, Arab Street, and Little India.  The JW restaurants are pricey and not great, but there are many other choices within an easy walk.  The concierge lounge is excellent, one of the best I have seen.  There was a great deal of noise one night (a wedding reception perhaps?), but otherwise it was reasonably quiet.  I imagine higher floors are quieter, further from city streets.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Good Choice in Singapore,
Rooms- a bit too small For the regular Mariott users feel cramped at times. Ask for a higher floor always Cleanesss- without a doubt good Lights- for some reason each of the rooms had a crazy green ligt not sure whats the intention but if u r here for business after a days work the lights do tend get u dizzy Food- average although i didnt explore many options but nearby u do have a good variety to Go explore restaurants and pubs Close from the esplanade metro stop  The best part about this place is the view from roof top. Its worth visiting and spending a few hours watching singapore night life lit up.   Also check the madarin before u book this place. They pretty much provide the same rates but i think the service is more prompt and quicker there. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Pleasant experience ,
We enjoyed out visit  to Singapore and this hotel so much last November  we decided to return again last month.   Thank you for another fantastic stay at the hotel.

"We stayed three nights at the hotel. We loved the infinity pool on the 18th floor, it had great views of the city as well as the Sands Hotel. Our room was small but with a good view and very functional. The concierge lounge had a good breakfast and afternoon happy hour with food, but the lounge itself is down on its luck. It is dark, stark and in need an upgrade. Being on the second floor is also a draw back since it has not view.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A nice trip and good service,
housekeeper refused to take sin$50 tip that i left in bathroom. it was my mistake thinking i gave $5. instead he left a long handwritten note to welcome me to Singapore n enjoy.

This is one more nice Marriott hotel. It's always a pleasure to stay in the Marriott group accommodations. This is no exception. Nice decor exterior. Excellent cleanliness. Room was very comfortable and relaxing. There were so many good selections for breakfast that one is spoiled for the choices. I really enjoyed my stay there.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Nice Hotel with Friendly staffs,
Check in process needs to be reviewed. Arrived at 3 pm as check in time but did not get a room until 4.30pm. Mobile app sent via email did not work for me- did not detect the room booking. Internet speed is very slow in the room. Had to resort to using the 4G network. I think the hotel is overpriced for the service provided. However room view is great overseeing the marina bay & padang. Gym is well equipped. Located near Raffles city & Suntec shopping areas. ,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Experience ,
"This is my second time, and better experience as I learnt from my last. The lower floor rooms can be dingy due to the facade of the building. Try to stay above level 18. I requested and hotel kindly put me on the 21st floor. There are some observations on inroom Dinning. I was unhappy with quality and quantity of food 3 of 4 times of order. The good thing is that they listen, in fact their team lead GIGI came to apologise and indulged with some nice dessert and wine later. Second feedback is air conditioning in the gym which is terrible. I remember i had mentioned in my last review and also others had too. So feedback continues. Also they are very rigid to access to lounge. Strictly platinum only.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Good experience,
I have stayed here several times but the latest stay was even better than normal. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Two examples - when cleaning my room while I was working on my laptop I was given several packets of screen wipes and at breakfast in the Executive lounge by the fourth day the gentleman cooking the eggs/omelettes brought me my normal fried eggs over easy with bacon without my asking for it. In fact the continual smiling greetings are almost OTT. My only criticism is that the metal chairs are not that comfortable. I look forward to my next stay.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great service and comfortable rooms,
"The JW Marriott was awesome! The room and amenities were top notch, the room service was timely, the restaurant offered great food, and the bar had a bartender who gave us great cocktails and tips that made our stay even more enjoyable.

"This is the third time in 12 months we have stayed at the JW Marriott and the fact that we have returned speaks volumes for the quality of service we have experienced . Attention to detail from all levels of staff from housekeeping to reception is exceptional; this is a hotel that welcomes you as a person and not number and provides a professional level of service. The quality and range of food from Beach Road Kitchen and the Executive Lounge is fantastic and I would recommend opting for these services. This is a hotel that has a unique modern ambience, set within a complex of luxury sophistication and is a must stay venue for this wishing to be in the hub of the Marina / Colonial area.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Exceptional Service,

"My husband and I had a 23 hour stopover in Singapore last month.  We were lucky enough to stay at the JW Marriott!  The hotel is incredibly modern and the amenities are just to-die-for.  We could have been content never leaving the hotel! We had access to the executive lounge, and Eva and Hazel were extremely accommodating throughout.  Both Hazel and Eva ensured that we had the greatest day planned showing us all the right spots to hit, even with just a few hours in gorgeous Singapore.  We could not be more thankful!

"From registration until the moment I left, everything was perfect.  Due to being a loyal SPG member I was immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite which was spacious and very comfortable.  It was only on the 4th floor so the view was nothing to write home about but everything else was spot on.  The entire staff was very friendly and super helpful.  The executive lounge food and drinks were awesome, as was the lounge staff and chef.  The hidden jewel that was not heavily advertised was the pool on the 6th floor (roof) of the second building.  The water was warmer, it was never crowded, it was relaxing and had a spectacular view.  I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to be able to stay there again.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect 30 day stay,

Its lobby was artistic and creative that I was much impressed with the candle-lit decoration hanging from the ceiling, not to mention its fashionable furniture and aesthetic ornaments along the hallway. My room was also spacious and trendy, with large french window to capture city view, and my neat and bright bathroom was well-equipped with separate bathtub and shower space. There were also a large gym and a rooftop swimming pool in the hotel, but I had a tight schedule in Singapore and had no time to enjoy them.

"Lobby set up changed a bit from my last stay six months ago, but still looks fabulous..The Executive Lounge on the second floor seems to have hired more people & hence the service is very good; menu also expanded. The pool on the 18th floor with a view to die for & the ""coffee shop"" with the fantastic service is something that cannot be be replicated elsewhere in Singapore. But what essentially differentiates one great hotel from another is its people & here JW Marriott South Beach's people are outstanding.. they bend backwards to help you, & this applies to each & every department that I came in contact with...",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,This was my third stay in less than two years..gets better each time !,
"Enjoyed my staycation over the weekend with my girls! The hotel was located in a perfect area... Johnny did the check in for us. He was extremely helpful and went through registration with us smoothly. Thank you for the lovely stay!   Shoutout to the super sweet and polite room attendant on the 20th floor. Also not forgetting Rueben during night shift... he assisted my friend and I patiently when we needed assistance with our room key! Lastly, Yati from AYS, she was helpful and detailed when I asked for Wifi assistance.  Overall, beautiful hotel! Will def come back again! Thank you.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Sweet staycation!,
"The interior was pleasing to the eyes because it was unique, modern and very creatively curated.   Service was 10/10. My room was always clean, check out was quick and the staff were always ready to assist. I recall feeling unsafe walking back to my room one night (perils of being a lone female traveller), and the staff were more than helpful in offering an escort.  The rooms were clean, stocked with quality toiletries and tea. Unfortunately, it was rather small compared to some other hotels I've stayed in. Granted, I had a long corridor, but the room was generally quite small for a Marriott. Nevertheless, I'd highly recommend staying in this hotel if you have the chance, it was an experience ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Unique interior, great service",
"I am staying in the JW Marriott at the moment and so far I am having a great time! Thank you to the staff Hazel, Jacquelyn, Melvin and Jollie and the chef Nino for the best service and great food here at their Executive Lounge.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing stay,
"Amazing hospitality, awesome food... what more can I ask? Hazel and the crew at the executive lounge knocked it out of the park. Very lovely staff. The flow 18 pool is really beautiful as well! Will be back again!!   Thank you!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best experience ever,
"The JW Marriott is situated in the Singapore Marina District just minutes walk to shopping malls, high-end eateries, and scenic attractions.  If you just want to relax in the Spa or eat in one of the many high-end restaurants or swim in one of the 2 infinity pools, then you don't even have to leave the hotel.  The staff at the executive lounge great you warmly every day and make you feel like royalty.  They jump at the chance to serve you!  Thank you Hazel and Chef Ray who even made a French toast for our breakfast even though it wasn't on the buffet options.  My husband I will definitely chose this hotel for our next Singapore stay.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,The JW Marriott brand is finally in one of the best districts.,
"It's a great five star hotel with all necessary top notch fivesrar services, located conveniently close to MRT and city center and Suntec City shopping mall.   Unfortunately the non city view rooms have mediocre view and window cleanliness.   The biggest downside is the stuffy A/C, which also fluctuates in temperature a lot, giving you a non restful night. ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Convenient location, mediocre view, stuffy A/C",
"Booked this hotel for a birthday celebration. Upon arrival (1615pm), I spent about 30mins checking in, only to inform me that room was not ready due to some technical issues and that they would need 20mins to fix it. 20mins passed, room was not ready yet. Check in time is at 1500pm and rooms should be ready by then? Managed to check in at 1730pm.   Hotel buffet was terrible with limited choices. Bad check out experiences as well.   Worst hotel experience that I ever had. ",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Poor hotel management/ customer service ,
"I stayed at JW Marriott South Beach just for one night and were extremely happy with the stay. Hotel is well located near MRT station, Nicoll Highway and within walking distance to Marina Bay. My room has executive lounge access. The lounge opens till midnight with breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktail and refreshments. Room is new and clean. Bathroom is awesome. Check in and check out are smooth. As a Gold member I am able to enjoy late check out until 3pm. Will come back again.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful stay,
"the JW South beach is in a perfect location in Singapore, 20 minutes drive from the airport, Singapore MRT less than 1 minute away, Short cab ride to the Sands/Marina Bay, nice variety of eateries, awesome view from the 18th floor and a free perch to watch the awesome fireworks displays from the Sands. The staf  is top knotch from check in, to executive lounge to housekeeping. Always a smile, nod of the head or a hand wave. They go out of their way to provide outstanding service, making it your home away from home...you won't regret booking a stay here!!! Enjo...",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great Views, Location and Staff",
"JW marriot charged $50 after my checkout which was not consumed by myself. I try to contact the help desk, after few calls they still want to investigate this matter. moreover the hotel is not spacious and not in the right location compared to other marriots.",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Bill after checkout,
"My husband and I stayed here for the F1 and we were treated like family/treasured friends by all staff at all times. Nothing was too much trouble and we were greeted with a friendly smile and hello from everyone we encountered. Can't wait to book again - thank you for making our trip so special!  By comparison, we went to another hotel for our last night in Singapore and apart from the scenic pool (I'm sure you can guess where we went....) the service left a lot to be desired.  Thank you JW Marriott team, you're great!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing Experience!,
"Booked the JW Marriott for my wife's birthday. I booked a high floor with MBS view which I was charged extra for. When arrived the room was not ready, waited in lounge for more than 2 hours for the room, got the keys for the wrong room, the room we ordered and paid for was not available, staff was unprofessional, compensation that was offered was never received, a small gift for my wife that I ordered was only received late night (too late and not relevant anymore), etc.  It was one of the worst & most frustrating stays I ever had.  I expected to get a much better service as a Platinum Elite Premier customer of Marriott. Very disappointing",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Terrible stay - ruined my wife's birthday,
Here on the F1 weekend and the staff at the executive lounge are very friendly and welcoming.Hazel was the one serving me and my friends and she never fails to come round our table with a bright smile and ensuring that we have enough drinks. Great service at a really nice executive lounge right smack in the middle of all the F1 fever,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent service and experience,
"One the best JW Marriott I visited  Beautiful property excellent location  Nicest staff lot of restaurant on property and near by , rooms little small but bathroom spacious very modern with latest technology I like their elevator brilliant idea with the lights and music ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wow what a hotel,
"We stayed at this hotel  and must say that the hotel staff is very good and service level is one of the best in Hotel Industry.   Chef Ray, Chef Siddarth , Guest Services - Anne, Angelina , Rafiq, Hazel and all other names we cannot remember made our stay very special.  The Team enjoys taking good care of guests .  We would be staying again when in Singapore at this Hotel.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Hotel Staff and Service is Excellent,
"Hotel is located at the core of the city and well connected to the MRT Esplanade and City Hall.  I had the deluxe room which was SunTek facing, rooms are clean and neat but little small as compared to what Marriott standards are. There is very little space between the TV and the King Bed. I asked the hotel to change the room as the one allotted earlier had no view at all. Best is to take a higher floor with the City View.  Hotel staff was very nice and courteous. The hotel is almost fully occupied as it is a new one and the Marriott brand of course.  The infinity pool is a good and has a amazing view from the top.   Overall a good hotel to stay and go around the city. Recommended for Business Travelers.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Comfortable Stay,
Well I don't have to say much about this hotel. I had best experience of my life when I stayed here. Everything is very good and well organized.  The hotel staff is even more friendly and super awesome. They welcomed me with a welcome drink and made sure that the check-in process is smooth.  The room was very comfortable with mini bar. Washrooms were automatic. So needed to spend a little time to figure out.  And the breakfast was finger licking. I ordered American breakfast with poached eggs. It was above my expectations. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing experience,
"My stay at JW Marriott has been exceptionally satisfactory and I would like to extend my gratitude to Hazel, Jollie, Jack, Melvin, Shafiq, Rio, Esther and Chef Nino for their wonderful service whilst I was at the Executive Lounge. I would also like to give my thanks to Tal, the front desk manager who was very polite and was able to help me with any concerns we had.   Also, I would also like to mention the service at Beach Road Kitchen especially, Honey, Flora, Alex, Chef Jackie and Susan who had made my evening there more gratifying than usual.  Thank you for making my visit here pleasant with exceptional service and also a beautiful view.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,The view was as great as their service,
"Stayed here for work for 2 weeks and the service, facilities were fantastic.  Close to marina, great walking options and food all around.  Work booked the exec package which allows access to exec mtg room, light good - breakfast, afternoon light food and supper with bar included.  Rooms were large and views were good.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Executive Package,
"While I visit Singapore, often, this was my first time staying here.  Much good, and a bump or two.  To start, the mirror are impressive.  My room was quiet, if not a bit tight with the desk chair.  Check-in was slower than I would have hoped for, in a very narrow lobby.  Food options in the attached mall are numerous for dinner, which is a plus.  I had a nice breakfast in the Executive Lounge, meeting partners there.  Staff were friendly.  I will likely try the hotel again for my next visit.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Good Location for Food Options,
"The hotel is a walking distance from Merlion (not vey near but walkable). The staff is so nice and breakfast spread is great, it is like never ending. The location of the hotel is also good.  The only con I can think of is the room size. It is really small but it is the issue with all hotels in Singapore. So, can't complain much.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great stay,
"The location and service set this hotel apart.  Everything is within walking distance.  When we couldn't figure out which exit and direction to go to catch the double-decker tour bus, the front desk staff walked us over and made sure we knew how and where to catch the bus.  The desk staff gave excellent dinner recommendations as well.  The rooms are very nice albeit very small.  The club level offers food and drinks several times/day.  The breakfast buffet was very good.  Would definitely stay again if ever in Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel in excellent location,
"Stayed three nights here in early August on the way back from Vietnam; first time at this property and overall impressed; the only issue was the check in- the lobby is fundamentally too small for the purpose and lent a slightly bad vibe to the start of the stay; from then on it was all upside; the lounge is a great facility, well worth the additional cost if you like a couple of beers in the evening and a good breakfast; staff all very friendly and competent; room was of good size, and location wise very convenient to walk to Marina Bay for the shops and Casino and the MRT uptown. Pools were good but slightly on the cold side and generally sunless; that said, great views.  Overall would stay again.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A pleasant change,
Visited with my family for vacation. Ms. Hazel at Executive Lounge took care of us very much and talked to us very friendly. Thanks to her we could have some cozy time at the hotel. Room was not as big as expected but toilet was equipped washlet!!!!!! That automatic shower toilet is used everywhere in Japan but we hardly can find it abroad. We are very happy for that.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Friendly staff at Executive Lounge,
"We stayed here for a birthday celebration. The location is right at the center of Singapore. There were a lot of guests checking in and out as it was a long weekend in Singapore so the lobby was really busy. They should have opened more counters when they saw the crowd.  Also, their hotel lobby itself is a bit confusing. But nonetheless, our overall staycation experience was still great. Our room was big enough, and the club lounge was exceptional. The staffs at the club lounge were very accomodating, special thanks to Hazel and Jollie for making us feel very special. Would definitely come back again",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Stay at JW Marriott,
"Breakfast line was long, and items run out... In my last stay, there was a power outage... Was stuck in my room with no aircon, and could not even go down from my level (as the lifts were not working)... Have never experienced this in a 5-star hotel. Atrocious!",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Very so-so for a JW Marriott,
"An excellent new Marriott property near the Marina.   Get a downtown-facing room for the view of your life.  Marriott really went above an beyond on this property, not missing a single detail or touch of luxury.  The in-room bathtubs are amazing. And be sure to check out the 18th floor pool deck. It doesn't get great sun, but the bar and view will keep you entertained all day if you so choose.   This hotel makes it hard to leave to go explore the city as it's just a great place to chill.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Cozy room with a view,
"We stayed here for several days in January 2018.  Apparently the hotel has been refurbished very recently and the style is modern, possibly at the expense of comfort in some instances.  The staff were pleasant enough but there was no sense of  truly friendly personal welcome.  It is very handy for the hop on hop of buses though and is in a very good location generally.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Very modern refurbishment,
"we had the pleasure of staying at JW Marriott Singapore at the end of July for 5 days. We utilized the executive lounge for breakfast as well as in the afternoon . I would like to compliment the staff here,especially, Hazel who was a total delight. Friendly and helpful at all times, but also honest. My husband had put cash in his pocket rather than in his wallet. This slipped out, and it was Hazel who quickly advised us , that this had occurred. To the management, this is one employee who you really need to utilize, she is a  Great ambassador for the hotel",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,executive lounge,
Did a few days sight seeing and relaxing in Singapore. Hotel is well located between Marina Bay sights and Orchard shopping. Also next door to the main terminal for the Hop On and Off bus tour helped us get our bearings on the first day. Very helpful reception and concierge.  Only downside was the bar and restaurant was fiendishly expensive. We ended up buying some wine at a local supermarket for 10th of the price having said that breakfast was excellent. Great base for sight seeing as there are so many amazing places to eat and explore in Singapore.,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great location,
"The hotel is relatively new and the facilities are great. The lounge is nice with a good spread of food items in the evening. I am specifically writing this to compliment few exceptional customer service oriented employees i met in the lounge. Ms. Jollie Anne Reventar, the greeter is very kind, smiling always and super helpful. When I checked in to the hotel, she helped me rest and get a drink while she made all the arrangements to get my luggage, checking in etc. Another nice employee was Ms. Esther, she was tending the bar in the lounge. She was also friendly and smiling and making the all the customers feel welcome. Overall, people like this make a difference when you are staying at a place that is not your home. Thank you Marriott for employing people like this.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Employees are super nice, friendly and warm",
"Check-in was easy.  Room decor not our taste, but fine for what it was.  Executive lounge had great service, food and drink range - nothing was too much trouble for any staff member.  Special mention to Hazel and Chef Junkiat who went out of their way to see we were looked after.  Good view from our room.  Best views however from the pool levels.  Pools were never busy - reason, they were cold.  Good central location.  Close to many shopping centres and RMT.  Would we stay there again, yes.  ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay - Friendly staff,
Staff created such a welcoming atmosphere.  No request was too difficult and you were always treated with a smile.  In particular Azmi the Bellhop stood out as someone who was there to assist as best he can.  Thank you for creating such a wonderful stay.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fanstastic Staff,
"Highly recommend JW Marriott foe business and leiaure, we stayed a week for a conference and cant speak highly enough of the hotel ans staff. Perfectly located, immaculate rooms and amenities- level 18 pool and view are stunning.

It was fully served with smile and hospitality one do not usual get. Food and snacks served all day long, it is comfortable and Cousy.

"Decided to give JW a try for our wedding anniversary celebration. We got ourselves an Executive suite with the Marina Bay view.   The rooms were nicely decorated, with good considerations of effective use of space for very functional usage. The marina view was great.  We enjoyed the pool view at both level 6 and 18. We managed to spend a relaxing afternoon out in the pool.  The executive lounge was a bit of the disappointment. The tea break spread was rather limited and lack of the ""grab and go"" snacks. The couches and sofa  cleaniness would definitely need improvements. Can see leftover crumbs, stains. Other than that, the service staff were all very friendly and always serving with a smile.   Overall, it was a great staycation.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wedding Anniversary Staycation ,
"Amazing hotel.  Rooms are comfortable, hotel is beautiful and the service is impeccable.  The view from the pool is outstanding.  Great bars and restaurants right there.  Wish I was able to stay more than one night.  Will be back if I have another trip.  Highly recommend staying here.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wish I was able to stay longer ,
"The staff at the JW Marriott were exceptional, nothing was too much trouble during my stay last week. From an unexpected early checkin (a day before schedule) to late checkout and everything in between. Stella personally escorted me to the Lounge while I waited for my room to be ready for my early check in then escorted me up to my room when it was available. Melvin bent over backwards to work out ways he could assist me offering a variety of suggestions as to what I should do during my time in Singapore and sourced information for us. Kwang was very personable too. The whole stay was most enjoyable and it is the staff that made a difference in this hotel.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful staff,
"My family and I met in Singapore and stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach.  What a beautiful hotel, full of friendly staff and unusual and interesting architecture.  The rooms were well appointed and medium sized, the gummy candies at the entrance tasty, and the concierge club well done.  The views from the pool of the city were spectacular.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing Stay,
It was our first time visiting Singapore. Once we arrived at the hotel we were greeted very nicely and very politely. They made us feel very welcomed and made the check in experience very smoothed. We needed to upgrade our room as the one we ordered was small but once upgrade the excuteice lounge was included in the package which made the experience even better. Chef Dharma and the barman Yogesh were extremely nice and made sure our food and drinks were good. The service team in the executive lounge were super friendly and very nice! I would defo recommend this hotel and would defo book again,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,First time in Singapore,
"JW Marriott  provides a new description to 5 star luxury. From reservation till checkout, it was an awesome experience. We were early and got an upgrade with late check out. The staff treats all guests like royal family. Ruben in the front office needs a special mention. Now it's a home away from home. Spacious and great interior. Worth the price  Repeat visit is not an option.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing luxury in Singapore ,
"Our family was stayed in the suite for a short staycation. Check in was fast, service was alright. The size of the suite is the most generous we have stayed ( comparable to Capella suite ), and I love the decor of the suite and the whole hotel, it's fun and quirky and those unique designer furnitures they use... the all white concept bathroom, the club lounge. There were 2 pools but both was slightly too small and the walkway was kinda narrow so when the water splashed onto the ground it was quite slippery and dangerous as my baby slipped when walking. Also, The food taste can be improved ( both room service and breakfast ). But it still I love almost everything about the hotel. It will be our fam's best choice when we were looking for suite room for staycation.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best staycation if not best suite room,
"I came to the Marriott with high hopes based on recommendations.  Great location and the hotel looked fantastic from the website and reviews.  This was not to be. The check in process was crazy, which I can easily forgive. But not the room. First, the power points would not work and secondly the doorbell would go off at all hours of the night, making me jump out of bed, thinking someone was at the door. This happened twice on first night, and then on the further nights. I complained, and nothing was done about this for 3 days! Despite repeated complaints. And there was no feedback from staff as to whether it had been fixed, nor was there any apology. It has left a very bad impression and I am unlikely to stay Marriott again. There are better options out there.",1.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Worst hotel experience ever,
"This is a real magnificent hotel! Location perfect, close to restaurants, shopping malls and - important - easy access to the mrt (metro) system. All reachable through underground walkeable areas. The hotel has two swimming pools, which are great. For frequent guests there is the Exec lounge, where breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks are served. Extremely friendly employees. The rooms are good and spacious.  I have stayed here several times and each some employees walk the extra mile. This stay I was impressed by Sara, the Indian doorman. He always correctly anticipates your next wish. He is really a jewel at the doir. Another employee at the Reception area - Keith - was more than making sure his guests were comfortable.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,June 2018 stay,
Price: Reasonably priced for offerings. Room: Decent size depending on which layout you get Location: Centrally located beside Esplanade metro. Walking distance to City Hall metro.

"Stayed at the JW Marriott in Singapore for 10 days and were very impressed with the level of service, location and amenities of this hotel. We had access to the executive lounge which exceeded all expectations and felt like an all inclusive resort with breakfast, afternoon tea, evening hors de hors d'oeuvres and cocktails included. We honestly did not need any other food or beverages during our stay and the quality of these and friendliness of the staff surpassed all expectations. I must give a mention to Hazel in the lounge, she went above and beyond to make our experience a memorable one. We would definitely stay here again when we next visit Singapore and highly recommend this hotel. It truly is a 5 star experience!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Very Impressed!,

"This was a trip to remember for me. Staff were amazing, friendly and always willing to chat. We met the manager while sitting in foyer and had no idea he was the manager. Very easy flowing conversation as he asked if we were ok which lead onto our trip for the day then into how we feel so comfortable with staff. At tbis point he advised that he is the manager and was extremely happy with our comments. Conversation went into what we do and where we were all from. Just loved it there and I can only say if going to Singapore stay here. I am looking forward to staying again.  Keep up the great work team.  Cheers  Steve and Angela",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Stay for our Anniversary ,
"After a hectic four weeks in the UK & Ireland we opted for some extra days in Singapore to recharge on the way home.  We opted for the Executive Package which included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. While it was an additional cost, it was well worth it. The staff that ""manned"" the dining room area were extremely friendly and made you feel so welcome, especially Hazel - she is a great asset to this hotel as is Alvin from the bar & reception.  The beds were comfy, the shower & bathroom areas large and our room had views over towards the Marina.  A most enjoyable stay.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Luxury With Great Service,
"The room & communal facilities were spotlessly clean and well maintained, as expected for a high end hotel. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff - you will be greeted by every staff member that you pass, and they are all very friendly and ready to help with any queries that you may have.  The executive lounge is a haven!  Bright, spacious, comfortable and well staffed, you can enjoy a peaceful breakfast, afternoon tea (fresh baked scones with jam & cream) as well as light fare in the evening. If you are lucky you will be greeted by Hazel, who will make you feel like you've found a new best friend.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great service and location,
"I stayed here on business but can see it being equally suitable to tourists. It's a very well located (near the main tourist sites and well located for the business district), relatively recently constructed, comfortable and quiet hotel. I was in a large, comfortable and spacious room on a relatively high floor (9) and can say the noise from outside was non-existent.  If you have executive lounge (with its excellent breakfast) access then you also get 2 free pieces of laundry a day (which is a perk I have never seen before and highly approve of). The staff are extremely nice.  Can't think of a criticism!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel for business or tourism,
"I stay 2 weeks due to Business travel. the service is really great. Hotel location is perfect, not too noisy, there is a mail in front of hotel , you can find good food there.

Enjoyed the stay and the hotel is very well located   5 mins walk from suntec exhibition hall and lots of eatery  The room was great and had a nice view of the padang  While the staff are extremely helpful some of the front desk staff are relatively new and not fully familiar with all aspects   But on the whole they ensured that the correct info is conveyed within a short period   I enjoyed the stay,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Nice hotel and well located,
"I stayed for 3 nights with a friend and what an amazing experience we had, we were welcomed warmly and given a refreshing drink while waiting to book in,mind you we were very early but nothing was a problem.We were given our beautiful room early so we could rest up after a long flight.The staff rated a 10 out of 10 well done Marriott you have an awesome team, our room was amazing and the ammenities were first class.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to be treated with above service ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,5 star all the way,
I have been curious to stay at this designer's hotel. Young and fun design with art everywhere. Modern room & facilities. Comfortable beddings. Love the club lounge. They say it is the largest in Singapore and I believe that. So spacious. Highly recommended to book room at club floors. Gym opens 24 hours. The pool is rather small but acceptable. Love also the open air bar on top floor (next to the gym). The hotel is located at South Beach Rd. Easy to move around. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect. ,

"This Marriott hotel was unlike any Marriott I stayed at. Not only was it beautiful, CLEAN and well run but the staff was polite, friendly, and did everything they could to make your stay Memorable.

"I been in this property end of May 2018 for a two days business trip: location is simply perfect - well connected with subway and in a very good place if you want to walk around to MBS and quite close to airport. Room design is really lovely and is a good mix of modern with the business meeting part that is an colonial building just in front of Raffles hotel. A mention should go to the services provided and in particularly to the executive lounge... it's simply fantastic, one of the best exec lounge I ever been around the world... either for the stylish, the services, the quality and variety of food!  This is now becoming my location every time I will pass from Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A must location when in SIN,
Stunning hotel just to the north of Marina Bay. Beautifully decorated interior. The bar on level 18 has some of the nicest views over Singapore. We were particularly thankful for the excellent friendly service with a smile in the executive lounge from Hazel and Virginia! ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing,
"Every time I come back to this hotel, also discovered their improvements including their service, environment, etc. and gives me a feel that I'm back to my home.  The location is very convenience, there is MRT, walking distance to Suntec. Really good for shopping.  Also, don't miss our the swimming pool at Flow 18, the view is excellent!  ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,My favourite hotel in Singapore,
"I really love this hotel. Everything here is so good. I came here 2 times until now. Room, service, restaurants and the stuff are so nice. I hope I can come back again and again. If you want to come to Singapore don't forget this hotel is best here.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Best hotel in Singapore,
"- Service / Staff are very good and professional - Location is best.  Right next to Suntec City / Train stations.  Don't worry about raining too, it's all covered - The hotel does not generally include breakfast, so you need to buy it separately. - The room is good, but I just don't like the deco, it's just personal taste.  The painting, mirrors etc...   There is a human shape shade (part of the deco) on the wall, when I turn off the light, it's a bit ... you know.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Service / Excellent Location / Close to shopping / Does not include Bfast,
"Nice spacious rooms, good views, 2 pools, great executive lounge with a range of snacks in the evening and afternoon tea in the afternoon.  The breakfast at this hotel is amazing - covers all tastes and is self service.  Largest range of breakfast items I have ever seen in any hotel and I travel a lot.  Very friendly staff.  Very quick laundry service.  Easy access to shops and trains.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel with very helpful and friendly staff,
"Situated close to the Conference Centre with easy access to the MRT staying at The JW Marriott provided the effortless best of all worlds. The breakfast buffet is so extensive that despite a 7 day stay we did not manage to get through all choices. The classy Madame Fan dining room situated within the NGO Club is attached to the hotel and a wide range of mall eating is easily accessible.The staff are attentive and friendly, the welcome is warm and nothing is too much trouble. Sound proofing within the rooms is excellent providing for a great nights' sleep in a very comfy bed within a well appointed room. The 18th floor pool, gym and bar/food facilities with wide  360 degree views across Singapore are so enjoyable.L lovely hotel, a wonderful stay - we will be back",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A Bright Gem,
"This hotel was recently renovated so everything is in top-notch condition. The rooms are new, sheets/blankets felt fresh and new. The pool had a decent view though was a bit small personally for my tastes.  Location was a little out of the way relative to other hotels clustered around the marina, however the fact that it was inside of a complex which included a lot of restaurants and shops made up for it.  My only nit-pick would be that room service was incredibly inconsistent. One day I came back at 4pm and my room had still not been cleaned. Additionally I greatly enjoyed the truffle potato chips in the mini-bar but this was not replaced after first consumption (while other items in the mini-bar were).",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Recently renovated property in fantastic condition,
"We received an upgrade, the facilities and decor are the wow factor, I had a small issue with an account due to breakfast being included, the staff were great in sorting it out promptly. The food at this hotel was exceptional. Good gym.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic hotel,
"This hotel is located in the heart of the Marina. The subway, the Suntech convention centre, national gallery and sightseeing tours are nearby. The food at the hotel is excellent and very healthy. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful. They gave me suggestions for restaurants and things to see nearby. The highlight of my trip was the SPA. It was a phenomenal experience. They have so many services that really help you relax. The hotel is made of 3 buildings and has to two infinity pools, one in the shade and one is the sun. There are services for Children as well and a candy bar when you come into the hotel. Very exciting. If I had to stay here again, I definitely would. Absolutely loved and highly recommend it.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,The place to stay in Singapore,
"This is a very new hotel in a great location.  The room was great, and the staff on the accommodation side were fabulous.  We stayed there over the Mothers Day weekend and I made the mistake of thinking the hotel breakfast would be a great Mothers Day treat.  It wasn't.  The food was average, it was very expensive, and the service was ordinary.  I would come again to stay, but would not use the restaurant.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, average restaurant",
We only had a 3 day visit but that was long enough to know we'll be back. From check in to check out just wonderful staff. We had access to the Executive Lounge as part of our package and it was delightful. Made even more enjoyable by the dedicated staff member 'Hazel' what a joy each day in the Executive lounge. Hazel made everyone feel special. We cannot recommend the JW Marriot more highly and are already planning our next visit...thank you.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Hotel,
"Stayed for a night. Really nice big room with big bathroom and comfy beds. The decor is not to my taste but that's negligible. If you can, get an upgrade to club access so that you can access the exec lounge which has great coffee. There is a wide variety on offer for breakfast but the pancakes are really recommended.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Spacious Room & Comfy Bed,
"Having stayed 10 times over the last year, I can say that the team at JW Marriott make you feel at home.  The service is exceptional, the people friendly and the hotel oozes style.  The rooms aren't huge but give you everything that I need.  Could not consider going anywhere else.  Shout out to my man - Saathiis Mohan. He would jump in front of ongoing traffic to get you a ride and it lots of fun!  See you next week!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Saathiis Mohan is the Boss!,
"this hotel was wonderful. central location, infinity pool with incredible city views, attention to detail in rooms. friendly helpful staff - always attentive and ready to help with anything.we had access to the executive lounge with our deal - buffet breakfast, afternoon tea , hors doeuvres, and open bar for 4 hrs in evening.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,fantastic,
"The rooms are old and grotty looking ,they only give you one bottom sheet no top just a doona which if that is too warm you have nothing to put over you I like to sleep covered with the aircon blowing it is too cold for nothing but the doona made it too warm , the shower was not set up properly and the water ran back towards the basin area so you needed a towel to stop it  The cleaning service was really slack didn't vacumme all the time we were here (5 days) not sure when it was done but was food crumbs on the floor when we arrived still there when we left The desk staff and wait staff in the lounge we very good  bed were comfy  but very noisy for a 5th floor you could hear the cars and people all night",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Not what i expected,
"Booked a suite room for my birthday celebration, room was clean and quiet, request for a late check out and our check out was extended until 4pm, impressive service. Executive lounge service was excellent. But it will be even better if the hotel were to send over a small piece of complimentary birthday cake which we got it in Conrad Centennial SG. Will come again and highly recommend.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel,
"Had a three day stay in the Marriott and it's location is walking distance to the underground rail network which is easy to navigate and use. The facilities within the Marriott were great and a the rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. The restaurant was clean with the most friendly staff. The whole hotel is filled with friendly staff who are more than willing to assist you with anything or question you have.  Staff member Hazel was a lovely polite person who assisted you constantly and was friendly. She excelled with her assistance and knowledge of Singapore. She helped with a hot lemon cold remedy which eased my suffering wife's cold. She is a credit to The JW Marriott South Beach. Thanks for the stay and the great memories of Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great Location, Great Hotel, Fantastic Staff",
Had a short stay in May and was wowed. The hotel is very new and so benefits from all sorts of modern touches. I was upgraded to a suite on the 13th floor (pictured); the room was amazing. The gym (pictured) is on the 18th floor with what is essentially a rooftop pool and activity room for kids.   The hotel itself is located in a new development right across the street from the historic Raffles Hotel (which is undergoing restoration). There are plenty of nice shops and restaurants nearby; the Orchard Road high street area is about a 10-15 minute taxi ride away.  Lounge is nice and large and the breakfast served there is of good quality. All staff is friendly and willing to help. I would not hesitate to book a room here during my next visit to Singapore.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel for business or pleasure!,
"We enjoyed a 5 night stay recently. The stay was perfect from check-in in to check-out. Upon arrival our room was not yet ready, as we arrived very early in the morning, but the friendly and helpful staff offered us to take a shower in the facilities and freshen up. We were upgraded to a suite at a very reasonable price, as this room was available earlier. The suite offered a stunning view of Singapore and was overall amazing. Very nice breakfast in the Exec Lounge, hats-off to the omelette-chef!  The hotel is located close to Esplanade Metro Station, so getting around is easy, but you could even walk to the CBD in 15mins.   Long story short: Book it!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfect!,
"Had a wonderful stay at this hotel in Singapore.  Outstanding customer service!  Executive Lounge was phenomenal.  Well appointed but small rooms.  Great location! View from the top floor is breathtaking!   Staff was one of  the best I've encountered in my 34 years of staying at Marriotts....in particular Melvin, Hazel, Chef Song, and Chef Chen.  Loved every minute of my stay!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,FABULOUS HOTEL!,
"Check in time is 4pm and cannot be earlier as it depend if there's room available. Check up at 12pm and the max time for late check up is 2pm. Seems to have shortchange in the duration of stay. Usual check in time is 3pm. Expectation is high as this is the first time doing staycation in Singapore. As compare to other marriott hotel, service was not what I expect. Hotel seems new but some of the things have already worn off or stained. Given a room with no view except for the roof top dampened my mood for the whole staycation. Bath salt provided, shampoo and shower gel from aromatherapy brand. See how it goes for my 2nd day.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Staycation,
As Singapore was chosen as central location for our project our group were 10 pax. Again check-in check-out not really well managed and understand it is difficult but when only 1 person is at check-in I wonder. Very nice bed n great pillows - but value for money is out of proportion.  The executive lounge is very well placdd and if Haz is there the sun shines! Lovely smile and beautiful lipstick! Great asset!! Food is excellent,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Value for money?,
"JW Marriott at Singapore is strategically located at heart of economic district and close to tourists attractions. All at walkable distance. Airport is just 30 mins away. Singapore giant wheel, river quay, Merlin garden are close-by.  It is just outside the south beach MRT station.  Rooms are spacious with very good interiors. ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Located at business district. ,
"We were greeted with a huge psychedelic mural as we stepped in the door - and that was just the beginning, The Tonic bar had the craziest chandeliers I think I've ever seen, the lifts had line drawings of fish on the walls that changed as the interior lights changed colour and our rooms were full of mirrors - too full, but I guess at least it was different.  The basics of the hotel were not quite so good, a little dirty on the walls behind check-in, reasonable but a little basic in the executive lounge - but still quirky. Well situated, just in front of the old Raffles, but I wouldn't rush back",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Quirky and different,
A beautiful hotel with great service.  I am a particular fan of the artwork spread throughout the the premises.  The hotel had awesome service from the moment that we arrived.  A special note about all of employees in the executive lounge.  Jaquelyn the lounge manager is very welcoming and Hazel made us feel at home.  My daughter is ready to move in.  The location is also terrific with underground passage to three different malls with terrific stores and local restaurants.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Above and beyond!,
"I'm actually a child writing this review. I love the hotel! On 16/4/18 midnight, I got off the business class plane from Perth. We booked a day before so that we don't have to wait for a few hours just to get in. For some reason me and my mum's room got upgraded to premium! I decided to unpack and do some random stuff. In the afternoon, we found out there was a pool on level 18. So I got my hotel card, got up the elevator and into the cold pool. It was really cold until you got the hang of it. Then the next few days, I ate food at the buffet for lunch. Delicious food! It is the 5th day of my 7 days of Singapore, planning to go to Universal Studios. I don't want to leave but I do miss my friends!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic!!,
"This was our second visit and found the staff very friendly and helpful especially Hazel and chef Dhama both who deserve special thanks, One note originally the exec lounge had champagne and bath toiletries were Joe Malone sadly these are now both replaced by much cheaper options, but all in all a good visit.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Good well located hotel,
Was invited to a breakfast meeting with a top end client was pleasantly suprised at the vast array from fresh juice egg types and variety of bread from the bakery . Seating tend to be modern so not very comfortable,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Breakfast at the  lounge,
"My wife and I stayed at the JW in February 2018. I am an experienced global business traveller and its not often I take the time to write a review, but this time I feel compelled. Just to thank the staff for making our stay an excellent experience. From the moment we arrived to the time we left the service was excellent and faultless. The room was to the usual high JW standard. Special thanks goes to the executive lounge team (Yoges, Sarah and Marvin) for their hospitality, for arranging an excellant table for my wife's birthday and even providing a cake. Keep it up!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Singapore Trip - Feb 2018_Bhandal,
"We are on a long trip to celebrate our 40th anniversary,  and were to transfer airlines in Singapore.  We decided to make a weekend of it, and were really glad we did. My wife has been a Marriott Platinum Elite member for many years, so she knows her Marriotts well. She agrees that this hotel excels at everything, just like Singapore does. We especially appreciated how the executive lounge hosts rolled out the red carpet. We had a 2:00 am flight to make. With a late check out, we still were travellers with hours to kill. Atiqah made sure we enjoyed a stress free evening,  and we will get on our plane for an 18 hour flight well rested. Kudos to everyone at JW Marriott South Beach.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Wonderful 2 night layover in Singapore,
"We had the executive lounge benefits and it was one of the best I have ever come across. it is open all day and you there is 4 hours from 5.30 - 9.30pm which is just free flowing alcohol and you serve yourself which is good. Food is from 5.30 - 7.30 and the variety is really good. Location of the hotel is perfect, so close to shopping - Raffles City and Suntec is just across the road. Pools were great however my only gripe would be that the phone on level 18 should be heated. it has an amazing view and hardly used because of the pool temperature which is such a shame. other than that, I could not fault the hotel. Staff are extremely friendly. The Tonic bar is amazing and the staff are very knowledgeable.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic location and hotel,
"I don't normally write reviews but here's one. Stayed at the hotel as a staycation for my birthday. We did enjoy our stay and the facilities, although we did not have time to enjoy the spa. We wished we could extend for another night there. When you come in the lobby, u see the gummy sweets (yum). The staff were so friendly. A friend was having a bad cough and was offered water while waiting for me at the lobby. Our room was the beautiful marina view. Rooms are new -not exactly big but nice layout. Although the room did not have the warm cozy feeling, but we liked it. Had trouble opening the heavy bathroom doors though. The swimming pools were nice, but cold. We had access to the lounge during our stay. The staff were all attentive, especially Hazel and Kaiwen.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Had a great stay,
"Hotel is great. Staff are all polite, helpful and very knowledgable about the local area. Gym is massive and fully kitted out. Location is central and some restaurants near. Huge variety for Hotel breakfast. Hotel main menu needs more vegetarian options. 2 lovely pools with stunning views esp the infinity pool. Top floor pool is not used as much so better for a swim. Rooms are small so limited space for luggage but bed is so comfy and bathroom is big. Especially big praise for the incredibly  hardworking breakfast staff who always smile and are probably not appreciated enough. No complaints, would stay again. Thank you JW Marriott. ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Highly recommend ,
Stayed here for a long weekend with executive lounge access . Well worth the extra cost . The hotel is well positioned to explore Singapore and close to alm th attractions. Nice room and has all you need for the stay  The staff are attentive and nothing is too much trouble. The breakfasts and club lounge exceeded expectations. On our list of to do again !,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Modern Funky Hotel,
"Stayed for 4 nights.  Room was small. Bathroom had a sliding mirror to allow watching TV while in Bath.  Nice thought but super impractical as one can hear every sound in the bathroom when used by another. Room had fleas flying around.  Staff were rude...  Told my colleague of mine to ""move aside"" in the lift. When reported I didn't get any feedback on the incident.  No pillow menu.  Can't believe bed was not a pocketed spring mattress and if it was a rather lousy one.  Have stayed in Marriot around the world and this is the first that I have found to be so lousy. The check in was messy as there wasn't a queue system.  Seriously needs improvement.  ",2.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Deluxe room had fleas! ,
"We stayed at JW Marriott Hotel South Beach for 10 days. Overall, we had a pleasurable experience. First, the hotel is new. Second, there is a great variety of food for breakfast at Beach Kitchen. Third, the hotel location is perfect, as it is very convenient and easy for people to visit us.  Service at the executive lounge is great. Ann, the manager, did a fabulous job in leading a team of friendly and hardworking staff who served us so well. We love the bright smile of Lavinda, Hazel, and Vivien. The afternoon tea is nice too. Strongly recommend visitors to get access to the lounge.  We certainly look forward to staying at this hotel in our next visit to Singapore.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great service at the executive lounge,

I have not stayed here before but will in the he future each time I visit.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Not a great start with forgotten airport pickup but they really made up for it!!!,
I stayed one night with my wife and 18mth old daughter. There are no kids facilities but have great 2 pools. They are not really for swimming but place for relax. (Nearby shopping malls have many kids cafe)  Interior is very modern and trendy. And it's only opened in early 2017. Staffs are very genuinely nice. Especially ones in club lounge were very friendly and helpful. I was very impressed. Food there is not exciting though.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Trendy and modern hotel w excellent service,
"Not your traditional Marriott.   Just over a year old, this property has gone for the very contemporary feel.  Rooms are very techy  Bathrooms with toilet seats that automatically go up and down when you enter.  Turning lights on and off can be a challenge.  Executive Lounge is excellent in true Asian style.  Great location, covered access to train station.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Not your grandfather's Marriott,

"The views from the Hotel were simply amazing.  Rooms were modern, quiet and the bathroom was luxurious.  The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, especially in the Executive lounge.  When we walked into the lounge, the staff would greet us by name and they were very attentive, making sure that we had everything we wanted.  A special call out to one of the servers, Hazel!! who was so friendly, cheerful, and just a great person!  She is a keeper JW!  Can not thank her enough for making our stay so memorable.  The only disappointment at the hotel was that the water in the pool (outside) was very chilly (who would think in Singapore?) so much so that we did not want to go in.  The hotel is also very central to many of the sites, within walking distance.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,WOW on Customer Service!,
"Beautiful room but for 350 sgd a night I think expecting a king bed vs 2 twins is reasonable.  Lots of North Americans here for business who expect king beds.  Did the hotel run out of money when it  came time to select beds? Even doubles or queens would be better.  Also no plugs in  bath room, so strange.  Lobby is a bit of a zoo for checking out, better to do on line.   Would also have appreciated a coffee maker in room.  Breakfast is excellent, possibly best buffet in Singapore.  Pool also beautiful.   Will not be back for work unless someone can guarantee me a king bed when I reserve. ",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Twin beds made sleeping difficult,
"Thx to Managing Director Stephane and his wonderful Marriott South Beach team for a great family holiday. We were spoilt by the staff in the Executive Lounge and housekeeping..nothing was too much trouble..special thx to Hazel, Kelvin and Ann Margaret for their welcoming smiles and great service to our family...also breakfast won't be the same without Kens perfect omelettes.  We ticked everything off the Trip advisor 7 day itinerary except the Singapore Flyer (closed)...maybe next visit.

The hotel is very nice and all the staff are wonderful but I have to give a big shout out to Ann and Yogesh (not sure I spelled that right) who work in the Executive Lounge! Not only did they great us but remembered us and made sure we had everything we needed. Great suggestions for local places to visit too! I am a tequila drinker and on the 2nd night they ran out.. They went out of their way to find me a bottle and then tuck it away so I had my favorite drink for the rest of my stay! Stellar service that went above and beyond!,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic Executive Lounge Staff,
"Stayed at the JW Marriott during a recent business trip through the region.  Hotel staff were exceptional (thank you Eva), in taking care of my requests.

I speacially asked for quite room cause I had a long flight the next day. Rueben, with sincere service mind at the front desk, helped us to have very comfortable stay! Thank you!!! The rooftop pool had a nice view but the water was too cold. Would have been much better if they warmed pool water a bit.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,special thanks to Rueben at the front desk!,
"From the moment we checked in, there was literally no turning back. Everything was just amazing. Even having the complimentary drink at the Tonic Bar was such a pleasant experience, soothing all the 5 senses. We enjoyed our time hanging out at the hotel so much we ordered room service although we had made dinner reservations at restaurant across the street. In-room dining has never been known to be delicious, but the JW Marriot surprised us with the delicious food and well plated food. The Fish & Chips was a stand out (we ate at the roof top bar on the 18th floor - it is a MUST GO!)",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,A Hotel that exceeds your expecations,
"The rooms at JW Marriott are excellent and luxurious. The room was stylish and had extra additions of fluffy pink robes, slippers with bunnies on them, facial steamer and pedicure kits - The rooms were plush with great attention to detail and amenities - such as a very clever toilet and remote-control bidet, electric shades and curtains, wonderful tub. The included laundry was also much appreciated. All in all, a stylish stayacation in a top notch location ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Amazing rooms and space, good staycation :)",
"This hotel is a combination of modern and historic. We had a club deluxe room with a king bed which was much smaller than the posted images on their web page. We moved the chair away from the desk so that we could easily gain access to both sides of the bed. Once we were settled we enjoyed this hotel and it's upscale elegance. A special thanks to Mazelan at the Concierge Desk who made travel arrangements on our behalf and Lavinda who was very friendly and efficient. It is very close to all the attractions Marina Bay, Clarke Quay etc",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Location,
The hotel has everything you would want from a hotel.  The front desk was very accommodating.  The conceige was great especially Muzaffer Azrin Bin Jamil.  Helped with everything and gave us great suggestions.  The wait staff in the Beach Road kitchen was wonderful including the Executive Sous Chef Pinkie Ray.  The rooms were very modern and clean with great views.  The pool and workout rooms were excellent. There are no words to describe the hospitality and friendlyness of everyone at this hotel.  This is the place to stay in Singapore.,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel,
"Staying at this hotel was one of the best experience I had. The hotel staff is extremely professional, courteous, and efficient.

I especially would like to highlight one of the staff member Hafiq for his extreme professionalism and just for making our stay a memorable one from every stand point.  Thank you and we can not wait to come back!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing experience,
"This hotel was okay -  1) The hotel was very busy on arrival and although we were checked in relatively quickly, there felt like a lot of commotion in the lobby. 2) Our room didn't have a view at all, and faced an air-conditioning unit and exterior rock garden (open air area, on the same level of hotel as our room) 3) Room had a baby crib in it for no apparent reason when we arrived, it wasn't picked up for over an hour after we called about it (again, they're busy but this is a JW) 4) Rooms are very small (even for Singapore)  Otherwise, the location is central and the pool looking South near the rooftop looked quite cool although we didn't use it.  Not horrible but could be better.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Nice Hotel, Kind of Busy, Centrally Located",
"Stayed on a recent business trip to Singapore, our team are in Singapore 3-4 times a year and this is the first time we have tried the Marriott at south beach and we were very impressed  Really helpful staff and a really high standard of care, always friendly. The executive lounge on level 2 is really great for breakfast and also an early afternoon  bite to eat before any additional appointments we had, the staff here were great and made an effort remembering our names after the first day   Rooms were really modern and facilities in the hotel also great   Definitely will be our hotel of choice when returning in May ",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel and location ,
"Such a Great Hotel, Fabulous location right in the centre of town with easy access to the MRT,  staff were very helpful and nothing to much for them.

Would highly recommend this Hotel!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Singapore Feb 2018,
"Had a night stay at the deluxe room last weekend and I love how new everything is. Bathtub was huge!   Was late for breakfast the next morning and only arrived 10 mins before it ended.

Also, one of the receptionists Charmaine was very professional and her service is absolutely top notch. Will be back :)",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great hotel w wonderful service 👍🏻,
The hotel is beautiful and oozing of Phillipe Stark's design. The rooms are a bit small but very well organised. The bathrooms are amazing despite only having one basin. Loved the self cleaning and drying heated loo seats. I want one!  The two pools are nice but have no place to lie out in the sun. What a shame to spend so much on rooftop pools but have no sun loungers. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Loved this place ,
"Relatively new hi-tech, luxury hotel, where we found the location, service and staff to be excellent.  Wide choice of bars and restaurants at the hotel, and the dinner buffet at its South Beach Kitchen restaurant was outstanding.  Whilst expensive, it is very good value. The buffet breakfast at this restaurant is extremely good too and we had numerous examples of good service from the welcoming and very accommodating staff and chefs. The views of Singapore from the pool area on the 18th floor are breath-taking. The hotel is a very short walk from the starting point for Singapore tours by open-top buses and the ""Duck"" tours.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,5 Night Stay in January,
"The Hotel is relatively new and therefore very modern and rooms pretty hi tech. However, I found the service and attitude of staff and management little cold and less flexible. I am a member of Marriott reward program with over 65,000 points but neither I could use them to upgrade my room nor I was allowed access to lounge facilities. I believe, the hotel should be all about service, attitude and quality...and this one falls short on 2 of the 3 main ingredients. Will think twice  before booking here again or recommending to someone else.....",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Expensive hotel with little flexibility,
Hotel is up there with very good JW Marriotts around the world.  Interesting layout with the reception and restaurants being being in different buildings.  (Making the hotel reception too small - narrow - for the hotel).  Rooms very nice - bit blingy with loads of mirrors - but quite small.  Good bathrooms.  Comfortable beds.  Very smooth and fast lifts.  Swimming pool has great view but a bit cold and nowhere to relax around it really.  Very well equipped gym.  Breakfast was a bit of a bun-fight.  Way too many people for the restaurant to cope but the food itself was very good with wide selection.  Hotel is very well situated close to Suntec City and SMRT.  Staff were very good - even wishing my Happy Birthday!,4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Different take on hotel,

"Everything just perfect and lovely (wonderful, magnificent, splendid, superb, brilliant, excellent, etc.):  - hospitality - service - food  - warmth of the hotel staff - location of the hotel - rooms (we had a spectacular view from our bedroom and even from the bathroom to Marina Bay and the skyline) - Marriott Rewards Membership guest service) - infinity pool  We would like to express our sincere thanks to Hazel and Sarah Soriano for their candid hospitality.  Agata & Ralf",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Perfectly happy! Great hospitality and excellent quality,
"Just stayed at the JW for a trip with my girlfriend! It had a great view of Singapore! We are gold Marriott members and had access to the executive lounge. We had breakfast, appetizers and drinks on a daily basis. It def made our trip! Special shout to all the staff in the executive lounge as well as Vaibhav who made the breakfast experience more memorable. He was very attentive and friendly! Thank you!!  The only negative of the hotel is the pool area. While the the views from the pool are amazing, not being able to drink in the pool, no chair or tables to put your belongings by the pool, as well as the frigid cold water in the pool made the pool experience sub par.  Still overall it's a great hotel!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Gem!,
"Spew spent 6nights with this great hotel. Staff are truly wonderful and helpful.  We are platinum with Marriott and the concierge lounge is wonderful -breakfast is fantastic +0-thank you.

"I walked into the hotel in search for a coffee shop, and to also explore since the building is architecturally interesting.  Amamda, the hotel staff, approached me kindly to offer any help she can.  She not only showed me to the coffee shops, but also offered me wifi access, and suggested that she store my luggage (because I was walking around with my handful).  Really touched by her sincere hospitality.  Definitely wanting to come with family for my next stay in Singapore!  The hotel complex is also really cool and groovy too, with hip bars and restaurants.",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Amazing hospitality!,

"Spent a night at JW Marriott South Beach to experience this new hotel. The hotel is easily accessible via Esplanade  MRT and strategically located near marina shopping Malls, Suntec and raffles shopping centre. Was complimentary upgraded to the duluxe suite as a Platinum Elite member. Checkin was smooth and the suite is trendy, comfy and clean. Unlike the usual club lounge in Marriott chain, the concept for JW Marriott South Beach is colourful and trendy. Afternoon tea, evening cocktail and buffet were ok but would be better if the choice of food is more. Friendly and professional staff and always greet you with a smile Great hotel for family staycation!  Dr E Chow",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Great Staycation Expeience,

The concierge desk had amazing knowledgeable people.  Thank you Marriott!!!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Loved it!!!,
"Stayed in JW Marriott around the world and a couple of times with JW Marriott South Beach. Very different from the classy JW Marriott that you would find. JE Marriott South Beach has a more fun, club-like feel to it probably because it took over and operate from the boutique hotel. Being a platinum elite member, perks and upgrades is really nothing to shout about compared to what One would be getting from other Marriotts. Location wise is fantastic though with the MRT and malls within minutes of walk.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fun Marriott ,
This is such a beautiful hotel with such stylish decor and design. From the entrance to the modern artwork that is so mesmerising and all the amazing features this hotel will not disappoint. A comfortable room with everything that is needed for a wonderful stay. All the hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful. This hotel is in a very handy location - close to the MRT and shopping malls. Highly recommended it. ,5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Luxury stay,
"What a superb hotel! All staff in business access centre club are fantastic,going above and beyond expectation. Hazel, Rio and Henny always happy to help, very friendly and providing excellent customer service.

Will definitely return and highly recommend to all, a true gem in Singapore!",5.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fantastic 5 star,
"One week before I was traveling to Singapore, and stayed at this hotel. Very good location, close to Marina Bay, Orchard street , Sentosa. Many restaurant around.  Service was great !  Room small but nice, big bathroom.  But only one moment : one day I ordered room service and serving table was dirty((((.   ",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Good service, good location ",
"We only stayed here one night  but the hotel was modern and clean, the staff friendly and helpful.  Great location is you want to be near Marina Bay .Although we agree the lobby is unremarkable, the Executive lounge was one of the best that we've been in. Gym was entirely adequate and all the equipment was functional.  No complaints, would definitely stay again",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Nice place to stay,
"We were told there's a birthday complimentary cake being sent to our room, however, we still need to call to remind them.   There were enough toiletries and bottled drinks for the guests. The room service and in-Room dining are good.  The club lounge afternoon tea food supply wasn't fantastic. The Receptionists were friendly, however, they were not attentive to the locals.   We're told to do it ourself at the noodles counter during breakfast hours, however, the Chef is more accommodative to tourist requests.   The substandard services are pretty obvious but we're paying the same fee as the tourists!   ",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Average service ,
"We had a faultless (near enough) stay at the Valley Wing. We like the Shangri La brand and this is one of their jewels in the crown. First class service throughout which really makes the place. Everything in the valley wing is handled with gracious efficiency and courtesy. Despite the elegant surroundings, children are made to feel welcome. We can't wait to return. Wish we could thank everyone in the Valley wing, but special mention to Valley wing Director Aris, Amin and Peggy and the conductor of orchestra John Rice!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Faultless,
"Just spent a few days for a weekend hide-away. I am a Marriot Bonvoy elite and I am not even in Shangri la circle, so my expectation was not high when I checked in. To my surprise, I was impressed by the nice deluxe room, great hospitality and service received. They even delivered a birthday cake with a warming card to go with it, reaching me finally through multiple efforts. Thanks Yana! Try the table by the pool. With wine and great food from the Italian restaurant, everything is just perfect! Will definitely be back once in a while.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Nice hotel for weekend hide-away,
"Just a lovely hotel. Staff try hard to deliver great service. Facilities are top notch. Had to work a bit at check in to get an upgrade on the Amex FHR booked room (Shangri-La is always stingy with upgrades but generous on check in/out times). Of course a bit of a walk to Orchard Rd but knew that when choosing the hotel. Breakfast in The Line busy as always but possible to reserve a time slot. Good stay, will return.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Still good,
"I came here with my partner and we absolutely loved the hotel. Despite hassles related to COVID-19, we felt at home. This is a testament to the great service.   Unfortunately we left abruptly because of a family emergency. Although we were stressed and impolite due to our sudden and rushed departure, the staff never ceased to provide a professional and courteous service.   We want to apologise for any rudeness and thank the ShangriLa for making our stay in Singapore an amazing one. A further thanks for sorting our taxi to the airport as well. It was much appreciated during such a stressful time.  Due to the service and high standards, I will only stay at the ShangriLa when visiting again.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Amazing hotel and professional service,
"I stayed at the Shangri-La Singapore various times during business trips to Singapore and usually experienced a great service. However, after my last stay the hotel did not release my security deposit without any explanation.   It's been three months and the security deposit was still not released. From the front office there is no explanation, simply that they instructed their merchant bank to do so and ""it should be released in a few weeks"".  Not sure if it's a blatant scam or just incompetence. In any case, I paid twice for a week's stay and only get standard emails from their front office staff. Be mindful when providing them with your credit card details.",1.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Disappointed - Scammed of my security deposit,
Found used towels in room. Been given expired amenities. Lack of turndown service. Lack of consistency across all the staff. Been told different answers by different staff members regarding breakfast arrangements. Breakfast table cleared and ready for the next guest while I was up grabbing more food - Is this discrimination against solo travellers? Also found out that GC Dimond status means nothing here as they clearly do not value you.,1.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Disorganised Hotel,
"We stayed in the garden wing for 5 nights. The location was slightly removed from the CBD however its proximity to Orchid Rd and the Botanic Gardens well made up for it. Make sure to book for the restaurants far in advance- we tried to get bookings during our stay and there were none available at reasonable times. The rooms were good with plenty of amenities, an excellent buffet with enough choices for you to eat there every day and always find something new! The property was beautiful and service was up to high standards.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellent stay in Garden Wing,
"Fantastic staycation experience. All the staff were very courteous and helpful. When I requested for chocolate cookie, one of the chef went all the way out to find chocolate cookie for my kids.

We had a horrible experience. We booked 6 rooms and theh delayed our check in. They said they would give more importnace to locals than non locals  and ended up giving our rooms at 5pm.

"We had 2 days business events at the Shangri-La and Emma Mahdiyah from banquet team was assigned to take care of our function room. From the moment I met her, she saw I was carrying multiple bags and luggages, she offered to help me and walked me to the meeting room. Throughout the entire 2 days, she took care of our guests seamlessly, no matter how urgent the requests, she stayed calm and assisted me like a breeze.

"Greeted by warm staff everywhere. When we checked in at 12pm, most of the slots for Buds and Splash zone were already fully booked. Even breakfast slots! We were shocked initially as we thought check in time was 3pm. We were then advised by the staff to approach Buds counter to check for availabilty of slots as the online form might not be updated. After visiting the Buds counter, the friendly staff there managed to slot us in to our preferred timings. Rooms and toilet were impeccable. Splash zone area was very clean and fun for the kids. Pirate ship area was so pretty! Buds play area was also very well kept and enjoyable for kids! Well our money's worth, 5 star hotel experience indeed.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Great for kids, warm and hospitable staff! Many thumbs up for sure :)",
"I made a reservation for breakfast through the hotel website so was shocked to be told on arrival that the restaurant was only open to hotel residents.

"Pros (1) Splash the outdoor water playground was fun with plenty for kids to do (2) Buds the indoor playground was fun too with an art room (3) The steak and Italian restaurants were good (4) Room was big with a huge bathroom.  Cons (1) Super crowded and hotel could not cope sometimes  (2) 1 hour wait for food at first breakfast. Kitchen was overwhelmed and all the guests had to wait a long time for their food. (3) Check in was chaotic. I was told to sit at a table and be called when it was my turn but that did not happen. Other people were allowed to cut queue. (4) Check in counter staff could not help to book activities. Therefore, check in took long as time had to be spent on my phone booking each activity. (5) Room was a bit dated. Would have been great in the 1990s.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Like being on a crowded cruise ship,

Breakfast is good, high tea and canapes were good as well. I love how the lobby lounge and the summit room was so nice for us to have light bites and refreshing drinks.  I noticed there were a slight stain on my bath robes but other than that it was a very pleasant stay, clean rooms and amazing turn down service.  Although I think the hotel is more friendly to family with kids, but my husband and I still have plenty of space for privacy as the hotel area is very big with  scenery walk.

From the breakfast to the canapes to the after-hours drink sessions, each and every personnel deserves a huge kudo.  Despite the high turnover of guests, we observed that every table was served with promptness and attentiveness, which was unusually heart-warming given the festive season.  In particular, Eillen and Raja made special efforts for guests (adults and kids alike!) to feel at home.  We will certainly be paying more visits to this lovely premise for that extra personal touch.

When we were at the cashier she told us that the total amount was $40+. We told her we would like to get a just one more  item to add. She gave an annoyed look, threw our receipt in the paper bag and turned to the next customer. We were shocked by such rude attitude.

Buds and Splash were heaven for the kids. There were also activities such as treasure hunt which the kids get to explore around the hotel. We had in room dining for the 1st 2 days. Breakfast came in a very generous portion and dinner was great. Only some hipcups with the dinner ordering which took a while to get through but this did not dampen our spirits.

"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Good experience,

"Had a 3D2N stay at the hotel with my wife and 1-year old kid.   Room was spacious and clean. Although im doubting if there should be 2 tables in the room. 1 coffee table just by the sofa and another dining table(i assume) just in front of it. The bed however was a totally different story. It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better.   The hotel is indeed family friendly with loads of facilities catered to kids like buds, splash zone and even a section of the swimming pool catering to kids. Check in and check out were a breeze.   Had the sleep been better, it would have been a wonderful staycation enjoyed by the whole family.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Enjoyable with room for improvements,

Though the hotel is in the city, inside of the property is a totally different feel. Lots of green and pool is huge...just like an oasis in the city.

Hotel was nice to give a free upgrade. I appreciated that.   As the indoor and outdoor playground required booking, this was not communicated to the guests.   While i was waiting at the lobby, i could have made all the bookings. By the time i tried to make the bookings at 4 plus pm, all slots were booked in both e outdoor and indoor playground for both days.   And bookings can only be made upon check-in.   Thus, my kids were extremely disappointed.   So note to parents: book early asap upon check in.   ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,More information should be given,
"Pros The staff were so organized yet polite, they safety protocols that they have in place were all so systematic and relevant. The room was well- equipped with all the basic necessities and the stay was a pleasure.

There are no Tamil channels on the TV  in a time where cable TV is so affordable and essential",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great place for a staycation,

Also Doris from Spa, sales staff Dekura and Travel Reservation Team of Murni, Wei Qian and Poh Gek. They were friendly, helpful and served with passion and smiles.

We stayed in a Horizon Club deluxe room - was modern and comfortable with an excellent view. The hotel is ideally situated and great for those who enjoy a walk.  The newly updated HC was well refurbished but large and overcrowded with people and screaming children. It felt like we were in an airport lounge and we fighting for a table. The food and beverages were average at best; some of the red wine not even drinkable. The staff are friendly and efficient but sadly when the space is at full capacity at most times of the day - it doesn't really matter.,3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great room but there are better hotels in Singapore,

"Having first visited Hong Kong and Vietnam, my wife and I finished our holiday with 4 days in Singapore. Our agents, Travel Bag (Alton), recommended we stayed at the Shangri -La Hotel, but in their up-market and more exclusive Valley Wing. This was an inspirational choice! The quality of the rooms, the service, the facilities and of course the amazing staff, made it a totally memorable stay.  The staff were totally discreet and yet always helpful. Nothing was too much for them to advise, arrange, or help with. The rooms were immaculate, as were their enclosed gardens!

The hotel is in a beautiful neighborhood and you can walk to a lot of places from the hotel. I walked to shopping and the botanical gardens. The lobby area is really beautiful. My bed was so comfortable, bathroom was nice and I had plenty of storage in the room. The only negative about the hotel is that the pool was full of screaming children and service at the pool was pretty non-existent. I had to flag someone down to order a drink and something to eat.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Perfect Stay,
It has been a while - we came back for a staycation. It was a bit disappointed to find that the service level was dropped.

The hotel facilities and staff are great. But doing a block booking for a seminar for overseas visitors was not as smooth as I had expected. I had chosen Shangri La based on my past great experience staying there and was disappointed with the standard of the booking system that I had to intervened on behalf of my overseas guests. I had envisioned that once the special booking code was allocated all my guests would be able to do their own bookings. Unfortunately there were hiccups along the way and I was embarrassed after having informing them this is one of Singapore's best.Luckily once everyone arrived the seminar proceeded well.,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Hotel is great, but block booking sucks.",

This appearance of this hotel was grand. However the services from check in and ALL the restaurants were AWFUL! We would get our main course before the appetizers. Our kids food would come out last.

The rooms are large and the pool and fitness centre are excellent. The nightly buffet at the Line restaurant,has so much choice and is a taste experience. The Italian waterfall restaurant was very good.There is very little not to like about this tremendous hotel.look forward to a return visit",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Stunning hotel,
"Been to The Line many times last year and just came back for family gathering. The spread was still remain great as before with lots of options including oysters, wagyu and new station, Thai cuisine. Staffs were very friendly from welcoming to farewell. The restaurant manager, Stiefen visited our table and ensure if we all have happy tummy. He also helped us to take a group photo and personally brought us some Indian dishes fresh from the kitchen to our table.  Overall, we will certainly come back for another occasions!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Best Feast in Town @ The LINE!,
"I recently stayed at the Shangri-La in Singapore and I can definitely say i'll be back! I am so glad I booked the Horizon club. This means you can skip the queue down stairs and head up to the 24th floor to check in. The 24th floor is the Horizon club whereby you can enjoy your breakfast in piece and quiet in the morning as well as have afternoon tea between 2pm and 4pm and the all your alcohol included between 5pm and 8pm. The hotel also has an amazing fully equipped gym with steam room, sauna and plunge pool and the main swimming pool is huge. This is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,One Of The Best I Have Stayed In,
"On our trips to Singapore to see family, we usually go for a 'brunch' at one of the big hotels.  They are expensive but very comprehensive usually.  This time we decided to try the buffet lunch at the Shangri-La near Stevens which was a third of the price. It was an excellent occasion in a lovely, open and spacious Rose Balcony restaurant. There was a wide variety of different dishes to choose from and beautiful desserts. Altogether a memorable relaxed family occasion and very good value",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Try the buffet lunch, amazing value",
"We stayed there overnight in the Garden Wing rooms on two occasions in September. The rooms were large and very nice, if a little dated, but very comfortable and well appointed nonetheless. They have usable balconies overlooking the pool and gardens. The pool area is very nice. Lots of lounges and enough with shade. We had dinner at the Italian Restaurant which was also very good. Service at check in / out and poolside was friendly and very helpful - special thanks to Itz.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great Stay,
"Once again the Shangri La lived up to and beyond expectations for service, friendliness, efficiency and amenities.  The only slight disappointment was to find that the Water Grill no longer served breakfast or coffee in the mornings for those of us in the garden wing or at all. However the hotel generally continues to delight and I hope to return another day.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Wonderful stay,
"We have tried all the luxury hotels in Singapore. We have found Shangri-La to be the most helpful, most selection and clearly signed for vegan/vegetarian/lacto- vegetarian diets. Indran at the Gym was very helpful by clearly showing where the facilities are. This made  the experience non-threatening as it can be at some gyms.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Vegaterian/Vegan/Gym,
"We had an amazing time at a staycation for our little family. Asian hospitality is unparalleled but Singapore often lags behind in this area - Shangri-La proved it otherwise. It is one of the most child friendly hotels I've ever stayed at, without compromising on luxury. The hotel staff were extremely accommodating (I was a strict detox and they went out of their way to cater to my idiosyncrasies).  Excellent food options (without breaking the bank), leafy but central neighbourhood, a ton of activities for children and beautiful newly renovated rooms - we will definitely go back!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Luxury for the entire family,
After the hustle and bustle of the F1 GP it was an absolute pleasure to spend 4 days on some serious R and R. I cannot think of a better place too stay. Everything is done so well that I never have reason to make extra requests. I fact there is no reason to leave the sanctuary of the hotel. I do however like the Penang Shangri-La because they have an Adults only area pool for one wing of the hotel. Perhaps club rooms and suites should have inclusive soft drinks at the pool. Negating the need to go to the club lounge. Would be a great addition to the club room. ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Super,
"Two of us having the local kueh (small cakes & snack) for less than S$30 per head. Service is attentive and polite, food are well prepared & presented. Ambience is relax, clam & elegant. The only the local tea is way too sweet. Even after adding water, it is hardly drinkable. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Afternoon tea @ lobby is fantastic ,
"We stayed for 5 nights here and the whole experience was wonderful. I emailed in advance to let them know the trip was for my mum's 60th birthday and they really went above and beyond to make her feel special. We got upgraded from the Tower Wing to Valley Wing and they had a birthday cake ready in the room, which was a lovely gesture. Mica accompanied us to the room to make sure everything was perfect and even gave us an framed photo of us as a nice souvenir.   The room was spotless and the service throughout our stay was outstanding. Would definitely stay here again!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Absolutely amazing stay 10/10!,
"Nice and welcoming hotel at the end or Orchard road. Warm welcome, with very pleasant handling after 21 hours of flight. I was delighted to share my time in this hotel. If I may add some thoughts: Please think about breakfast room, because it is so loud and noisy, hard to stand. As well it looks like battlefield after rush time.  In total it is a nice place to rest and enjoy. Thank you.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Experience,
"I had another excellent stay at the Shangri-La. The staff, as usual, were phenomenal. Friendly, went out of their way to accommodate. The restaurants were A+ in terms of food and service. The one small thing I would say is that in the Garden Wing, my room did not have a traditional desk - only a round glass table which I worked at most days. In the future I would request that I be put in a room that has a working desk. Other than that - an extremely great stay and look forward to my return.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Excellent, outstanding stay",
The hotel is famous by its name and we booked the same through our travel agent.  The city is clean but the hotel is super cleaned. Staff are well behaved and the rooms no complaints at all. Pool is unique in the world and we really miss the hotel as we are back home. Thanks to the management ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Outstanding hotel,
i wish i could have stayed longer in shang SG. 2 nights isn't enough for the good service and delicious food . thumbs up. the buffet is so good. i wish they offer free shuttle services to tour around city but however it doesn't affectvthe overall stay,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,yay for us !,
Amazing and comfortable stay from the reception till the end. Got an early check in very comfortably. The rooms were neat and spacious. Beds were really comfortable. Washrooms had a bathtub separate than the bath area and was nicely spacious. The best part was the food. Amazing spread be it for the breakfast or lunch. The taste was not that great atleast for the Indian food which I can vouch for. Tasted continental stuff as well.  Desserts were just amazing and ample. Liked the sorbets and the geleto they have,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Amazing stay,
"With all the delicious food, I needed to workout and personal trainer Jason helped. He is extremely approachable after a quick analysis he managed to tailor each session according to my needs and limitations. They were enjoyable and fun with new routines. He has an extensive knowledge on the human anatomy. He is passionate and finds great fulfilment in seeing progress for his clients.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Personal Trainer at the Gym,
"It was a different take on Italian buffet for lunch. Everything was very fresh, clean and most loved dishes are available. Also the cleanliness and service of the restaurant was great.  They offer fresh pasta too which are made in a station in front of us.  I got intrigued with their a la carte menu since their buffet was spot on.  I called on one of their cooks that always strolls around the place and checking the food and I asked which one is best. Ms. Carolyn suggested the seafood pasta and true enough it was one of the best I have ever had.  I will be back for more dining and ambiance experience at Shangri la Orchard. Especially the restaurant.  Cheers!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Waterfall Ristorante Italiano,
"My family and friends were at Shangri la Singapore  to dine at The Line. After dinner we approached the concierge, Johnny at the lobby to help us to take a photo. He not only kindly obliged, but even recommended to assist to take more than 1 shot at various spots that were ""Shangri-la signature"" in the lobby. After which, he proceeded to engage with my child and gave her toy. It was excellent service given that we only required a simple photo. But he went above and beyond to put a smile on his guests. It is truly a privilege to have him as your staff. For recognition purpose, I was there on 9 September at around 9.45pm.  Thanks Johnny! You have given us memories of a lifetime in the few photos.

"This is a much delayed review for a night staycation that my wife and 6 years old daughter went 3 months ago in June 2019.  I'd like to commend the staff at check-in counter at that time. My wife was queueing for checking-in and it was busy afternoon with a lot of people queuing. My wife stayed in the queue and had to watch my daughter at the same time. The staff recognized this and they gave them priority. To my daughter's delights, they gave her a squirrel plush toy named ""chubby"". They also upgraded the room with tent which my daughter loves it so much to play in the room.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Memorable to the detail,
Had an amazing 2 night stay at the Shangri-la! Visited with my 2 year old daughter and wife this hotel is perfect for business travellers and families alike.   The breakfast was amazing with a great selection. We were fortunate it be in the newly renovated family floor which is perfect for anyone travelling with kids ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Why stay anywhere else!,
"I have stayed her many times. I am retired now and my memories of my stays are still strong. I loved the hotel, the pools and I ate at The Line almost every day at least 1x. I would go jogging to the Arboretum that was close by and then relax by the pool. It is in a good location and I would walk up and down Orchard either by myself. I was so glad that I brought my wife on one of my longer stays. I would also go to the Shangri-La on Sentosa but I don't think I ever spent the night. I would jog around Sentosa (not too far, ~4-5 miles) then come back and eat at the hotel and lay by their pool for awhile. I hope to come back soon if I can convince my wife :)",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,A delight!,
"We had a wonderful stay for two nights at the Valley Wing. Nothing more to expect, very friendly and helpful staff, excellent food and beverages, perfect accommodation. Highly recommended for a relaxed and stressless stay in Singapore",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellent,

Excellent all round. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly especially Yana and all the staff at reception. The room cleaners went out of their way by opening doors and lifts for us and the hotel porters were very professional and hospitable.  As for the room... it was very clean and comfortable with had a beautiful view. The breakfast in the hotel was delicious and again the staff at breakfast couldn't do enough for us. It had something for everyone from the family area to the health section we were not left hungry!!  The entire atmostphere in the hotel was lovely and I look forward to my next stay there.  ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellent service and very clean,
"Loved every moment of our stay here. We were presented with a fresh orchid upon arrival and taken to our room in the Garden Wing, which had a lovely balcony and view. A basket of fresh fruit was supplied in the room. We loved lounging around the pool - enjoying a fantastic selection of fresh drinks and healthy snacks. Other highlights included the lavish High Tea in the Rose Verandah, and the children's cookery lessons at Buds, which my daughter loved. Service was faultless throughout, staff are unfaililingly charming and helpful. We were even given a complimentary late check-out at 6pm due to a late flight leaving Singapore. Can't praise this hotel highly enough!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Singapore's ultimate luxe hotel,
"1 of the best hotels in SG! No complaints on all aspects. Breakfast including sparkling wine was great! Bed was very comfortable and had a peaceful sleep.

"Room was a bit dated, for a premium hotel that felt a bit unusual. The breakfast and pool are good but the hotel is a bit far from the centre. If you are comparing with the big hotels on price then worth looking elsewhere.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Mixed bag,
"Loved it! Our 5 year old loved going to Buds while we enjoyed the pool and a few drinks and snacks haha. But it's honestly like you are not in SG, we didn't want to leave the hotel and just enjoy the peace. Line is one of the best buffets I have experienced. We had a Garden Wing room, so beautiful and sitting on the balcony each morning for my Nespresso was perfect. Staff around the pool were amazing and I enjoyed a pool side massage and prosecco, it's just a great place if you really want to relax and treat yourself.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Perfect Singapore vacation for family,
"Lovely to be back since our last visit many years ago. The food and rooms have changed tremendously. There is more variety of food and the room is more modern.

We will come back again looking for him.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Exceptional experience,
"There is luxury and then there is the Shangri-la Hotel. It is the utmost in comfort, service  and facilities. The pool is excellent and so too is the spa services. there are several restaurants all of which are very good. The breakfast is huge and the highlight is the Sunday brunch which is very popular. There is a great play area for children and tennis courts with coaching. It is an easy walk down to Orchard road but due to the heat and humidity in Singapore it is normal to get a taxi back to the hotel. There are no metro stations close to this hotel but there is a free shuttle bus that goes every hour down into the main areas of Orchard Road.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Ultimate luxury,
"It is situated very close to the Orchard Road is a great location for shopping. There is a swimming pool landscaping is a good place to enjoy recreation in the city. Orchard Road has some attractions, including a daily shuttle bus running around Harbourfront station shuttles are attended by one on a weekday (Monday to Friday) morning. I and my group took a shuttle to the harbourfront, so there was a small number of people who took a taxi. Of course the fee was paid by the hotel. We enjoyed afternoon tea and cocktails in the club room. Both of them prepared more abundantly than other hotels. The night view is less than the hotels near Marina Bay, but I expect to stay at Shangri-La Hotel next time I go to Singapore again.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Very nice and comfortable hotel,

Went back down stairs and told them this was unacceptable.  After a couple of minutes, and him checking with his manager  we were moved to another room. As my bags were in  the first room, it took them roughly 30 minutes to transfer my bags. I had to visit reception again to get this done. Not good aervice, especially from a hotel that prides itself on service. The pool  was good. The bed was a bit harder then i am used to but ok. Overall, would stay somewhere else next time.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Not as good as expected ,
"My second review on this hotel. Great location, very friendly employees, we prefer the tower rooms as it is well renovated. will certainly return again.  One big disappointment is the Horizon club. While the setting, the offering is absolutely superb, the evening shift employees have an attitude that simply shouldn't be acceptable in any five star hotel. Same gentlemen as the last previous visits, and same dissatisfaction. One feels that he is in a constant bad mood and not welcoming at all. Removing empty plates, glasses from table ? Nope, he doesn't do it.   I am surprised that he did not have extra training what hospitality is all about.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"very good location, great hotel",

When we headed earlier but to the reception to enquirer if room was ready, ms stacey has recognised us and greeted us with smile. We felt recognised as more than a guest at the hotel!

"I come to Shangri-La in Singapore since 1986. It was at that time one of the only 5-star superior hotels with a more than excellent standard in service and accommodation.This has continued until today. The only negative point I can say is, that their award system ""Golden Circle"" and their reservation system did not work properly in my first 20 years with Shangri-La Hotels (Singapore and many other I have been), and so at least 20 Stays were not counted. Nevertheless I like Shangri-La and will come back - however certainly in less quantity as I am retired now and don't travel as much as before.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Still the standard in Singapore,

The hotel is a short cab ride to most sights, and it also has a free shuttle to Orchard Road for shopping. The gym is huge, and has a great steam room/sauna.

Each day we enjoyed afternoon tea or a generous three hour cocktails and canapes at the Club rooms, all complementary. The food at the Line Buffet was delicious with so many options to choose from. Our Deluxe King Room was spacious and up to date. The staff were so generous. We were able to use the hotel health club to have a shower and freshen up after we checked out so that we were fresh for our late night flight. We were even offered complementary club access that evening so that we were comfortable. If you're after the ultimate in first-class, luxury hotel experiences, go no further.

Great daily breakfast and lunch buffet at The Line with numerous choices. Relaxing spa (was able to book a massage within an hour after arriving at the hotel). Very nice pool view from my Tower Wing room. Loved that the Front Desk staff told me not to be alarmed if I saw someone in scuba gear in the pool after 10 pm - they were doing maintenance. Great afternoon ""Tea"" daily in the Horizon Club Lounge   For the meeting portion of our stay: Lotus I & II were a great size for our group of 20.

From every bathroom amenity you could require ( replenished daily) to the iconic Singapore views from the Horizon Club. Breakfast in the club has a decent and varied selection daily, and a Happy Hour with a different array of treats each day. Service is consistently excellent in each area of the hotel. From being escorted to the Horizon Club for an early check in, to our children having an absolute ball in the Kids Club.

I went home more relaxed than when I arrived due to the comfort of the rooms, quality of the catering and excellence of the staff.

"We stayed 4 nights in June.  We arrived late and had a quick check in.  Due to our status we were entitled to an up-grade if available, however there wasn't one available.  Our room was an unusual design with the bed on an angle.  We didn't like the layout it was difficult to move around, it was lovely and clean. The view from the room was nice.  The staff were wonderful especially in the Horizon Club lounge.  This hotel is extremely busy, especially the Foyer.  Heaps of choices from the buffet breakfast. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night it was OK. We easily walked to Orchard Road from here, however there is a shuttle, but we never used it.  We would stay again, but I would prefer a different room type.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great Hotel,

"Very friendly people all over. Especially as I arrive and depart usually in the morning, I have always the same team at the concierge table. However, as I mentioned already, I am not so happy anymore with the breakfast at the Horizon Club. Before the renovation it really was a very high level of luxury with a buffet and a very distinguished service by the team. Now all has been changed to self service and it is not the same feeling of luxury anymore. I normally compare it with Shangri-La Kowloon and there is a difference.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Staying again at Shangri-La Singapore,
"Shangri-La has 3 buildings (tower wing, garden wing and valley wing), and we have stayed in Valley Wing this time, it has a separate entry, the mini bar in room is free (non alcohol beverages only) and the lounge bar provides free drinks and afternoon tea throughout the day. For breakfast, you can choose to have breakfast just downstairs with more privacy or to have buffet breakfast in the tower wing, which is just 2 mins walk, I personally think that the buffet breakfast has better choices. The location is good, which you can walk to the malls in Orchard road!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Good service, nice location ",
Another great stay here over the weekend from start to finish which has become the expectation here. The welcome and the settling in is sublime with a comfy room.

"Our family enjoyed our stay in Shangrila from the moment we checked in the lobby. We were greeted by Veren - gave a stuffed toy and cookies to my daughter, welcome drinks to the whole family. Veren even took our family picture in the Shangrila Lobby and had it printed and sent to our room in a Shangrila  frame and note. The next day, there was a delicious birthday cake when we got back to the hotel ( it was my birthday).Everything was beautiful and the customer service was superb. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices , even for kids. Before checking out ,my daughter wrote a note to Veren saying how much she loved the hotel.

But it's OK and I appreciate the kind gesture. :)  The hotel facade looks dated but the rooms are actually refurbished and they look modern and sleek. The room is of decent size and can fit a baby cot nicely. Room service is impeccable and I love how they lay out the table for us.

"We only stayed at the Shangri-La hotel for one night but our expectations were definitely exceeded. The hotel is absolutely beautiful- very ornate and tastefully decorated. Staff were so efficient and really helpful. As soon as we arrived we were made to feel welcome.  The rooms are very luxurious, spacious and clean. I really appreciated the extra sweet gestures like the pineapple tarts left with a thank you note in the room.

"This is a beautiful hotel, with well appointed and well maintained rooms. The hotel pool is large and lovely. The only disadvantage of this hotel is that it is a bit off the beaten track: it is a good 5 to 10 min. walk from Orchard Rd. and another 5 min. to the metro station. That doesn't sound far (it isn't) but it is hot! in Singapore. If you want to see any of the sights in Singapore other than the shopping on Orchard Rd., this hotel is a bit less convenient that some others. But if you want a quiet getaway in the city, this may be right for you. The Chili Crab in the Lobby Lounge was a delightful surprise! It was the best we found in Singapore (small, but delicious).",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Beautiful hotel but a bit off the beaten track (Orchard Rd.),

The city/state of Singapore is exotic to many for sure, and the Shangri-La Hotel helps define this great place. The service was exceptional, and being walked to my room by the person checking you in was a new experience, who then went over my accommodations with me.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel, but is was excellent, and the selections by culture were impressive to see, that wherever you were from they had you taken care of.

While everything was lovely,  the rooms etc and the beautiful pool and gardens, the rooms were not cleaned very well during our stay. The food is exceptional, although very pricey! The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  Do yourself a favour though and before you book this hotel, find out whether there is a Conference being held there during your stay! 3 days of our 5 were busy with conferences and this spoilt the whole ambiance of the hotel! The beautiful foyer, restaurants etc were constantly crowded and very noisy with Conference attendees  - this spoilt our time there unfortunately.

From check-in where our 4 yr old was having a mini meltdown and calmed by a staff with a cookie and a stuffed toy to concierge and checkout.  Top experience all round.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Swing through SG - great hospitality,
"Perfect place to stay with kids - great accommodation (Family room), excellent staff, nice food! It is expensive but it worth it! It was our 10th visit to Shangri La Singapore hotel. It was always great and it's got even better!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Easter break in Singapore,
The room and the facilities plus the view lived up to the description. The staff kept the room immaculate. The bed was very comfortable and the air con worked to perfection. The staff in the restaurants were very helpful and if you did not like the food on offer the chef would make something for you.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"The staff made it a memorable holiday, always smiling and helpful.",
Staff and room was fantastic! My son enjoys playing at the pool so much and he kept asking to go play there every day (we stayed for 3 days). Buds by Shangri-la was also another favourite place where my son can play safely and enjoy his 'balls time'. Look out for the free shuttle bus service to Orchard Road as well! :)   Fun place as they added a special segment during Easter period - A chocolate theme exhibit/performance. My little one was also treated to a squirrel toy which he happily played with as well during our check in. I'll come back here again for a staycation if possible! :),5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Good place for your little one!,
"We stayed here for 2 nights before heading to Bali - and the property is luxurious and well located.   We were in a Deluxe Room in the Tower Wing - the room was amazing, great amenities, loads of space and immense bathroom. It has everything you can expect from a 5-star hotel. We played with the curtains command way too much.  The only aspect that didn't empress me much and I thought was not very well taken care of is the pool area - it felt like a condominial pool, not very intimate and cosy.  Overall it was a positive experience but the pool area should maybe get a bit more attention.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Amazing Rooms and Amenities,
Very welcoming arrival. Reception staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. our room in garden wing is spacious and with nice amenities. Special thanks to Juliet and peter of the lobby.they have gone out of their way to ensure the comfort of my mum and I. Also wish to mention Amira for the surprise birthday cake. No regrets staying here.  Steve.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Fabulous accommodation and staff,
Spent four nights here while on business. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and really could not be faulted. Room was excellent as was the food and best pool in Singapore by far.  Would certainly say here again,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Terrific service and hospitality,
"Have stayed here fore three nights in garden wing with my parents and celebrate Dads birthday.   Upon arrival at around 1500, room was already ready with an extra bed placed inside. I must say, the renovated lobby is really amazing!  Mr Azhar welcomed us during check in. He is really a sincere and professional hotelier The room assigned has a huge balcony which my parents really like.  All the staff are well trained and friendly especially those from front office and bellmen.   Though Garden wing was not renovated, the room is super suitable for family with a natural garden in the atrium.  Really highly recommend this hotel :)",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Extraordinary Renovated Hotel,
"Our room was extremely comfortable and my daughter was very much at home with the sofa bed at the bay window.  We also thoroughly enjoyed hanging out at the pool, ably attended by several lifeguards.  Best of all we loved the Horizon Lounge for a relaxing and delicious breakfast whilst admiring the views, cocktails in the evening and an afternoon tea. The lounge experience was certainly enhanced by the staff, who frankly were all excellent ....Amir deserves to be commended for his handling of children, as well as Baoling and Anand;  apologies for not remembering all the names including the bar men who made superb cocktails!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Another Excellent Stay,
"I was just dropping in to this hotel on my way, to enquire on their Buds Easter Event coming up. Was warmly greeted by their staff Annie (whom I noticed her name on her badges) as I entered thru the main entrance at the lobby. Told her I was just looking around and wanted to find out about their Buds (for my kid). She was very nice and helpful to point me the way and took time to explain about their event and their beautiful decorations set up at their main lobby. I liked the service I received, every staff I noticed would have a nice smile on their face and greet the people. Would certainly return for a staycation next time with my family (and let my kid play at Buds of course)!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Luxury hotel feel and very friendly staffs!,
"We had a recent short stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. From the moment our car pulled up outside until we left, we could not fault the service from all members of staff with whom we had contact.  Our room was well appointed, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The only problem we had is that our stay was far too short!!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellent customer service,
"The hotel is super kids friendly, they were always nice to us, try to help in any way we needed. The kids playroom was amazing!!! The kid bed in the room was so cute like a tent, which made my son very excited to sleep in.   Rajin in the concierge was the best guy in the hotel, he helped me so much!! Super nice person and very very helpful!   I highly recommend the hotel for families, the swimming pool is not very exciting , but was good enough for us. The Italian restaurant next to the swimming pool was amazing!  ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Best service I had! ,
"Great location near Orchard Road, nice pool area and tropical garden. Very nice selection of different breakfast options, Asian, European, fresh fruits, noodle soup prepared your style etc. Even with your have booked a club room I advise to have breakfast down by the pool instead of at the club level, where there is a much more restricted selection.

Stayed here after 7 days in Hong Kong and it was luxury compared the hotel in Hong Kong. The manager Jimmy couldn't do enough for us and welcomed us like life long friends.  The breakfast buffet was almost as big as the buffets we had in Las Vegas a few years back. They even had a gluten free and vegan section which was great for me and my daughter.  It is in a good location close to MRT. We stayed in the served apartments which also gave us access to the hotel amenities.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Awesome Place to Stay,

"From location (half way between Orchard Rd and the Botanical Garden), to Reception, rooms, amenities, a top place in Singapore! We had a conference, all was superbly organized. Dinner in the Chinese Restaurant was deliciously superb. Only remark, since many people (as I) walked the 5-10 minutes to Orchard Rd, and 15 min to the Botanical Garden, the access from Orange Grove Rd to the hotel is totally ""pedestrian-unfriendly"". I tried on several occasions both entry and exit driveway, and got almost run over by fast accessing or leaving cars, without a pedestrian sideway. This should be retrofitted to make the hotel perfect!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Truly top hotel,
"We stayed in The Valley wing and would highly recommend it. All the staff were excellent and very helpful. On finding out I was vegan they went to a lot of effort to provide vegan options for breakfast, afternoon tea, and even wine. The pool area is nice and was never crowded and the champagne provided in the lobby was welcome after coming in from the heat. The metro is a short walk away (10 min) but there is also a shuttle bus from the hotel. Look forward to visiting again.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Fantastic,

"A close ride from Orchard Street, an excellent location. Rooms are good and well maintained. Staff overall are good except I had a not-so-pleasant experience with one of the front desk staff. We had five rooms and I needed to have a late check out for one of the rooms and she would not budge! I had to talk to a different front desk staff to sort this out.  The pool is really nice, a 40m one, so it is very good for the morning swim. I would stay there again if I come back to Singapore. ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Excellent location, good experience ",
"First class hospitality. You are greeted and looked after from the moment you walk in. The lobby is amazing, high ceiling, spacious and  lots of natural lighting.

A really classy place and great standards of upkeep despite the hotel being there for 30 years. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Faultless ,

"I stayed here three nights on business.  The property is gorgeous. Although it's been there for some time, it's been recently renovated. The lobby in particular is gorgeous, bright, and airy.

I'll be back!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Modern luxury,
Throughly enjoyed my visit at a wonderful hotel. The entire staff was outstanding and looked after me as it was my first trip to Singapore.    The concierge Johnny was spot on the entire trip and arranged my transportation for my business days and a guide (Gabriel - outstanding also) for a 4 hour tour and lunch in Chinatown.    Peter at check-in arranged for a discounted amount to extend my stay into the evening as my Emirates flight to Dubai was very late.  I travel to many places for business and forget quickly the experience but not the Shangri-La - should be 6 stars available - BTW the young  lady bartender in Origins was great too!,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Quiet sanctuary after business meetings ,
"Lovely hotel as always with the shangri la.  We did have a few problems with the cleanliness of our balcony as a prior guests to clippings were still present but this was dealt with after our second complaint, the first complaint may have been misunderstood due to language.  Nice size rooms and bathroom   Hotel food and drink expensive, but so is most of Singapore.   Free postcards in the room which are also posted for free which was a nice bonus.   The staff also gifted our baby girl a soft toy which was lovely.   Pool area always very busy and hard to find free sunbeds although I think many were empty or saved. Would be good if staff could clear empty beds as people left   Overall lovely stay and would return ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Lovely as expected, but a few cleaning issues",
We recently had a City day stay in the Valley Wing and felt that we must share our opinion of the superb hotel and service provided. We have stopped in many first class hotels but this was definitely up there with the best. The only minor criticism that we would make intended in a positive way was that there was a lack of parasols for guests. Thank you to all the staff whose service was outstanding we would definitely go back.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,An excellent holiday,
"I always ask myself if I would stay at a hotel again? With the Shang Ri La not only would I stay there again I would travel just to stay there! The level of service and genuine friendliness of all the staff is excellent and they are credit to the hotel and Singapore. We stayed in the Horizon wing and had access to the lounge there , which is worth the cost . Thank you to all the staff at the Shang Ri La and particularly at the Horizon lounge . ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellent hotel and service ,
We have been many times to this hotel and it is one of the best in the world! The service is just outstanding and the people working here are going the extra mile for you to allow you feeling very special.

The outdoor area is lovely with a nice swimming pool and a nice indoor gym. ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Staying at Valley Wing is like a paradise ,
"Lovely hotel that seems pretty busy but crowded. Great breakfast, service and the grounds are kept up perfectly. It's a little bit back from the main road but is like an oasis in the middle of the city. Upgraded the room and had an amazing balcony and great view. Would love to come for a vacation.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Gorgeous hotel and great service,
"Think this was my 4th or 5th stay, i never look for any other hotel in SG as Shangri La just works for me so well, simply beautiful.  The staff, atmosphere and aroma are great.  From the pick up at the airport to the gentlemen on the door and then the greeting at check in it simply works.  Although i travel and stay on business at this hotel i would have no hesitation in staying as a family here as it is child friendly. Very Well done and thank you everyone once again - PERFECT",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,I wish it was CLOSER!,
"Great start with the meet and transfer service from the airport. After a long flight, lovely to be greeted and welcomed. The driver rang ahead to say we were almost at the hotel, and so was taken straight to my room by the Receptionist. I enjoyed swimming in the pool, using the shuttle to the transit at Orchard road, the coffee and bakery items from the little shop in the lobby, and 2 very nice room service meals. I wasn't quite as impressed by breakfast as I anticipated - thought the choice of fruits might have been wider - but that is being picky. Another positive experience that will encourage me to stay in a Shangi La hotel again.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,wonderful experience,
"Was excited about the prospect of staying at the Shangri-La but was pretty underwhelmed by what, although a solid 4 stars, did not match the 5 star experience I was expecting. I am sure they do have 5 star rooms but ours in a tower wing deluxe room was definitely 4 star. Clean and nothing wrong with it just lacking that little something extra.  The location is a bit out of the way of everything but they do have a free shuttle bus which takes you in the general direction of Orchard Road. Breakfast at the Line restaurant was great with a massive choice including everything you could think of pretty much, however the decor is very ""UK motorway cafe"" which lets it down.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,A solid 4 star experience,
"The hotel is a typical 5* international hotel. We did not get a chance to use facilities like the pool, which looked great. Rooms were comfortable with great bed, bathroom and in room facilities.The staff were helpful and friendly in a very respectful way. Breakfast was superb and i would recommend it for its breadth of choice as well as its quality.The location of the hotel is slightly away from any public transport and shops, but there is a free shuttle bus provided every 30 mins or so.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,up to the usual brand standards,
"Was visiting origin bar and got kinda lost. Lady at the front desk was so helpful. Not only did she escorted me to the bar, she made sure that I was attended to before leaving my friends and I.

"Shangri La is one of my favorite chains and it was exciting to stay in Singapore at the first structure, built in 1971. A classic hotel, with ample space, a wonderful reception, a large and romantic garden enriched by a beautiful swimming pool. The rooms are nice and comfortable, the staff professional and kind. Only note a little out of the breakfast room that I think is not aligned with the style of the hotel. Poolside service excellent: the attendat cleaned my glasses, freshened me with water spray and offered delicious frozen grapes. Speed check in and check out. A sureness in Singapore.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,The First of the chain,
"We have recently been to two group dinners at the Shang - a buffet for about 30 pax at the Dutch Pavilion and a Lo Hei for over 200 pax in the Tower Ballroom. The food is not the best albeit quite good considering the size of the groups, but the service is truly impressive, especially at the huge banquet: efficient and thoughtfully proactive. The audiovisual equipment and acoustics in the ballroom are excellent. A very good catering choice for weddings or corporate events.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Service with a bang at the Shang ,
It was a amazing dinner served at The Line. Gobi and another Indian guy was excellent. They have been so helpful with my kids and very experienced staffs. As well as staffs like Sherie whom welcomed us at the door way and Nithya whom assisted us to The Line. They are just so friendly and gave us a warm smile. Thank you once again and will for sure come again. ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Brilliant service ,
"The hotel is beautiful inside and out.  Walking distance to shopping and restaurants.  The lounge on top had an incredible view.  Like a lot of Singapore the prices are quite high, a glass of wine or drink is at least $22.  The rooms are technologically advanced with touch lighting that is actually a bit of a hassle to get used to.  The electronic shades were a nice touch and the balcony was outstanding with the view of the city.  An outstanding hotel but a price tag to go with it.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Beautiful Hotel,
"My family has been staying at the Shangri-La for many years. It consistently never fails to meet expectations, delivering exceptional service and superb rooms. Our experience is always heightened by Cory Ann Wright, who delivers personalised and warm service. She is one of the reasons we keep coming back to the hotel. Furthermore, every member of staff (particularly around the pool and at the Line) is exceptional and makes you feel right at home. I have no hesitation in recommending the Shangri-La Singapore.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Exceptional stay and service!!,
"Not in the Marina Bay area or within walking distance of Orchard Road shopping, though remodeled, this vast 850 or so  room hotel would not have been my first choice, having stayed at several other hotels and clubs on prior visits to Singapore.  We were booked for a one night pre-cruise stay included in our cruise fare. Our room in the tower wing had the king bed at a peculiar angle to accommodate a not too large room with a not to large bathroom, both of which appear to have been recently remodeled.  The view from this seventh floor room of a roof top was not particularly inviting.  Breakfast was equally unremarkable in a vast and unattractive buffet restaurant.  I don't know what the cruise line paid, but I would feel cheated if I were paying at the rack rate.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Unremarkable hotel, out of the way for shopping and attractions",
"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  Staff professionalism, courtesy, charm and efficiency are a major factor; also the excellent, large pool and gardens.  Our room was a good size and extremely well equipped and comfortable.    Origin Bar provided wonderful and strong cocktails ; the in house Chinese restaurant was excellent too.    This is not the cheapest place to stay but is worth every local dollar.  Strongly recommended.    ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Superb ,
"My husband & I stayed for 5 nights on our honeymoon. We booked the king room with Horizon club access. From check in to check out the service was the best I have come across yet.

Would definitely recommend. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Most amazing experience. ,
I arrived from India to Singapore on a red eye flight at 7:30am. I got to the ShangriLa before 8:00am.

"The team at Shangri-La knows how to keep up to the reputation of the brand they work for & the team just did that when we went to Singapore for our Annual Meet for Top Performers. We reached early morning & instead of staying back with the group for sight seeing, we took a cab & reached the hotel 4 hours before our expected arrival. The team took care even then & extended us all the help to get us a room much before with the help of our travel team. The service at the hotel is simply superb & quick, the staff is ever courteous, the food prepared for our event was lip smacking. The rooms are spacious with a beautiful view & is just 5-7 minutes away from Orchard Road. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Superb Experience!,
"I was extremely happy with this hotel which has undergone recent improvements.  This includes its Buds Club for children, a full on indoor play zone with super convenient coffee shop and outdoor play zone.  My boys loved it and spent so many hours there. Plus the beautiful outdoor pool area.   The only downside was we believed the downstairs buffet was overpriced, and on arrival of our first night we experienced very bad service there - not typical of such a beautiful hotel... we therefore avoided that restaurant for the rest of our stay.  I would be happy to return to this hotel in future trips.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Extremely Family Friendly Fun,
The chef preparing bread at the Tandoor - Shakil is phenomenal with his smile and service as well. He prepared the fresh dough and made hot bread for the team.

It was a delightful getaway with our child for her advanced birthday celebration. A small top up to the room in garden wing came with a balcony with wider room space.

Overall good stay.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,2 Nights Stay,
"the staff and the hotel are great, however we found the food in the main foyer wasnt the best, breakfasts had plenty of choice. You are walking distance to Orchard Rd where there are lots of shopping malls and restaurants but will need to take a cab everywhere else which is easy to do and fairly cheap. The pool is nice when there arnt many people around, we found guests put a towel onto the beds to secure it for the whole day which was annoying. Our room was clean and tidy, overall our stay was very good",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,pleasant stay,
We stayed at this hotel for two nights following our ten day cruise. The staff welcomed us even though we arrived three hours before check in. It is just a few blocks from the shopping area but with the humidity it felt like more. The best shopping is underground as we accidentally discovered when trying to figure out how to cross a street. The hotel appears to be in a residential district so if you're not going to eat at the hotel you have to walk to the shopping district. I hung out by the pool on my last day and it was lovely and relaxing. The italian restaurant onsite is just ok and I probably would not go there again. The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and they had a ton of choices.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Well maintained hotel right near the main shopping district,
"Great, but expensive hotel for a family. My kid loved the play area. Food is great, however bit on the expensive side. For example, lunch buffet will cost you around SG$ 75 per person (150 for two) where two people can dine very well under SG$50 in most of the other restaurants in the city. Service is wonderful as always. Will come again soon.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Best place for a family with kids,
"This hotel is full of provisions and services that match and fulfill your needs.  Staff are abundant [wonder how many ""rovers"", just waiting for your requests, or questions, are plainclothes security folk], and willing to please.  Had to check out early for a flight, so did note get to sample the Breakfast.  However had Room Service dinner of Singaporean Laksa, and it was extremely delicious and generous.

The service is excellent, and Melissa and the rest of the staff in the Horizon Club could not be more helpful. The Shang Palace Chinese restaurant is as good as ever - we ate there twice this time.

Definitely the best hotel in Singapore.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Wonderful hotel,

"Our stay at the recently renovated Shangrila exceeded expectations. Both the high ceilinged lobby and guest rooms exude luxurious refinement.  Service is excellent throughout. I particularly like the well equipped gym, which looks out onto the lush landscaped gardens. The lobby now has a section which serves local hawker favorites for breakfast, or afternoon tea; which includes Nasi Lemak & Chicken Rice. Highly recommended.  Taxis can take longer to come, so allow yourself ample time.

"stayed another two nights in Valley Wing on our way back from NZ to Europe. And again, it was a perfect stay - thks to the Valley Wing staff who were so helpful. When the room above ours was a bit noisy (newlyweds...), they immediately moved us onto a different floor the next morning, so all good. Shangri-La remains the hotel of our choice in Singapore.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,yet again: a perfect stay,
"Although the exterior is looking a bit dated, the renovation of rooms in the tower block makes them ideal for the business or leisure traveller. Whilst not the largest rooms that you might expect in a luxury hotel, the layout is very functional. However, when all is said and done, you mainly sleep in your room whereas you live in the hotel and here is where the Shangri-La shines. The service is impeccable. We invested in a club room and the amenity of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapes on the 24th floor was complemented by the warm welcome provided by the staff. Similarly, the staff around the pool couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming. Although our children are grown-up, the kid's club looks amazing and we hope to return with grandchildren someday.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Service with a smile,

We were served very well by the staff there and they attended to all our needs very quickly and kindly.   Frankly I never expected the same level good care and attention we are used to receiving at Star class hotels in Sri Lanka in Singapore, but to my surprise the hotel staff at Shangri La Singapore were exceptionally very kind and caring.

"on a stop over for a couple of days flying between Scotland and New Zealand.  i have been lucky enough to stay here previously, but not for a number of years.  the hotel is beautifully appointed and has wonderfully attentive staff.   i stayed in the Garden wing with a pool view, which i would say is the ideal if you are willing to pay the premium for a balcony.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Top quality hotel,
"This is a very comfortable hotel, in a great location for Orchard Road shopping and many sightseeing activities. The range of food available within the hotel is very broad, and room service is reasonable. The thing that will do your head in is the lighting in the rooms! It is a strange puzzle to get just the level of lighting required as lights are grouped onto switches. We were alternately dazzled or plunged into complete darkness as we tried to get it right! Sunset from the Horizon Club is not to be missed.   ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Comfortable hotel,
"Stayed 2 nights in the Tower of this totally charming Hotel. Very relaxing in a great location on the hill just a short walk to Orchard Road.  Surrounded by beautiful gardens and with a swimming pool area and large well appointed rooms, you feel as if you are truly in a Resort.  The Executive Lounge is second to none with the most capable  staff led by Jenny who provided an amazing friendly service and helpful information on how we should spend our time in Singapore.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,SIMPLY THE BEST,
"Our suite in the Valley Wing was spacious and well appointed. Very impressed by all the staff, always smiling and very helpful. The Horizon Club, renovated since our visit last year, impressed with the selection of finger food and fine wine. However the highlight was the staff. We were surprised that the lovely Angeline was a trainee. She presented as an experienced professional, courteous and always smiling and ready to help. And of course Amir was the experienced professional, who supervised wonderful service by all the staff. The omelettes made by Connie are a must have. The Origin Grill was great, and we were privileged to meet the Head of Cuisine, Heidi.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,4 WONDERFUL DAYS,
"Everything about our stay was top notch: our room, the breakfasts, the Horizon Lounge, Nami Japanese restaurant, and the public spaces. The service was uniformly warm and professional. We reserved through Amex Plat Fine Hotels and instead of upgrading our room, we were given access to the Horizon Lounge, a much better benefit. We loved our room in the Garden Wing and can't wait to stay at Shangri-La again!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Perfect stay,
"Room was spacious and had everything required. I am disabled and the room was one of the best for people like me that I have encountered. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The included breakfast was excellent and the range of food impressive. The hotel  appearance, particularly the gardens, was of the highest standard.  The only disappointment was the room service meal, which was rather bland and not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Excellence !,
"Visited this establishment to have dinner with my friends at origin bar and grill. All I can say is that atmosphere at the bar is something that is not to be missed. Lighting is nicely dimmed (romantic), attentive wait staff, music is not too loud where you can have a comfortable conversation with whoever that you're there with, and also feast your eyes and tastebuds on their wide range of cocktails. For a complete experience, visit the restaurant section which features unique and delectable dishes that's carefully crafted to please your instagram followers and stomach.

"The staff are attentive and personalised. Service standard is high and they makes the hotel guests feel pampered. For example, staff who will hold the lift for guests if they happen to be there even at other levels, staff who will smile and acknowledge you when they see you, etc. They even prepared a kitkat cum M&Ms birthday cake for my younger girl who celebrated her birthday during her stay - she was beaming with joy when she saw the beautiful cake.   There are indoor and outdoor facilities to keep the kids occupied and happy - allowing the parents to catch a breather. The kids and i are very happy and enjoyed our stay here.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience and keep up the good work! Well done to the service crew! Keep up the great work!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Staycation with the kids at Shangri-La Singapore,
"What impressed me most about this hotel is their arrangements for breakfast. You choose from a menu and it is served at your table and mercifully you do not encounter the roomful of dishes at a buffet that most hotels now offer. I stayed at the Valley Wing. The rest of the stay was comfortable, satisfying and I will very much recommend it to anyone willing to spend more for the comfort of a suite. The rooms are well appointed. The TV in living room is good but the one in the bedroom is not of the same standard. The staff are pro active and polite which is, to my mind which is the great differentiator of a great hotel.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Valley Wing is certainly a luxury hotel.,
"Stayed in the Tower Wing which had very noisy and old ventilation system.  Key card did not work because the card reader was out of battery.  The furniture in the Family Suite had sharp edges posing risks to children. Very rough facial tissues and toilet papers, only provided softer ones after request. Makes one wonder if the management is cutting cost. Service was just ok and not particularly efficient.  Hard to believe this is Shangri-la's flagship property.",2.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Big Disappointment,
Went to Shangri-la Singapore in mid Oct2018 for a conference and find it a nice place to be in. The City View it gives is so serene as it does not show you the city traffic and you intend to have a feeling of living in a country side property. Nice and Courteous staff with good facilities around. became more famous after famous Kim Trump Summit. Walkable distance from famous Orchard Road for all Shopohlic people who want to pick their liking stuff day in day out.

"We loved the hotel. The amenities are many and so well laid out. The pool and pool area are great for anyone including families. So accessible. I did not give the rating an excellent as A few of the employees were not as hospitable as the last two Shangri-La hotels we stayed at in Thailand on this trip. For example, the Consierge would not give us a steak house recommendation outside the hotel because he wanted us to eat in the hotel. My guess is he was somehow connected to the restaurant. That recommendation at the Origin was not a good experience. We missed a good night on the town because of this gentleman. Just please be honest.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Beautiful hotel,
"As in the past we once again came back for the Iconic fare at Rose verandah . Whilst the ambience look and feel is always fresh the food item spread  and desserts were as usual very well presented and tastes also delicious . The Japanese sushi sashimi were good however could have been better . Same for the  dimsums - taste average . The sea bass in local Sambal chilli sauce was a nice addition as was the sea food Catalana made up of squid, prawn and salmon ... The hazel nut ice-cream and strawberry sorbet were superb.  The choice of teas and coffees was as good as any where else if not better . Highly recommended !",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Brunch at Rose verandah ,

Great experience by any measure. Staff were very welcoming and attentive on arrival and check-in.  Room upgrade is never a bad thing and our was excellent.

However, what surprised me is that staff is always composed and able to deal with different guests' requests with no major hassle. Staff we bumped into always smile and courteous, which i was most impressed and a reflection of a world-class training and truly a 5-star hotel. Please keep up the good work. Shuttle to Orchard Rd is also handy, but do get full quickly. Otherwise it is a short-stroll or a short taxi ride.

However a special mention about the concierge, Johnny and Arif. Both these gentlemen were extremely helpful, cheerful and helped our stay in Singapore special. They gave us information on places to visit and the restaurants to eat. As we were in the country for a limited time actually drew up a plan that allowed us to experience the whole city in a short time. Even experienced travel consultants would not be able to do this",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,A great hotel. Amazing Concierge,

We made several requests and all were acceded to, and even went above and beyond!  I don't know how to better describe such a pleasant, smooth and relaxing stay with my pregnant wife and 2 year-old son.

Wow, what attention to detail - we never mentioned my birthday. Very touching. The restaurants and pool facilities were excellent. Easy distance to Orchard Rd and easy to get taxis anywhere.

We had a fantastic stay in the garden wing of the Shangri La.  The rooms are lovely  and the swimming pool and gardens are beautiful .  My children really appreciated the amazing breakfasts especially the donuts. There are a couple of people who deserve a special mention including the lovely lady who makes the eggs at breakfast.  She always has a smile whilst cooking delicious dishes for a number of people at once.  The other person who made a special effort is the lady who took the room service orders who remembered the not only the names of my children but also what combinations of food they ordered!

The breakfast in the summit room was fabulous, service excellent and the food fantastic. Afternoon tea in the lobby wonderful, we typically went out walking and exploring in the morning so to come back and have lovely tea and cakes was great.

This is away from hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd but close enough for a 10 minute walk to be amongst the action.

"Exceptional rooms and an amazing set of facilities, particularly for families. Nice swimming pool with a dry and wet play area for kids. The Buds kids club is also fantastic for younger children.  Some slight negatives would be the aging wet area in the fitness centre. Nothing wrong with it all, includes a hot pool, sauna and steam room with extensive changing facilities. But it is starting to look a bit old and worn in places.  The other slight negative is that the hotel seemed very busy, and less personal to when we last visited. We were there about 8 years ago and things seemed more friendly and personal then, whereas we felt like we were just being processed in a very busy hotel on this occasion.  However, still a great place that I would return to.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Amazing for families,

And when it was my turn to check in, they said that we still have to wait because the rooms were not yet ready.  They said it politely but was quire dissapointed because it was already 4 pm. We Waited again for 30 more minutes.  When i requested for a late check out (just an additional 1 hour) to compensate their late checkin i was declined. I asked again and they refused again.

Hotel is luxurious, thoughtful, with a decent mix of dated n modern flavour. Rooms are ok , with a separate nice view of the pool or the skyline. Breakfast was crowded and extremely busy during weekends may be. Good variety of food from different cuisine. My only negative is staff. They don't communicate clearly, don't wish you. Very very business like attitude. Could be more personal which gives a nice touch. ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Good but could be great!,

I even told them I stayed there a month ago, but they still could not find it.   Then the room service... A sgd 42 burger came in a plastic tray, covered with clear plastic foil. Economy class food on a plane looks more attractive than that",2.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Dissapointung,
"Spend a week here at Shangri-La Singapore for business. This place is spectacular for stay, for its luxurious and homely feel. No wonder this place was always choosen for important events.  Had a little confusion over my reservation although I stayed here few times before. But that was resolved pretty quickly. I would say the best part of my stay here is the cleanliness of the entire hotel. Being very particular with cleanliness, this is why I appreciate my company for choosing this hotel among others. Bed is very comfortable that you can be sure of a good night sleep.   The hotel is just 30 minutes away by taxi from the airport and stone throw away from the shopping belt. Recommended to business travellers.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Comfortable Stay,
Visiting here with my partner. We both enjoyed our staycation during weekend!  The breakfast was excellent the staff service was fenomenale. By the pool there is a squirrel jumping around the tree.   Verdict : Definitely will come back again here soon with my partner to spend another quality time ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Refreshing Staycation ,
I stayed at the Valley Wing and as always the stay is exceptional as the service and food at the Valley Wing is exceptional.  Fortunately it was off-peak as otherwise the Valley Wing would be crowded with its regular guests.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great stay,
Stayed at the Shangrila Hotel for 5 nights - mostly for a work conference using both the ballroom and the conference rooms on level 4.   Staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  I had heard about the breakfast at this hotel but it really was something to behold.   Anything and everything you could imagine were laid out for you to choose for your breakfast.  Service was cheerful and fast.  Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable.,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Conference and mini break,
"This was a lovely hotel. We picked it as the standard size room could accommodate my family of 4. One child slept on a pull out bed and one on the sofa. Room worked out great.  However location wasn't ideal for young children if planning to use the subway as it was a good 20 minute walk (with 3 year old) to Orchard station. After a couple of days we gave up and took taxis. There was an hourly shuttle bus to the station, but it was tiny and unless we were at the front of the queue stood no chance of getting on.  Breakfast was very good but very crowded and out of 4 mornings we were not once able to get orange juice as it kept running out.  Lovely pool and grounds.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,lovely hotel but not ideal location for young family,
"One would never say the buildings are over 50 years old. The architecture and decor are fresh and inviting. Maintenance levels are remarkable. We stayed in the Valley Wing section of the hotel and the room amenities were superb. The bedside pedastal provided as usual a bible and refreshing the teachings of Budda however a copy of the Quran was missed.  My wife developed a reaction to the jasmin fragranced bath soaps and housekeeping without question immediately replaced with an alternate fragrance.  Of note on checking-in the gentleman at the front desk Mr Yong Long was quick in upselling us to the better appointed Horizon Club package. Will I return to the hotel, a resounding ...Yes!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Another superb hotel by Shangri-La,
"The place is just beautiful! Nice foyer when you arrive, very nice room (heard some are not yet renovated though), the pool is very nice and the pool bar even better in the evening. Breakfast just amazing, very broad range of food - I actually loved the coffee place that is part of the breakfast buffet. The service overall is just totally outstanding!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Fantastic hotel,
"I stayed at the Shangri-La on the tail end of a business trip. The service was pretty good in the hotel, but the room was lack luster for the price.  Old, outdated and not very clean.  Other drawback was the location, it is outside of the central business district and not very convenient for walking into town. This appears to be a place for families given all the amenities for kids, so it might be on point for that. Seems overpriced for the condition of the room.",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Pretty hotel, but not centrally located",
"Shangri-La is well known hotel chain and the Singapore hotel after twin renovation of it's garden wing and main tower has made the hotel look new again. It has three main wings and also the large service apartments and also the short / long stay apartments. The full complex is very large and has all the amenities. It is also well located just off Orchard road. All the restaurants like the Japanese, Shang Place (Chinese) the Italian one are great places to dine in but on the expensive side. The Chi Spa is fantastic and the pool is just great. Lovely property and great staff but the in room dining may take time to get the food orders.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Super nice hotel,
"My previous stay at a deluxe room was awesome. This time, I was provided with a standard room, which was also good. Service is great, even though check in before 3pm can be challenging if not inform beforehand, but the hotel provides good amenities for the guest to enjoy while waiting. The Line restaurant was among the best Hotel Buffett in Singapore, even better than the choices offered by the Fullerton Hotel.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,One of the best luxurious hotel,
"When I checked in, Alex Lee walked me to my Valley tower and welcomed me with excellent service and warm greetings.

Enjoy your time and this hotel offers plenty of service.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Staff makes the hotel stay wonderful,
Oh where to start? On this visit to Singapore we decided to splurge and stay at the Shangri-La. Not in the everyday person Tower Wing but in the very special person Valley Wing. It is special indeed! Yes there are dress standards but that is only appropriate when there are special drinks including Veuve Cliquot flowing from 11:00 - 22:30 in the lounge. There is high tea & snacks &  reading glasses to go with the newspapers & very attentive staff in fancy dress. Our room was superb and the daily breakfast in the Summit Room was a delightful way to start the day. A delight that could only be improved if they served bubbly wine. And the pool and the complimentary massages were the best!,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,The Valley Wing - Magnificent ,
"This place is amazing for families I cannot get over how the family room is so fun for the kids with the tree house bed and the colours, every detail was thought of all the kids amenities are provided with some organic products, bathrobes and slippers even a foldable baby bath tub!

Facilities are just perfect , biggest Gym I have ever seen in a hotel and the Horizon lounge is fantastic. I would like to extend a very special thank you to Lynn at reception who not only made me feel very welcome when I arrived late at night but recognised me when I checked out 5 days later.

"On 28th May I made a returned visit to The Line at Shangri La which I do once a month. I was overwhelmed to be greeted by my favourite Italian Chef and Grace my favourite hostess. It was a surprise for me because these two lovable people are supposable on vacation but when they checked the reservation list they realised that I would be present on 28th May. Both of them cancelled their vacation to serve me. Ooh they really do me proud! Grace even posed a picture with me during the dinner. So sweet of her. I truly enjoyed myself that evening eating all the sumptuous food from appetiser to main course, finishing with desserts, not forgetting gelato icecreams. I went home feeling proud and loved.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Exceptional Service,

Pleasant stay though there was initial hiccups.  Few miscommunications during check-in but generally staff is quite quick to respond. Location not very convenient though it is near to orchard road.

Spent a week at this hotel and would definitely go back.  Very nice rooms with all the necessary amenities and more.  Inside the hotel has a great bar/entry with high ceilings in an almost atrium like feel.  I was there for leisure and business.  Hotel worked great for both.  Staff and service in the hotel were top notch.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful with any requests or inquiries we had.    ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great hotel and experience!,
It is not only a perfect business hotel. Also for a relaxing day on the poolside it is a perfect location. Very central but within the extensive well maintained gardens it is another world. Various restaurants cater for about every taste. ,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Pearl in Singapore,
The recently renovated Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore was an absolute joy to stay in. The spacious rooms and magnificent lobby were excellent just the beginning. The complimentary buffet breakfast was astounding in quality and scope. The restaurants on the premises were very good. The overall service was excellent,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great Hotel,
"I've stayed at a few Shangri-La's and I can positively say that this is one of the few brands that is truly hospitable - and not just at the face of it. The hotel is enormous, the way a five star should be - probably because it is a relatively old hotel and not your typical high rise. Though old, the refurbishment has been top notch and there is nothing that suggested the hotel's age.  The pool is huge and so is the buffet - right next door so feasting after a dip seems justified. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Hospitality from the core,
Spent 2 days here before setting out on a cruise to Myanmar.  Stunning hotel in extensive gardens with orchids galore - who need to go to the Botanic Gardens with this on display! The room was lovely.  We sank into the bed after a long trip from London non-stop with BA. (which by the way was also surprisingly good).  It oozed luxury and we loved it.  Excellent staff and the customary enhanced level of customer care from the entire team.  Would certainly recommend this hotel.  Free shuttle bus operates to the shopping district with further easy access from there via the metro rail all across the city.  Such a safe place to wander around.  Can't fault a thing about it.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Exquisite hotel in fabulous Singapore,
"If you like genuine Italian food then this is the best place in Singapore without doubt. The service is second to none, attentive yet discreet. Tony our waiter was always available and willing to help with anything we needed but without doubt the reason for this excellent restaurant delivering excellent service and outstanding food is down to he manger Andreano who being Italian understands what people expect. For the management of the Shangri La hotel please note that this manager is doing the hotel chain proud.   Want authentic Italian food ? Visit this restaurant,  you want be disappointed!!!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Italian restaurant ,

We stayed in the Valley Wing which is essentially a 5 star small hotel within the larger Shangri La Hotel. Service and room were excellent. The main hotel which is much larger is fine but much noisier and more larger group focused. Central for pretty much anywhere in the city.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Great first stop on our South East Asia Tour,

"We recently stayed at the hotel for three nights prior to a cruise and would be happy to stay again the next time we visit Singapore.  We upgraded to a garden room and as it was our honeymoon they gave us several goodies.  We had breakfast outside of the Waterfall restaurant two mornings which was really lovely,the selection of food and the service was very good,however it was closed on the third morning and we had to go the main restaurant and queue for a table,it was very very busy and service and food was not up to the usual Shangri-La standards.  We enjoyed drinks in the lounge which were the usual price for a five star hotel.  But normally its the service from all staff which makes this hotel group stand out from the rest.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Amazing service,
"Don't know where to start?! From the moment we arrived to Valley Wing, until we checked out was just like 4 days in heaven! The Valley Wing itself is fantastic and the staff is likely the best hotell staff in the world. I can't recall all the names, but to mention a few; Vanessa and Aeisha in the front dest; always smiling, relaxed friendly and helpful. Our new French friend, Dominique who made our breakfasts memorable.   We had a slight problem with our room which was taken care of in the best possible way, thanks Vanessa!

Thanks to Stephen for his brilliant services and for making the evening so special. The menu is customise to suit taste and fresh produce, while the wine pairing is top class. The chef Mirko is a genius both in skill of cooking and explaining each course. I can say in absolute truth that it was the best few hours ever at a dining table. Needless to say I will be back.

While the Shangri La is not the newest hotel it's still one of the very best.  It's in a great location and the service can't be beat.  We especially appreciate the service in the Horizon Club.

The Shangri La represents what all great hotels should be.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,The perfect place in Singapore,
"I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel or its staff. We stayed there in Jan and again in March. The location is good, convenient to shops but not in the city. The lobby is very interesting, the rooms are impeccable, the pool, waterfall and gardens are a delight. The standard of food is excellent, and the elevators do not keep you waiting. The staff are efficient, polite, welcoming,informative, and above all, friendly. We had membership of the Horizon Club which is well worth the money; the food and drinks are mouth-watering, and there are views over the city from the lounge.

All around, it met every expectation.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Nice to Be Back,

The Valley Wing employees supported me in every way they could and gave me strength during a challenging time far away from home.

"This hotel has everything you could want: excellent facilities, attentive staff, attractive rooms. However, it is location challenged. It is a long way from any of the major attractions in Singapore, except perhaps the botanical gardens. There is no shopping or restaurants close by. They have also closed their shop so you can not buy any souvenirs onsite. Orchard Road is a good walk away from the hotel and in the heat and humidity not something you want to do frequently. It seems to be primarily a business hotel catering to meetings so the location may not be a problem for their customers. As tourists, we would have hoped for a hotel closer to the major visitor spots.",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Location challenged,
I've been in this hotel in March with my family and we've got very good service when checking in. The person who helped me very much during our stay was Mr. Swaran Muru.

We began our month-long visit to S.E. Asia with a stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore.  It met and exceeded our expectations.  1. The service was warm and beyond accommodating.  Special shout out to Lorielle and Cory Ann part of the front desk staff the met our needs superbly and consistently.  2. We enjoyed breakfast at Line Buffet every morning.  3.  Book the Garden Rooms if possible.  4. Pool staff (Ramesh especially) are on it.  Be sure to claim loungers early. 5. Orchard Rd. shopping close by; you can walk to it.  One last note; keep a sweater or jacket handy if hanging out in the lobby...they keep it pretty chilled there.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,5 Star Beginning,
Just came back from a wonderful 2 night stay in the Valley Wing. The accommodation was exceptional as was the service provided by all the hotel staff. We were very well looked after with special mention to Iris and Edward C. This was our second stay and not the last. I would highly recommend this hotel.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Exceptional stay!,
"everything is perfect, the greeting, the rooms, the service, the wifi, the people, the gardens, the food, the high tea, the facilities, even the coffee. and then there was the outdated card to open the doors like every other hotel. wiped it when i put it near my phone, lost it by the pool, and my boys one didnt work twice. Why can they not use the smart phone entry. saw it in a cheap hotel in sydney, it works every time. Tap stay. (no it wasnt that bluetooth system i used in hilton either) Look into it and make it really Shangri La. Make me a happy guest, just one little improvement and life for this guest would be seamless... Apart from that , No disappointment here, ENJOY its worth it",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"all and more, except those bloody entry cards",
"It's difficult to know where to start. The room, the lobby, both staff and appearance, waiting staff, food, the room (again) and the grounds. All of these were just about perfect. Breakfast was great, both choice and quality. The only downside of the holiday was that as we were only there for 3 days we didn't get the opportunity to sample all of the breakfast locations available.  In case it sounds like I have rose tinted spectacles, one oddity. There were crumbs on the bedroom floor when we moved in. They were still there when we left. This didn't fit with the rest of our experience but possibly indicates that we can all constantly look to improve.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Valley wing, perfect",

This was not our first stay at one of this group hotel and we were very pleased to see that the standard was consistent to what we remember. Location is ideal as it is only a short walk to Orchard Road shopping area which is excellent. We found a lot of the shops were below ground on several levels and it is quite easy to become disorientated. The breakfast which was included in the room rate was very good and a huge selection was available   We ate in the Italian restaurant on site which was very good and the coffee shop served a good cappuccino. ,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Stopover before holiday,

We love the attention showered on us the minute we stepped into the lobby for the check-in until we reached our rooms. The Garden Wing rooms were of good size with a pool view on the room balcony. We were surrounded by greenery. Yes, I know infinity pool is the fashion. But this is one of the few hotels that has a big swimming pool on the ground floor. The beds were comfortable. Rooms were clean. Breakfast's spread is big. Too bad, my limited capacity couldn't savor everything. The Line was really crowded in the morning for breakfast.

I have also visited the newly renovated Horizon Club and it is fantastic too. The environment, quality of food and drinks, and the services of staffs are fantastic.

Being my first time in singapore and my first time at Shangri-La property it lived up to expectations!  There a few moans on here about refurbishments however you are given ample notice and realistically we were out all day exploring singapore so it didnt bother us.  We were on the 18th floor so got an amazing view of the city. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest MRT which again was quite a nice walk however taxis are plentiful and the average cost to the shopping centre was about 7SGD.  Being a travel agent i will recommend to all my customers and would love to stay again.  Many thanks!!!,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Didn't Dissapoint,

I have been to many nice hotels and along with other Shangri-La's. This felt like an older hotel that is not being up kept. Room was small and just average. There was construction happening while we were there  from 9am-6pm and a lot of drilling so if you were in your room it was not peaceful.  The service made up for the average room as everyone greeted us and helped make our stay great. It was my birthday and the left a cake with 2 Tiger beers in the room which was an awesome surprise.,3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Average,

I have stayed here a few times over the years and usually have nothing but rave reviews. This stay had me in a room where there was a sewer smell in the corridor. They even put a large atomiser in the corridor to try and decrease the smell. There was no note or apology given for the smell. It was a nauseating smell. The breakfast was as good as always.,3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Not as great as previous stays,

The staff in this hotel were exceptionally helpful and friendly. Our room was well designed and the bed was very comfortable. A short (but hot) walk to the shopping on Orchard Road. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus every hour to the shopping and subway station. A convenient way to deal with not being within a close walking distance to the subway. A 10 minute walk to the Botanic Gardens (but you may want to save your energy and take a taxi in the heat). The property is beautifully landscaped with an outdoor pool.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Shangri-la Hotel Singapore,

In more recent times I consistently choose to stay at the Shangri-La in Singapore for business and family holidays. Set on spacious grounds with much greenery it is an ideal setting to hold a business meeting or relax with the family. Whilst the main tower wing has recently been completely renovated I prefer staying in the more tranquil setting of the garden wing. Rooms are generous in size and overlook a small garden. Service levels are consistently high. The gym and wet area is a favourite. Gym is large and well equipped for all types of workouts. The Shangri-La in Singapore remains my first preference when visiting Singapore.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Impressions,

Evening drinks and canapes is very popular while the breakfast caters for all tastes. The Tower wing of the hotel has recently been renovated. We had never walked through the grounds on previous stays but this time we had a thorough look around. Don't miss the Orchid ""house"". Beautifully kept surroundings and larger than we thought. Only problem was we had to change rooms to get one with good bench space for our cases which open out like a book. World Class establishment.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,World Class,

Breakfast was a master class in how to pander to every taste from healthy to hearty to downright gluttony - nothing was left out. In the evenings we ate outside and chose the healthy options menu which was diverse and very tasty.

In December we had a lovely well appointed room with balcony in the Garden Wing which had clearly been updated in the recent past. As ever with this group, the service was impeccable; from the temporary check-in desk( another wing was being upgraded) to the waiting team in the Italian poolside restaurant. On our return in February we were upgraded to the Valley Wing for accommodation but not all the added extras.

"After a cancelled travel in June I came back to Shangri-La Singapore. Due to a mistake during booking (wrong reservation dates), the check in was not as smooth as normally. I totally understand that. But the problem was solved very quickly by the staff. That is why I always come back to Shangri-La Singapore. They make it possible for the customer.  But after renovation, the Horizon Club rooms were reduced so you cannot get an early check in, which is for me bad, as I arrive always in the early morning after a long flight. Of course, you can have the room early, but you pay a 2nd night.For me this is a point that should be looked at from the management. ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Returning to Shangri-La,

The room I was given was large with plenty of space to move around and to work if I wanted to.  Outside there is a resort style pool beside it there is one of the largest hotel gyms that I've been to. (Indoors) Dinner was of a buffet style, with a good selection of western and Asian food selection, seating was inside or out facing the pool.

It's centrally located, easy to get to everything from the hotel, I walked to Orchard street. And mainly took Uber to the museums which was a very reasonable cost. Some minor issues with some of the servers wanting us to order right away but that just may be cultural. Our room was nicely appointed , the bed was a little firm for us but they added a pillow top and it was much softer. The breakfast buffet is amazing, I think they have every nation covered!

"Everything at the Shangri-la is like fine silk. You may not initially appreciate the qualities that provide a depth of character, wonderful drape and impressive texture, but after some experience within this fabric, you begin to understand why the Shangri-la continues to be rated at the top of its class.   The surrounding buildings, rather than give the feeling that one is boxed in within the cosmopolitan city, give the illusion that one is nestled within the palm of the city state, and you can savour all of the near-equator botanicals that come with a deep tropical experience: a dedicated orchid ""pod,"" palms and plumerias abound.

After this we roamed around Orchard Road for a hour and came back to get in our room.  The room was very clean and offered a pool view. All curtains were able to be controlled from the bed by remote. The King Size bed deserved its name and the bath room offered a comfortable size with a well dimensioned shower and enough storage room for two people.  The WiFi connection was high and for free.

No orchids on arrival but not a problem, no ladies toiletries bag, minibar not restocked, continual poor service due to lack of staff afternoon and evening and breakfast was a joke, 5 incorrect orders and eggs sent back 3 times to be cooked properly before finally arriving without other ordered items.  Finally staff extremely rude over the ridiculous flip flop rule at breakfast but ok for hookers to be walking around the lobby and garden area night and day.  They were obviously high class ones!!  What a shame as this was the only place we would stay in Singapore!",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Disappointed with the Valley Wing,
"Nice rooms with elegant decor. Staff, attentive, as always. Breakfast, standard - but not amazing. (Failed the obscure grapefruit juice test - they'd run-out by 10am).

"We had a superb evening in the Lantern bar.  Greeted by Alvin in the lobby and personally taken up before the bar was even open, it seemed nothing was too much trouble.  The staff went to the effort of bringing up cake from downstairs to go with our tea - even though it was not normally served.  Germa then managed to find a table for us the next evening to watch the light show.  We were greeted like old friends firstly by Alvin, then Germa and Anna when we were again escorted up to the Lantern.  We enjoyed a marvellous meal and were looked after for the evening by Julius.  A perfect location on the bay, along with exemplary service.  Cannot praise this beautiful hotel highly enough.",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Lantern Bar fantastic on two days,
We enjoyed pur stay at the lantern bar. Julius Tallano who is one of the staff is very accommodating and polite. He even guided us in ordering one the best and unique drinks that i have ever tasted.

The variety of teas and coffees we're also very impressive and delicious. Fairus and Lotha were very helpful and accommodating.",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Afternoon tea at the Landing Point,
Always used to look forward to and enjoy my stays at the Fullerton Bay Hotel.  Despite the perfect location for Singapore the Fullerton team are not providing 5 star service.  Teamwork looks poor across the various teams be that the kitchen and front office service teams are not working together.  Service is slow and disjointed.  Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight.  After years of being a massive fan of the Fullerton Bay I will not be staying there again and will not be recommending it to friends and family.  Simply put the gap between the price you pay and the service you get are too far apart.,1.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Disappointing and not up to standard,

Still, kudos for offering allium-free options!",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Lovely way to enjoy Marina Bay,
"This property, its staff, service, rooms and facilities are all top notch.  The rooms are spacious and luxurious with large bathrooms that include tubs and showers. The bed is ultra luxe and comfortable. Rooms even have a private balcony.  The breakfast buffet in the morning and the hot entrees are amazing. Service in the breakfast restaurant is also amazing - JJ deserves extra kudos!!  The gym and pool area are on the rooftop and very clean, modern and well maintained. Lobby bar is a great feature for meetings and casual dining.  I simply loved my entire stay!!",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Great gem of a property right on the bay,
"This hotel is now my new go to hotel when in Singapore.  Worth every $$$.  Check-in process was smooth and staff were friendly and approachable.  Room was amazing and had a great view, was unexpectedly large and had everything we wanted.  Location was perfect and it was only a short walk to most places we wanted to visit.

Room was comfortable, bathroom was huge and absolutely no problems at all with our stay.  Will definitely be staying again",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Will stay again without a doubt,
"This is our favorite hotel in Singapore. We go often and we have had a chance to try several of the top hotels. This is by far the best one. The location is slightly off so you always need a car. But if you are staying here, you probably have a car waiting for you anyway. We love the rooms and the rooftop pool. The food at the cafe for breakfast is delicious too.

First class modern hotel with sweeping views of the bay. Great service. Rooms serviced several times a day. Great rooftop pool and bar. Breakfast ok but not as good as the rest of the hotel.

"5 stars  all over, location, service, food and accommodations. Unforgettable family trip. Although flights were long and luggage missed the connecting flight and arrived 2 days later, it was worth it. Enjoyed some Michelin star restaurants plus the nightly light shows at the Marina. Changi airport is very clean and efficient. VAT refunds were efficient. There are no priority ques for business class travelers but there was no need. The facial recognition check in was very fast. Security check is prior to boarding the flight so one must allow sufficient time to board. Singapore should be on everyone's bucket list or must visit list. Caters to all ages and tastes.

"The point of difference with this hotel for me was the level of effort the staff go to for their guests when required.

Thank you!",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Service excels.,
Check in was a breeze and we were greeted to a beautiful room with unobstructed views of Marina Bay. It was a sight to behold.

"We recently spent 3 nights at the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore.  The hotel is located in a beautiful location overlooking Singapore Harbour - would definately recommend spending the extra for the Bay View Rooms.  This really is a 5 star resort.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and a special mention to Oliver from Room Service who seemed to always be there for us, he was extremely attentive and pleasant and made our trip very special.  Would highly recommend this hotel either for a short or long stay.

All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would definitely be back!",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Service & Room Review,
"Back again at this fantastic hotel. We were able to check in fairly early which was appreciated, beautiful rooms and bathrooms and a nice balcony to enjoy. The beds are comfortable with nice bedding. The service is mostly very good, but during breakfast it was at times not so good, things were forgotten, wrong meals delivered and having to wait for a long time to be served. What really disappointed us was that there was no restaurant service by the pool, The Lantern did not open until 5 PM, this was not OK, meaning no drinks or food beeing served until late afternoon. Hope the opening hours will change eventually. At night a great place to be serving drinks with a smile Had a nice afternoon tea our last day. Will absolutely be back",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Back again,
"On my first visit to Singapore in 3 years, I was extremely disappointed in the Fullerton Bay. On Arrival my wife was shown to our room...to discover another guest had already been checked into it. Not an issue, mistakes happen, until the front desk clerk tried to insist she take the room once luggage had been removed.."" The room was cleaned, it is fine"" ...as in cleaned before someone else put their luggage in it and had access. Other than that, the hotel was not really fully open. The rooftop restaurant was closed until 5 pm, and other outlets were usually full, or in the case of The Brasserie, horrible. Again, staff was overall unhelpful and aloof.",2.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,2 star service at 5 star prices,

We had a wonderful Friday evening out here! A great view of the Marina area with a fun music playlist.  The Service was outstanding - nothing was too much trouble (especially considering we had complicated dietary needs on our table). Thanks to Loges who served us for most of the evening. We felt very well looked after. To top it off the food was very good quality indeed!   We haven't been back to the Fullerton Bay for a few years but we were pleased to see the service and food quality has improved considerably since our last visit! Get some live music going on on Friday and Saturday and this would be the perfect venue!   Book in advance if you want to guarantee a table in a good spot for the view.,5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Great Service for food and drinks,
Very nice selection of salty and sweet items and the scones and salty items were restocked free of charge. The sweet items were not.

"Poor customer service from the front desk. The manager Kelly Shum clearly categorises the hotel guests according to the room type. Do not waste your money staying in the Fullerton Bay but rather we recommend the Fullerton Hotel which the staffs there are friendlier and more welcoming. Check-in paperwork took at least 20minutes but to only inform that the room would not be ready anytime soon. The manager used condescending tone to inform that the guests that received their keys before us were staying in different room types despite arriving later than us. From the time we reached to check-in at the front desk to collect the keys, it took 50 minutes. ",1.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Long check-in and Hotel categorises guests according to room types,

I did not get a room with the marina bay view, but the view from my room is still nice enough. Not sure if the guests from the restaurants opposite of my room were able to see into my room or not, so I had the day curtains closed most of the times. The room is very quiet and comfortable, the only time I can hear anything outside the room were when the neighboring guests closed their door loudly.

"Everything went on smoothly. However, in the beginning when i arrived at the hotel, this is my first time driving and i have no idea where to park the car at the reserved area. No valet or hotel staff to assist or guide us where to park.  ",4.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Holding Wedding and Hotel stay,
"Not the first time staying at the hotel. Generally quite good standard of food and service.  At the checkout, I realized that the 50ml belvedere bottle in the room mini bar cost $103.6!!! That implies an over $1000 price tag for a regular bottle! Our fault that my friend drank it without looking at the price list... Please take note",4.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,"Friendly staff, good service but be aware of in-mini bar prices!",
"Be careful if you are seeking to upgrade your rooms, I was told by reservation officer the price I paid in extra for an extra night with an upgrade of room are all inclusive. However upon checkout, did I realise I had to pay and no the price wasn't that, it came as a rude bill shock and unpleasant experience.  La Brasserie wasn't much of a good dining experience either, preferential treatment to other guests.  Have stayed in so many hotels in SG, nice hotel but experience is one of the worst.",2.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Be careful of extra charges,

Had quite an expectation of the hotel. Was quite disappointed with the service rendered throughout the stay. Did not feel like it was worth the price. Breakfast was great though. The view from the room (and also the pool) was also breathtaking.,3.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Just okay,
"The views from the room and every part of the hotel does not disappoint! However, food and service can be improved, especially at Lantern. Suggest to go just for a drink or two and not purchase the pre package. ",3.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Just great for pretty views,
"We booked a family package which has 1 of the benefits stated "" Complimentary extra bed"" but in the end we did not get one though I thought I reserve quite early.  Hence, I would like to comment that if the hotel decide to rollout such package, it should allow all customer who book the package to be able to get the extra bed. Else it defeat the purpose of paying for such package.  And also to take into consideration for kids under 12, eg 11 will be difficult to share bed.",3.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Package,

When checked out i spoke to the fair looking man at counter he gave a better impression at a more professional way. Slow check in and delayed for 1 hr.  Asked to add on bed the fillipino counter lady said will reply but never. The asked again house keeping and no reply.  The restaurant asked for chilli till food finished chilli not served.  Ordered coffee waited long has to ask again.  Shower gel used not top up second day not enough.  Carpet looks dirty. 5 stars hotel i rather chose MBS hotel. Worst the filippino man at the counter knew we were not happy with the checked in.  When i passed through the counter he stared at me not in a friendly way.

"For reference, I stayed in Bay View Room.   1. Great friendly staff  2. Room view goals! Beautiful backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands, and other iconic buildings.  3. Facilities are superb and clean. The jacuzzi tub and the pool also had views of MBS. It was a great time chilling in the tub and just seeing the busy city pass by.  4. The room is nicely decorated and even features a TV in the bathtub. But the room is much smaller than the rooms over at The Fullerton Hotel.  5.

"Fullerton bay hotel was our third hotel in the week!! We were hotel hopping to celebrate our marriage  By far fullerton is  the winner , we were staying at 5 star hotel before coming to Fullerton Bay too but fullerton room by far is the cleanest and very spacious and very luxurious  We staying at Bay view room with balcony that facing mbs  Inside there are huge bathtub with tv and it facing the balcony. The room smell so good , sound proof and the view!!  I cant get enough of the views !! The breakfast was delicious !! We tried the laksa , waffle , scrambled egg set and dimsum! Love it ! The staff are very friendly and professional ! They will great you every time they see you!  We definitely come again !!   Love it ! Very recommended !!!!",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Lovely stay !!,
"I am over the moon about my stay at the Fullerton Bay.  I had a normal room, but it was large, well lit, and had a peaceful balcony overlooking customs house.  Sitting on the sofa on the balcony made all the difference.  Of course, everything else about the hotel, the service, etc is wonderful.   My only complaint is about the breakfast (boring, small portions, cheap ingredients) and the gym (tiny!  only two treadmills, of which one is blocked off due to covid), one bike and one elliptical.  One pulley weight stack, but falling very short of the five star standard.  I loved that the Fullerton Bay is a small hotel, but this was not good.   By contrast the swimming pool saved the day.  It was wide, 25M, and had an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands . I will come back! ",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Lovely hotel for first business trip in many months,
"We stayed in 4 hotels across 1 week and this was by far the ""worst"" hotel experience. We were surprised as we were very much looking forward to our stay, but the entire experience from start to finish was so impersonal and lacking in service. No answer when we called down to the lobby for help, no turn down service, no help with baggage - definitely not what we'd consider a 5 star standard. If you're after a great view of the Marina bay, you could stay here but frankly, there are other phenomenal hotels in Singapore to stay at.",2.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Average stay in Singapore,

The place has nice ambience. You can see MBS view and feel the evening breeze on a good evening. Orders are made via app. It would be better if there are more dessert choices.

Nevertheless,  will definitely be back again.",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,Happy Birthday Celebration ,

"My family went to the Fullerton Bay hotel for my Mom's birthday. It was one of the best hotels we have been to.  Here are a few reasons why:      First,  is that we got free ice cream ( which we loved ) with an ice cream ID/Pass that we could use ever day.  Another reason why we loved this hotel is our room and the hotel's pool was amazing.  Last but not least the hotel people were very welcoming. One example is someone opened the door for us . This was a amazing hotel because firstly we got free ice cream (and a cake for my mom's bday), second of all  we loved the amazing room and the pool, and finally the people are amazing. We love this hotel :D  We will definitely ask our parents to book again",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,,,,My brother and I are writing this on behalf of our parents (we are nine year old twins),

Had a 2D1N stay over the weekend before CB 1.5 - the hotel is still as gorgeous as it is compared to 5 years ago. check in was swift and the room view is so great! Room size is spacious and clean. However i realized there wasn't any care pack in the room but lucky I brought extra mask and sanitizer with me so its fine.  Breakfast next day was in room dining due to the tightening of the measures. Breakfast orders came 98% correct with missing fruits and 1 wrong flavor for the yogurt.

Then Hans, the crepe chef, prepares fresh crepes, plus there are on offer a large number (10?) of delicious small sweet bites which you get to eat as many as you wish.  Our favorite was the mango pudding.  The tiramisu was to die for - almost the best we ever had (but it's hard to beat the northern Italian competitor.)

Very low level of service and attention to guest request.  Guessing people serving mandatory SHN at hotel are NOT considered as guest by staff. A shame as stay at other properties within the group have been great especially as a Platinum member.,1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Poor Service,

"Amazing property, truly luxury experience  My room had an amazing view over Marina Bay, I did like a spacious bathroom and separate living area  Breakfast was absolutely indulgent (I nearly got lost in a breakfast room) The service was up to standards. I really liked when a housekeeper brought a mirror in my room noticing I left my straightener on a table (so it helped me to make my hair properly)  Wish I could come back though it was kind of upsetting to to get any Marriott Bonvoy points from my stay (still such privileges as a room upgrade were provided)",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, perfect location",
"Unacceptable! Shame on you Ritz-Carlton Singapore, forced me to pay FULLY (21-days), in-advance just a night after my stay, which i find it strange since my neighbours mentioned they were not told to pay in advance at all.  Thereafter when the government announced that the SHN will be reduced to 14-days, Ritz-Carlton decided to withold my advance payments and have now blocked my email address, so I have no way of contacting them to retreive my payment,  Shame on you.",1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Shame on you ritz-Carlton Singapore - Front Office,

"Sad!  We were there during school holiday (December) the hotel is doing its reno work everywhere. However, this was not mentioned in their website so it is really dissappointing. Their kids club are close too and we knew about it only during our check-ins.  Checking in is not smooth.   Their club lounge is small and to top up your room to have the lounge access is not worth it!  Their pool is also small! The service can be better I hope.  However the room and view are stunning. The only credit for Ritz Carlton.  ",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Overrated Hotel,

We would also like to commend Eve at the poolside. She was really conscientious in wiping down the deck chairs and offered to take pictures for our family. She was also really good with the kids and they loved interacting with her.   Breakfast was done really well and the food were fresh and delicious. The only disappointment was that they didn't offer any Asian options. Since there are many locals on staycation currently, I would urge the hotel to have a western and Asian option for the guests.

But against all the challenges, the brigade delivered the same amazing experience to be expected of the Ritz. It was a definite respite from all the gloom. Special mention to the ever present and humorous Raj who kept us entertained in between orders, and Regina - sharp as a whip, she was efficient as she was friendly and warm, making sure our plates were never empty and our glasses always filled. What a remarkable team! Thank you once again Ritz-Carlton for delivering yet another wonderful dining experience.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing service the star of Colony,
"Spent my birthday with them before all this COVID19 situation started. It was a pleasant experience as they surprise us while we are away from our room with a birthday cake. Not only that, in the middle of the day, we actually have the housekeeping staff knocking on our door asking us if we need any extra sheets or bottled water. The in-room dining was also awesome! Me and partner were lazy to leave the room so we order in-room dining. They arrived pretty quickly and came quickly as well to clear up for us! 10/10 will go back after this whole COVID situation for a relaxing staycation.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful Birthday Experience,

"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in October 2019.  - Service was exceptional. The check-in process was smooth.  - It was drizzling during the check-in. One of the concierge staff noticed I was carrying a shirt and took a plastic cover to cover the shirt to avoid it getting wet. I was pleasantly surprised by his attentiveness and initiative.   - The pool attendant (I didn't catch his name) was extremely attentive to the needs of the pool users,  - The slight hiccup happened when I had to wait for 45 mins to 1 hour for the room to be ready.   I had previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton and have experienced service standards that were wide. In this recent visit, it was extremely pleasant and I appreciate the good work by the ladies and gentlemen at the hotel.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A Very Pleasant Stay.,

Funny, and coincidentally, enough that those of us who had partners were all free, but our wives were working. I've dined at the restaurant a few times now, but I'm still impressed every time I visit. It certainly deserves the Michelin Star which has been awarded to it for a few years now, and I firmly believe it serves the best Cantonese cuisine in all of Singapore. The food is such a satisfying gastronomic experience, and the service is always impeccable. When you do visit, which you definitely should, I recommend ordering a variety of dim sum and also the Peking Duck.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing Lunch at Summer Pavilion,

I had a 3 day scheduled in october 2019. Due to Pasport issues when flying thru Manilla our group was not able to stay in the hotel. We canceled more than 36 hours prior to check in. The Hotel said they have a 48 hour cancelation policy. Looking on line there is NO such policy listed either on The Hotel site or Expedia. The room rate was to be $500 per night. They kept $1008 of my dollars and would not return the money. I have fought with Expedia and the Hotel for 3 months. I am stil out $1008 for a trip that was canceled properly. I would not use this hotel. BE very wary of using this Ritz Carlton hotel.,1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Stealing money,

When we went to pool just to check out, one of the pool staff gave us a little tour and took picture for us. The room was very nice. Great view with MBS and tiny merlion. We booked club room which was great idea. Food at the club lounge was on point. They had different menu everyday. I didn't not have dinner which I'm very much regret. However there was couple issues. You could hear someone begging door and talking the hole way all night long. Also the other night, house keeper came by around midnight and delivered blanket which we didn't not order. Although we told him that we didn't order it, he asked to open door. It was little bit creepy.  Other than that, we had great time.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Top of the top,

"This property is incredibly well located and the view from the room is incredibly beautiful. The breakfast buffet may be the best I've ever seen, though I didn't sample the restaurants for other meals. My room was delightful - I could have spent hours gazing out the window at the city. My only complaint was the staff at the front desk who didn't seem able to answer my questions or solve the minor problems I had. Perhaps they were a bit inexperienced and just overwhelmed by the activity of the race week-end, but things didn't get done quickly enough, and some of the requests I made took hours to be honoured. A shame... But I would definitely go back.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Magnificent... but some problems with the staff for the Grand Prix week-end,
This was our families first visit to this hotel having stayed frequently at other hotels in the Suntec area of Singapore. Our room was the best that we have enjoyed in this part of singapore and the view from the bathtub each day was amazing as you look over the city. Each day we had an enjoyable breakfast even though the restaurant was busy with it being the holiday season.

We were ready to go to sleep at once so asked him not to bother; however he didn't forget and brought the luggage racks up the next morning at 9:00AM.  Astounding service!

"We visited the Ritz on our honeymoon and were blown away by how nice this property was. The rooms are bright and very large, and the panoramic view of the Marina Bay was absolutely breathtaking. The bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows. The room was quiet and the curtains were fully blackout which made for a great night sleep. And the bathroom was just out of this world, especially with the amazing bathtub overlooking the marina. The lobby is beautiful; it feels very warm and welcoming and the restaurant has a very cool geometric design. The location was very good and walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands.

The hotel staff particularly the Club Lounge staff and the staff on duty by the pool have been excellent and made my stay extremely comfortable and enjoyable.    My fiance was able to visit whilst I was staying, being a busy couple we had not celebrated our engagement properly.  The Ritz Carlton made sure we celebrated by treating us with great attention and class.   We will definately come back to Singapore and we will only stay here.   Thank you!

"I agree with other reviewers - what makes this hotel so special is the staff.  We experienced amazing service with an upgrade, champagne and chocolates as we were both celebrating significant birthdays.  Really, they couldn't do enough for us.  There are newer/more modern 5* hotels in Singapore and we visited a few but the service didn't compare.  Our taxi driver told us that it was her favourite hotel as they treat everyone, no matter who, with such respect....and that's very telling.  Views from the rooms probably the best in Singapore too and the spa is great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful stay.... now back to reality!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fabulous,
"Ritz Carlton Singapore is one of my favorite Ritz.  Previously, I would stay at St. Regis whenever I traveled to Singapore.  But for some reasons, I decided to change hotel and it turned out to be an absolute amazing choice.  I chose the club room option whenever I stayed here.  The staffs are wonderful, specially the club room manager.  I have food allergies and they have been very attentive.  I love the Colony Restaurant for their rich offer of high quality food and beautiful presentations.  The spa service is very good. The swimming pool is large and not very busy.  I enjoyed using the gym here and utilized it every I stayed here.  Great hotel and I am highly recommended this to everyone.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Home from home,

"ALL GREAT! We booked the Club Lounge, as it had food and drinks all day. My mother appreciated the unlimited drinks and various salads, breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, evening cocktails, etc. Best staff ever! The best service we had were: Connie from Colony Restaurant, From the Club Lounge, it was Millen, Jared, Chloe, Bulan, Chuck, and Tina who gave exceptional service at the Club Lounge. The Chefs made such delicious food. The best Hotel we've ever tried!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,WONDERFUL HOTEL,
"Great facility and friendly staff. The only issue I have with this location is that it is a non-participating member of the Marriott Bonvoy rewards program, so your current status means nothing here. No points and no stays will be posted to your account. Website has the facility listed part of the Marriott Bonvoy program. I fail to understand how it is under the Marriott brand and does not participate in the rewards system. I won't stay here again for this reason only. Otherwise, great place to visit.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Not a participating member for rewards,

"Spoiled for choice in Singapore, but this Ritz-Carlton tops most of the competition on two very important things for your business trip: a 24/7, state of the art gym (new equipment, smart lay out, TRX, etc.) and a breakfast and dinner buffet with a strong Asian flavor, not the usual bland world/international buffet. The service is also top notch and Mable distinguished herself at the reception desk and with her attentive follow ups.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Surprisingly excellent gym and buffet,
"We stayed at the 5-star Ritz-Carlton Millenia set in Marina Bay with sweeping Singapore views. We had a warm welcome and the service was excellent. Our deluxe suite had a separate bedroom and living room, a luxurious marble bathroom, and a panoramic view of Marina Bay. Moreover, the spa is a must-try! We spent an entire afternoon relaxing and reviving there, it was divine! Visit my Instagram (IG: @kelledstyle) for more pictures.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful Stay,

After not having stayed here for a few years it was like coming home. The welcome by all staff was so genuinely friendly and welcoming. The Marina Bay rooms are spacious and have incedible views by day and night. The Club Lounge is also great with i think up to five culinary presentations daily. If you are lucky (subject to availability) there is even a complimentary Club Limousine which will take youanywhere in the Marina Bay vicinity. HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE !!!,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Best Hotel, Views & Club Lounge in Singapore",
"Simply amazing. Room is spacious, eventhough the most standard room is already very spacious with good view. Location in Raffles and Suntec area is great for business trip. Staff and management are awesome and helpful. Had emergency matter last minute and the reservation team are willing to help and give refund. This is a true 5 star luxury hotel, they do things to help their guests and make their guests have better days. Unlike many other so-called wannabe luxury hotels like (looking at you Hilton, Mandarin Orchard, Sofitel) who cares more about money and room occupancy than helping their guests. Cannot recommend Ritz Carlton enough if you have some cash spare and you value luxury and true hospitality.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing hotel with amazing staff & management,

"We cant speak highly enough about our four night stay at this hotel. We were given room 1920 and wow what a view of the bay, probably even better at night. The room was extremely spacious, with all mod cons and spotlessly clean. We paid extra for use of the club lounge and it was was worth every penny. The quality of food and drink and all times of the day was superb. We must give a speacial mention to Danny in the club lounge who was always very helpful with his local knowledge of attractions and places to go. But he was always ""lovely"" and had a great sense of humour. We had a fabulous stay and we rocmmend this hotel to everyone.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful time and views,

"Fabulous hotel in a great central location and really friendly helpful staff. No exceptions. Every member of staff I dealt with, from the people on the front and back doors to the resturant and pool staff, were really great. Food was lovely if a little expensive for us Brits as the pound continues to slide.  :( Our room was very large and always spotlessly clean. The hotel is a short walk from ""Gardens by the Bay"" and the start/stop location for the ""hop on/hop off"" bus at SunTech City. I can't speak highly enough of this hotel..",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,1 week holiday in Singapore staying at the Ritz-Carlton,
"Visited the hotel in the end of August for 3 nights and we were staying in king bed Deluxe Marina view room.  I think the extra cost for Marina view is worth it  The location of the hotel is very good all within walking distance of Marina Sands, Gardens of the Bay and Fullerton hotel (many restaurants in the area)  The Spa is really nice, the pool is fantastic, just note that after 5pm there is only shadow in the pool.  We had breakfast in our room rate  which is quite extensive.  The hotel is very big, bit still have more private feeling, especially compared to Marina Bay Sands (which is Las Vegas type of no personal feelings hotel)  The king size bed and the bed sheets quality is fantastic :)  Concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable (sorry forgot her name)",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great view from Marina room,
"We like the hotel especially the hotel room. Even a normal room is in decent size. The staff service was generally good. The check in-staff is quite similar to a robot.We went for breakfast, the queue was so long that it almost reached to the entrance of the hotel. They need more staff in the swimming pool. On sunday, there were only 2 staff for the day serving a busy pool.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Good room size but extremely busy hotel,
"We had a club room on the Marina bay side. Beautiful room with a wonderful view. The Club room on the top floor offered a wonderful service, breakfast, lunch and dinner and everything in between.  The staff are absolutely wonderful. The service impeccable.  Colony restaurant really worth a visit.  I have been lucky enough to visit some of the best hotels in the world, and the service here surpasses all of them.  As far as I am concerned if you are in Singapore, this is the hotel to stay in. One particular staff member who stood out was Antoine in the Club room, he was absolutely fantastic.  Do yourself a favour. Stay here in this most wonderful of Cities. If 6 stars were possible this would have them.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Excellent Hotel, Wonderful stay, Amazing staff, Excellent service",
"This was our fourth time we have stayed at the RC. I was in Singapore for my sons wedding so had booked two rooms for eight days for my wife and self and my family. The service was excellent, especially our room cleaner - Gerald, we were on the 7th floor. This is a luxury hotel with luxury prices, which is fine by me after all you get what you pay for, and believe you me you do get the five star service, nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are excellent and well stocked with soaps, shampoo etc. Some may find the room furnishings a little dated, i.e. a bit 1990ish, However I just love the fact that you get treated so well. My wife and I will be back next year.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent stay,
"We stayed 4 nights here and the location was fantastic. The hotel is lovely and we had a great view from our room over the bay, waking up to this view each morning made it very special.

The pool was nice and not over crowded so was able to get lounges easily. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great location,
"I hope that it is not too late to write this review... :) We stayed at Ritz Carlton Singapore last year. I just looked at photos and videos again when we have visited Singapore last time and just realized that I did not write about you yet !  We really enjoyed our stay there. We booked a Deluxe Marina View room. Our room is on a high floor and the view was so breathtaking !!! The room had a lot of space. The bathroom was so beautiful !   The buffet breakfast was the best with many choices and stations (european, asian...etc).   The staff was professional and polite. Thanks again for giving us such a nice memory in Singapore !

"Work stress was getting to me and since I only get one weekend off a month, I decided to treat myself at the Ritz-Carlton Spa. Why spend the money when I could get a massage for much less? asked the husband. To me, a trip here is not just about the massage. It's about the whole experience - the service, ambience, facilities, thoughtful amenities. When my therapist Fiona heard where I was aching, she suggested I switch to a customised massage which would give her more flexibility to treat my problem areas. Bless her, cos I left the place feeling much better. Would definitely try to book Fiona again.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Rejuvenated again,
Across-the-Board the service was excellent.    The property had a huge convention during my stay and this caused some issues with my room availability. But the team could not have been more accommodating to sort everything.    The main lobby cafe was fine for both a casual business meet as well as a respite from a busy day. The junior-suite was spacious and comfortable.    I highly recommend.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent Service,
"Have stayed here a few times now. I love the rooms, and the staff do every bit extra., I went as they were getting ready for the National parade so things were a little more hectic. The breakfast also is extremely crowded so a lot more people that just the hotel I think.  But the quality of the rooms, the  genuine attention of the staff and the checkin check out process were impeccable. Congrats Ritz. Oh and we loved our massages. ( special shout out to Ritzia.. I think thats her name. Amazing massage)",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,a lovely stop over,
I have visited this hotel at least 10 times or more and each time am so impressed by the staff as well as the hotel itself. I always stay on the Club Floor as the Club is one of the special features I enjoy the most. The rooms are very large and the view of Marina Bay including the Merloin  is spectacular. The food is excellent and I especially enjoy once during the visit the dinner buffet at Colony Restaurant. The pool is quite nice however it can get very busy especially with families in the afternoon. This was the only negative for me. Some of the children were playing wildly and were extremely noisy. Even though the parents did nothing to discourage this I feel the pool staff should intervene as this is the Ritz Carlton and not an amusement park.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Exquisite Hotel,
this is a major chain hotel and you get the bog standard  structure. the rooms are nice bright clean had a marina bay room. disapointed with the sevice by the pool ordered a chicken cesar salad got  a bowl of lettuce sauce 3 croutons and 1 piece of bacon no chicken egg nothing so i asked to speak to the someone.said they would take the cost of the bill .when it came to pay for the bill at the end of my stay the chicken salad was on the bill i said it shouldent be on there the receptions looked and said oh yes it had been taken off so if i had not of checked my bill . so please . just . watch when leaving and paying if they knew the salad was . spose to be removed why try charging for it slightly cocerning in a big major chain hotel like this,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,3 night stay,

There really isn't anything bad to say especially if you have a room with a view of the Marina.

Would definitely stay here again,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel and World Class Service,
I stayed in the ritz for two nights for business . The hotel is a state of art and is amazing from the lobby and all around . The staff at the lobby were very helpful .

We celebrated our 31st Wedding Anniversary and received a cake and bottle of champagne during our stay. The Executive lounge well worth it, excellent service, food and champagne throughout the day. At present we live in Melbourne and have never received such excellent service or food. We would most certainly stay here again on our way back to Europe.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful Stay,
"My mum and I spent two nights at the Ritz Carlton and the service was outstanding. Every staff member was friendly and went out of their way to help, especially Nidhi at Customer Relations who took a good 10-15 minutes annotating a map of Singapore with all the things to know (I think we made it through almost everything too!).   The drinks at the bar downstairs were wonderful and the rooms were flawless. The view was spectacular, the bedding so comfortable, bath luxurious and everything was super clean.   Thank you so much to everyone we encountered during our stay you made it very memorable.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful Stay,
"Initially had a very bad first day which included transportation and check in at the hotel.

Kudos and thank you to the team at Colony !  Mahesh, guest relations supervisor, deserves a mention as he immediately prepared a beautiful bouquet of flowers after knowing that it's my mother's birthday!

"I have stayed here twice in the last month, once with my family and once on my own. The rooms are beautiful, the linens goregeous and the Asprey toiletries are perfect. The pool is great if you like to do laps, and ideal for the kids to have fun. Both times we have had the club facility on the 32 nd floor. Danny, Chuck, Bing, Michelle and all the team could not have done more to make our stay super comfortable. Our daughter with Coeliac was looked after beautifully and generally the food is absolutely incredible. As a lone lady traveller, I could not have felt more at home which is such a credit to the hotel.

"I first stayed in this hotel 20 years ago, when it was cutting edge. Of course a lot has evolved since then, and I was a little apprehensive as to how the rooms would fare against modern standards. No need to worry about service - this remains top class. The good news is the RC has evolved with the times, and it is a great experience in room as well as in the catered areas of the hotel. I was attending a conference at the Mandarin, which is easily walked to from the RC, and the RC lacked nothing in ambience. Singapore has so many great hotels, and maybe my history here makes me biased, but in my opinion, the RC is still the one when it comes to top class hotels in SG.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Still the one ...,
"Have been to many high end hotels and this one was amazing. Every single staff went out of their way to say hi and help in anyway they could. Too many places now where people pass the buck, have the attitude it isn't their job. No staff at this hotel in any area looked the other way. They were there to assist at every circumstance. Shows the have a great manager. Hotel room was gorgeous with huge floor to ceiling windows. The shower pressure was great. Didn't want to leave our room!  Central to everything.

I recommend getting one of the free flow Beverage packages! ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,5 Star Excellence ,
"We had booked a room with a view of the bay. When we arrived our room was not ready. We did not mind waiting however after 10 minutes the staff told us that they had upgraded us to a suite.

"My husband, our one year old along with both our parents stayed at this wonderful hotel for 7 days whilst on holiday in Singapore.  From the moment we stepped foot in the hotel, we were treated with kindness, respect & such warmth. The staff go above & beyond to ensure your stay is comfortable, memorable & fun. Nothing is too much work or off limits. They ensure that they put the customer first on all accounts & are particularly welcoming to seniors in wheelchairs & babies needs.  The rooms are clean & spacious & the bath and blinds are exceptional.  Chef Anthony deserves a special mention for his kindness to us all, but in particular our baby boy (also named Anthony).  From us all, thank you Ritz Carlton Millenia!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Absolutely amazing hotel & brilliant staff!,

And the guy at Colony (sorry that i cannot remember his name) are great at their seevice.  Although the hotel is crowded during Chinese New Year Day.

"I have been to Singapore a number of times and being at the Ritz in Singapore is like coming home. I used to stay in the Club lounge level. The team members and their efforts making the difference to other luxury hotels. The head of the Club lounge is Sheila - Great hospitaliy and always welcoming and supporting my wishes. I have had a marina bay view which is wonderful. Just sitting in the room and appreciate the view ...  Rooms are spacious and bath tub with window to overlook the marina. Big rooms in comparison to other hotels in Singapore. Walking distance to the Sands hotel (infinity pool and great bar, casino etc.) You can use the club lounge for meetings as well and is a perfect location to meet business partners and colleagues.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very good hotel and really top service and hospitality at the club lounge level,
"The Club Level offers luxury and personal choice.  The staff led by Sheila and Chuck ensured all your needs were met.  In saying this it should be noted that all staff from the check-in, dining experience and the housekeeping were friendly and highly skilled in their roles. The pool area offered an oasis from the hectic pace of Singapore. Confirmation of this amazing experience was in meeting numerous travellers, families and couples, who come back every year to the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Personalised Excellence,
"Once again i returned to the fabulous Ritz Carlton Hotel in Singapore. This time to celebrate my mothers 80th birthday. The wonderful ,friendly ,kind staff , lead by Sheila and Chuck went beyond my expectations to ensure my mother had the most memorable stay. From organising our room close to the lifts, providing a beautiful birthday cake and banner to everyday making us feel so welcome and special. The rooms are so spacious and clean and the food in the entire hotel is exemplary!!! I will not be staying anywhere else when I return to Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,EXEMPLARY !!,
"I had hi tea buffet with my girlfriends and thumbs up for the service crews! They are fully attentive, highly professional, warm and welcoming! I would like to specially compliment the service staff, Dunstan. He is knowledgeable, gave us an introduction of the various tea flavors, and constantly checking if we needed extra top up of our drinks and if we needed any further assistance! We felt so comfortable and welcoming that we continue to stay on after hi tea and ordered wine. Highly recommend to visit Chihuly Lounge! The staff are well mannered, well trained and it was a superb dining experience for my galfriends and myself!! ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent service at Chihuly Lounge ,

Beautiful property with amazing staff especially Diana from Guest Relations. The rooms are so amazing that it makes staying at any other hotels miserable. Lunch buffet at Colony was also very delicious and extensive. Regret not staying in a Club room!,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing Stay,
"We stayed at five luxury hotels in Singapore and this is one of the best. The Club premium is so well worth it. Marina views, complimentary food and alcohol virtually all day. Exceptional service to international standards. Bedrooms very well equipped, everything thought of, mood lighting, looking over Marina Bay from your bath. Most comfortable beds in Singapore. Food and amenities superb. Special thanks to Chuck and Benjamin in the club lounge for making us feel extremely comfortable and never letting our glass be empty!!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"MBS could learn a lot from the efficient, excellent service in this hotel",
"I had an amazing 3 day stay at the RC Millenia a week ago.  I'm looking for a new go to hotel now that my usual haunt was taken over by Accor for my 2-3 trips per year to Singapore.  I have nothing but good things to say about the RC.  The staff was incredibly attentive and professional, yet very friendly.  My suite was gorgeous and well appointed with an amazing view of MBS.  The buffet breakfast was among the top 5 that I've ever had in Asia, and nothing tops an Asian buffet.  I forgot my glasses in the restaurant one day, and they were returned to me on a towel elephant.  How fun and whimsical!  I will definitely be back.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Outstanding hotel in Singapore,
"Just what you would expect from a hotel of this standing. Excellent. Good location, easy walk into town. Staff were very accommodating and arranged a late checkout without fuss. If I was *forced* to pick something to fault it was that the staff were a little too invasive at times. That's a very personal thing - I know some people like being fussed over (and expect it at this price point).",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Brilliant view, excellent room and facilities.",
"The staff here do go out of their way to help. The rooms are large and very comfortable. I found it unfortunate that the TV is mounted in such a way that viewing it from the bed causes a crick in the neck. The TV also experienced frequent glitches when no picture was visible. Sound proofing could be better - a child screaming nearby was clearly audible, as was what sounded like a stampeding herd of horses on the floor above.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very helpful staff,
Crowded check in facilities. Very friendly service from all staff. Nice club facilities with good local and western snacks. Large room and very comfortable.  Nice view of the harbor.  Highly recommended.,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great Ritz with excellent svc but aging facilities,
"Staff at this hotel have been trained to be pleasant, friendly and attentive. I have to say it. Everyone was so nice. Everyone was so helpful. Both sides of the hotel give excellent views of the city and it is centrally located/walking distance to shopping malls, the Singapore Eye, subway station, Gardens By The Bay and the huge Marina Bay Sands and attendant shopping malls. One thing though if eating at the amazing Colony Restaurant don't expect a free table on arrival, make sure you book. This amazing buffet restaurant was very difficult to get a meal in. Breakfast in the Colony was an extravagant experience and possibly alone worth the cost of staying at The Ritz.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,You're Made to Feel at Home Straight Away,
I spent last 2 days in Singapore in the Ritz Carlton .. I know it is a 5 star hotel .. but for that Ritz Carlton .. it is a 7 star .. the service .. the environment.. the rooms .. the view .. every single thing was perfect.. the breakfast is wonderful..  the most important part is the staff and how friendly and supportive.. I can list all of them here .. but believe me they all deserve the appreciation,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"We will come back, Enshalla",
"I've been a frequent visitor to Summer Pavilion at the Ritz Carlton and have hardly patronized any other F&B outlets within the hotel until a recent visit to Chihuly Lounge.   I was warmly welcomed by Assistant Manager, Sandrine Qu, who was ready to give her recommendations for food and drinks, all of which were very good. As I was by myself on a recent visit, she made me feel really at home and not alone at all.   The very talented Daniel Park was also really entertaining and was ready to take on any songs requests.  I now have another go to place at the Ritz Carlton, thanks to the wonderful team at Chihuly Lounge. Keep up the good work!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Impeccable service and beautiful music at Chihuly Lounge,
"We spent 5 days at the hotel at the end of November.  It is an exceptional hotel, but what makes it super special is the staff.  Absolutely no request was too much and the staff/concierges anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them!   The hotel provides limo service for local trips (loved that!), and made our stay so special we will stay there again the next time we visit the city.  Full marks.  Well done!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Stellar Hotel ~ home from home,
"One of the top 5 hotels in Singapore, service is always spot on and the rooms are well maintained. The location is good down by the bay area, casino is close by as are alot of food options. City centre is about a 5 to 10 min cab ride depending on traffic. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,High standard hotel,
"I was in Singapore for the Marathon and saw that the Ritz was within easy walking distance (3 minutes) of the start-finish, and so impulsively moved hotels to make my already hard day a lot easier. Was it worth it?  In this instance, yes it was. It is the Ritz, after all, so the hotel itself starts at pretty fantastic. We booked a club room with a spectacular view of Marina Bay.  The club lounge is an all day experience in being pampered, both by the service and by the many delicacies on offer all day long.  It is Ritz, so it is also fairly expensive. If you want to splurge, and to be treated like royalty from arrival to departure, then this is your place.  There are, however, other choices around Marina Bay that are also excellent stays that you can have for half as much.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Service,
I stopped in the Chihuly Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore for a cocktail and what a place!  They offer a variety of drinks and assorted beverages that will knock your socks off!  Sandrine Qu was in the lounge and was most helpful.  She took the time to show us some of the specialty drinks that they offer.  It added a touch of class that was a step above.  They also have musical sensation Daniel Park playing live music almost every night.  Great place for drinks with friends or a romantic night out with that special someone.  Stop by this place while in Singapore... you won't regret it.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,So I'm walking by the Ritz-Carlton...,
"We stayed there for 4 nights but really I would not recommend it.  The view from our bedroom was amazing but the hotel is mean.  I used the pool and wanted  5 minutes in the sauna, they wanted to charge me 30 dollars.  We had 2 bowls of ice-cream , 3 very same balls for again 30 dollars, the ice cream was not even amazing and we had to ask for water.  They do not go the extra miles to please you.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Good location but not great,
"This hotel is absolutely fantastic! From the moment we arrived and met Rachel in guest relations and Tina at the club lounge we knew the service here was going to be top notch.  Our upgrade to a suite was unexpected but so very appreciated.  The room amenities and views are just stunning.  I took a bath in the gorgeous tub almost immediately.  From the club room food and beverage delights, little surprises left in our room, use of the club car, and genuine smiles from staff it is such a pleasure to stay here. We will be back for sure. Best RC we have stayed at yet!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Top of the Line Hotel and Service!,
"The rooms are worn and dated. No USB ports, grubby furniture, no coffee maker (which is now very much standard in five star hotels globally), smoking floors (again basically phased out globally)  but I guess the Ritz needs to cater to ill mannered guests from the Middle Kingdom.   As a frequent corporate client for a decade I was shocked to check in at midnight and found my king size booking was changed to a twin. No offer for an upgrade but I could have a king sized bed in smoking room. Yeah, no thanks. Like sleeping in camp beds and they did smell much better either. Must be a lot of bed wetter here.  This my last stay at the Ritz Sing. You are a stain on the global franchise. Up Your Game ",1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,In major need of a face lift ,
"We checked into Ritz Singapore as just another Ritz. But Daniel Park's live music at the bar made a difference. One of the best music performance and voice we've heard for years and full of emotions too.   Also don't forget to look for Sandrine, manager at the bar, she WILL take care of you as a family, as a great friend.   Sandrine and Daniel made the overall experience an unforgettable one.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great music and great experience,
"Great location. Make sure you ask a room with a view on Marina Bay, for the view, in particular at night.  Service is impeccable, everything is super clean and the food is good and a bit expensive.  Breakfasts are very elaborate and can be a culinary experience by themselves.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Spectacular in all aspects!,
"in fact, I have been staying at this hotel for a long time and the service and comfort from the past until now has never changed, therefore I highly recommend this hotel as one of the places that can be observed with luxurious and classy super classes because I feel the service provided by workers here especially I would like to thank the assistant front office manager Mr. Evan Chiang and his team for giving me something good for me once again I highly recommend this hotel as one of the best hotels in the city enjoy",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,One of the best in this town,
"Went for an buffet Dinner and I must say that looking at the buffet spread, it's was highly impressive. You can find almost every famous international cuisine dish in the buffet and at the same time local dishes have not been neglected. The cheese and dessert section needs a special mention. Overall a great buffet experience.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Buffet Dinner,
Its my first time to stay in Ritz Carlton Singapore. The place is nice and really one the best hotels. Unfortunately it will be the last also as the front desk staff was quite rude and not accomodating. Very frustating. ,1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Unfriendly Front desk staff,
"Everything about this hotel screams five stars from the rooms to the staff and the locations. However, Fatyn really made our stay here unforgettable with her professionalism and outstanding service. We mentioned that we were staying here as part of our honeymoon and Fatyn was able to get us a room near the top, which was much appreciated. She wanted to find us a marina view room but they were fully booked and we were already grateful as we didn't expect any levels of upgrade. She also sent us a plate of desserts and chocolates along with a hand written card which really brought our experience over the top. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Singapore and I hope they are fortunate enough to meet Fatyn",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,World class view with servie to match!,
My room facing marina bay. The room ia all set with good decoration but need some voice protection from outside walkway. I experienced of RC Hongkok which it was quite better. BF is good but no view it should be high floored facing marina bay. The hotel manager prepared a birthday stuff with it is warm welcome us.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Good view of marina bay,
"Gorgeous grand dame hotel with exemplary service. Rooms and bath are beautifully appointed, but certain areas (frayed rug and towels) are showing their age. If you are spending most of your time at the hotel (staycation here), then a Club room is well worth the upgrade, with meals and drinks all day in a beautiful venue. Note, children are not allowed in the Club after 6pm. But kid friendly pool, Ritz kids welcome package, and play room kept my daughter busy. We also appreciated an early check-in and late check-out to maximize our stay.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Top notch service at an elegant hotel,
"I cannot say enough good things about this hotel!  Our harbor view room on the club level was spacious, immaculately clean and we enjoyed that it was freshened several times during the day.  The A/C was adjustable to the level of coolness we prefer (something we always look for in hotel reviews). The club level lounge was fantastic.  Wonderful selection of food, quiet, not crowded, and attentive, helpful staff.  In particular, Tina and Ben were amazing...both went above and beyond to make our stay fabulous.  This is truly a 5 Star property in every possible way.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Perfect Stay,
"On the 5th October we had the pleasure of having high tea in the Chihuly Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton for a birthday celebration. The surroundings were impressive and the piano player in the background made this a special occasion. The 8-course high tea was of impeccable quality and the entire experience was made even more special by the fabulous Sandrine Qu and her team (Yun, Kim, Delwyn, and Zoey). They could not have been more attentive and really made us want to return to the Ritz-Carlton on our next visit to Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,High Tea at the Ritz-Carlton,

"We have been through Changi so many times and never stopper to see the City we were wowed. The hotel was big well furnished but we really are not big hotel people it makes you feel like you are still at work for some reason but that said it was great the people wonderfully hospitable, fun ,entertaining, and could not do enough to make sure we were welcomed.

"Room was at level 32 facing MBS, hands down the best view of Singapore's city(compared to many of the other hotels situated at Marina). Nothing fancy but still classy and comfortable. Club food doesn't have much variety but tastes ok. Professional and friendly staffs. Iconic window by the bathtub. The only thing missing will be.. a new in-room speaker! Love the lobby scent too, brought me back to the time I stayed at Ritz London hahaha",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Best view,

Big bath and shower were great.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Fantastic and adequate luxe hotel, rooms and service",
We stayed for two short nights recently and I have to say that I can not tell you enough how wonderful this hotel truly is.  It is not just the iconic location with by far the best view in Singapore but the people from the top down who make this hotel what it is. Nothing is too much trouble.  The food is just outstanding. The Chinese Michelin star restaurant was the best ever. My tip - upgrade to the executive club. French champagne all day. Food. It pretty much makes it an all inclusive hotel.  The breakfast buffet was ridiculous. Excellent price too.  The staff outstanding from the door to every outlet. The bed super comfortable with an amazing view.  I will never stay anywhere else in Singapore.  ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Can I give it ten stars?,

Thanks Ritz for an enjoyable stay in Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great Stay,
"Amazing hotel and staff. The facilities (pool, spa, and bars) are top of the line. Do not skip the epic breakfast buffet they offer in the main lobby. You'll have to try every food station.

"Stayed in the Ritz Carlton for a night and took the room facing the Marina Reservoir. The view was simply awesome. The room was v big and the bathroom was simply out of this world.

Check in was fast and I have nothing but praise for Ritz Carlton!",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,View at its best,

Recently stayed there with my family for 6 nights and had a great time. I have stayed in all the hotels around Marina Square now and would definitely consider the Ritz to be the best.

I would definitely choose to stay there again.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful hotel,

My first night, I had the buffet dinner at Colony, and it was truly the best buffet I have ever had in my entire life - the selection seems to be endless. Breakfast was amazing too, my favourite has to be the chicken curry and paratha! I highly recommend this hotel to business and leisure travellers alike.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,The definition of hospitality,
"This was my first time staying at this hotel.  While I am a Gold member of Marriott/Ritz Carlton Rewards, the hotel does not participate in the program.  So no status recognition.  However, they treated me very well. My room was very modern and clean.  A/C worked very well.  There was a nice gift waiting for me upon my arrival and the room service and bar were great.  Hotel staff smiled and everything that I requested was delivered very quickly with no issues.  I generally stay at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore, but this will be my new hotel of choice.  Status or no status, when a hotel has great leadership and strives to exceed every guest's expectations - that is the very definition of service.  Very well done.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Amazing Hotel, Excellent Staff and Wonderful Service",
"Besides of the convenient location, the great view to the bay, and the luxurious facility, I'd say the most beautiful view of Ritz-Carlton Millenia is their great staffs and their hospitality to the guests. My family truly felt Ritz-Carlton Millenia was a home away from home during our stay. Everyone was so nice and the conversations with your staff, wherever in the lobby, the restaurant, or the swimming pool, were not just saying hello/good day. We can feel they did care about you, your experience with the hotel, and even more your impression on Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A home away from home,

You have the buffet in the colonies and that means food from the globe. You don't really have to eat for the rest of the day should you choose that .

And the staff in the kitchen try to help too although it is difficult to explain a century old egg........",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,If you want to pamper yourself....,

They always treat me/us with the best service possible. A special shoutout to Kent Ang, Chef Joeson Tiong, Bernard and Hui Peng. Chef Joeson personally came to speak to us during the meal and insisted that dessert is on the house. And Kent picked up on something we mentioned about the art in the hotel, and the following week he mailed to my home an envelope with a letter and a collection of Ritz Carlton bookmarks each with a special artpiece printed on it. Ritz always gets top marks for guest recognition and service. Look forward to another stay there this July.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Always treated like a VIP here,

Will definitely dine at Colony again!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Awesome customer service!,

"Invited by friends to celebrate a special occasion. Expensive high teas are not on my agenda. I would recommend this for a special occasion, because it was memorable. And way better than others I've been to. The service was excellent. The courses were superbly plated with explanations. And the tea had an excellent variety of bites, not overloaded with just the sweet stuff. Take some advice when choosing your tea. Mine became a tad bitter and I wasn't sure I could change it. The others all loved their choices. A truly lovely treat. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A rare relaxing moment ,
"Excellent hotel, great rooms and views, 1st class restaurants and bar areas, very friendly and efficient staff.

I would recommend it very highly. A wonderful experience. Way better, in my view, than any Orchard Road locations.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Customer couples event,
Our family had a very enjoyable staycation over our daughter's sixth birthday. It was our first ever staycation and we didn't know how it would go. We choose the Ritz Kids Night Safari and a marina bay view room. All of us especially our daughter really relished the camping experience. The staff were courteous and helpful throughout our stay. Special mention to Nivedha (sorry if we got your spelling wrong) for taking special care of us.  Of course the bill at the end of this wonderful experience wasn't for the faint hearted...   The breakfast was completely off the charts!! Cant wait to go back..,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Thoroughly Enjoyable Staycation!!,
"We recently stayed Club Level at the Ritz Carlton at the end of a month long holiday in South East Asia to celebrate a big birthday.  The service was world-class, absolutely outstanding.  The views of the Marina and City, as said before by previous reviewers, are arguably the best you can get, looking directly at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Gardens of the Bay, etc, etc.  We would specifically like to thank Sheila, the Club Manager and Ryan, Club Concierge, Chef Sundar and all the rest of the Club staff who looked after us.  They are unfailingly attentive and courteous, and the food and beverage offering of the Club is quite simply superb.  We cannot recommend staying at the Ritz Carlton in a Club level room highly enough.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Superb Club Level Experience,
"Booked Ritz Carlton MIllenia Sg for a family staycation ....booked more than 1 room ...and we managed to get ALL within the same floor! All thanks to Jolynn Chia , the reception service agent for the day on duty..she did an EXCELLENT job in accommodating our request. The stay was excellent ..rooms were very clean and spacious...will be back again soon!  Just a small feedback..the evening turn down service was not up to par as the person who was doing it that day did not come in to do it and did not even asked if we wanted a turn down service..perhaps this area can be improved. :)  Overall..a excellent stay ...

"My visit to Singapore was too short. I spent few days there. I have searched for places I could visit in this short period of time before visiting Singapore. I found all I needed at the Ritz-Carlton, where I had a wonderful time, good food, wide room and a beautiful view of the bay. I enjoyed the great panoramic room view as it was my request. It has another amazing view by a hexagon window in the bathrooms. I have chosen the Ritz precisely because of its excellent location, which overlooks the bay and  Marina bay sand hotel which has a great shape, so that I can not miss the beauty of the wonderful view. I got the best treatment from all the staff. I enjoyed the stay ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A great panoramic room view ,
"Completed awed by the service provided by the staff. How did they even know my last name everywhere I went? Such a mystery but definitely a delight to experience the degree of care. Kudos to Laura who sorted out my executive lounge access confusion with Agoda. Yes, executive lounge access is a ""very good to have"" as it has a very good view of the marina bay front. Not withstanding its good spread of food. The room was pretty huge with fantastic view of marina bay front. Super big bathroom with a walk in wardrobe. Laura even gave me a handwritten thank you note for the stay. some words which I picked out, ""thank you for letting us stay with you"". It's uniquely not the opposite. Wow! Will definitely choose them for our next weekend staycation.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Excellence in every single way.

Highly recommend ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Easter Sunday Brunch,
Everything was absolutely perfect! All the staff were extremely polite and helpful! The hotel areas and room were very cleaned. The food (breakfast and dinner) were delicious.  They offered us a room upgrade since it was our honeymoon!  Just a minor recommendation: it should be more convenient for us to ammend the opening hours of the michellen star-restaurant. 9.45 for the last order is a bit early for some european countries. ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing!,
From the moment you arrive until the minute you leave you are made to feel special because the staff are so attentive but not in an 'in your face' way.  Rooms are large and very comfortable.  Location is stunning especially if you get a marina facing room.  Food is excellent catering for a very wide range of tastes.  The special drinks package is exceptionally good value for money.  Well done everyone at the Ritz-Carlton,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,What a great hotel,
"The level of personalised service in such a large hotel was very impressive.  Check in was speedy but flawless, my bags arrived shortly after I did!  I was in the basic room but it was enormous, with proper sofa and arm chairs, a huge desk with power for pretty much every variation of a standard plug.  The Nespresso machine was appreciated too!  The Bathroom was very impressive with nice toiletries that included a comb, toothbrush and loofa - all the little things you can't live without if you forget them!  The pool was also beautiful, which I wasn't expecting in such a business orientated location",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A great business hotel,
"It is certain that this is not a cheap hotel at ALL.  However the rooms are amazing - large and comfortable. The staff could not be more responsive and attentative.

This has become our hotel of choice in Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,All Round Excellance,
"It is my sincere opinion, one of the best Singapore have to offer. Located at the fringe of the busy activity zone, one can get to appreciate the view of modern cosmopolitan Singapore Marine Bay. Book yourself, soak in the long bath, and admire the scenery. When one is here, one must not pass up the chance to savour the restaurant they called Colony.

I have a chance to have an afternoon tea at Chihuly Lounge again and George is doing is job as always. I feel like seeing old friends here.   The in room dining and the room are still great.

Each room, had an extremely comfy bed, sofa, robes and slippers and Luxuary toiletries.   The hotel is in a great location so you can walk to many near by attractions. Breakfast! Where do I start? By far the best breakfast I have eaten in all the hotels I have been to. The variety is endless. Literally different rooms or areas for different cuisines. They have everything!  If you like the finer things in life, then stay here if you are in Singapore. Could not recommend this hotel enough. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,What a wonderful hotel! ,

"I stayed a couple of nights on business using Marriott Destination Club points (timeshare points).  I booked the cheapest room but got an upgrade to a huge suite with a fantastic view.  My conference was at the Marina Bay Sands which was an easy walk across the Helix bridge or a quick and inexpensive Uber ride.  Service was impeccable, and the room was beautiful.  I also enjoyed the pool area which is very tranquil and peaceful, even though it's in the middle of a bustling city.  Promenade MRT (subway) stop was close by as well, so there was easy access around the city.  I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to be spoiled rotten in Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fantastic upgrade!,

The room was spacious and very well appointed and was everything we had hoped for. Loved the fantastic views from our windows - even when in the bath. If looking for a quick snack, you can't go far wrong with the chicken satay which was delicious.  My only regret is that we didn't manage to enjoy one of their afternoon teas which looked fantastic.  Would not hesitate to recommend",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent Stay,
I've been coming here for almost 15 years and this place continues to disappoint.   I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with it but it just lacks a certain something   I don't choose to stay here I'm always being booked by my work   compared to the other hotels in Singapore it's a let down   it doesn't have a rewards system the rooms lack soul and it's perched out on the edge of Singapore.   And it's lobby bar is pants.    Give me the MO next door any day of the week ,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Always a let down. ,
The Ritz Carlton is an icon in Singapore. The location and customer service is wonderful. The breakfast I think it is one of the best in Singapore. You can walk to many malls and see the harbor from your window. If you look closer at the hotel you will see signs of old age. The wood is worn-out and the gym is not that impressive. The lefts are little slower but you won't notice it is unless there are many people. Over all you can not go wrong with this hotel.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,One of the best hotels in Singapre,
"Very impressive and enjoyable stay over 4 nights. Helpful staff, in particular, Lavin, went out of his way to explain everything we needed to know about the sites to see, the room and easy ways of getting to various places of interest.

"I stayed 4 nights in this hotel booking a suite with marina bay  views. The room was ok light and airy and sparcely decorated. The only thing that I must criticize was the fact that a luxurious hotel like this has not staff who speak spanish in the reception or attending the phone calls. In addition, the breakfast menu has to improve, for example the fruit juices are not natural  simply package juices what is not the charactic from a 5 star hotel and the quality of the pastry products are medium.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,opinion HOTEL RITZ CARLTON SINGAPORE,
"Acknowledging that we arrived late and left early, so the review is based on a short experience - it was bizarre. The club lounge was unwelcoming - despite being told we could still get something to eat there at check-in in our suite, we couldn't and we felt we were incredibly lucky to even get a drink. So, back to our room for room service - when we called we were put on hold and offered a call back that never came. When we rang again 20 minutes later - there was an almighty argument going on and we could hear it all - we even checked if the lady on the phone was ok. Very slow service. But it arrived with a smile and professional service in the room. Check out downstairs was good and efficient. Given the price of a suite and a club room - this stay was absolutely not worth it.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Strange stay ....,
"Our room was high up in the sky on the 25th floor with the beauty of Singapore laid out before us.  The location is perfect for exploring the Marina Bay area and gardens.  A beautiful hotel.

There is a lot of competition for hotels in Singapore, but this is definitely up there with the best.  We enjoyed our stay enormously.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Simply Perfect,

The check-in staff, Ms. Felicia Ho, was very efficient and not only upgraded our room but also assigned us to a room which had a dramatic view of the Marina Bay area and also ensured that we had a ring-side view of the fireworks display.

This hotel is Ritz Carlton standard what I mean is service are excellent fast and friendly. The room are quite big and of course nice. 2 times room cleaning everyday. However this hotel are not participate in Ritz Carlton membership program. Sauna and Jacuzzi also need to pay additional SGD35 which I think they shall give it as complementary facilities since hotel room charge already quite high.  Anyway overall staying here are recommended.,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Good Hotel, Excellent service",
"This hotel is very good, from arrival through to food and all staff  I have nothing but praise. Club level the very best I have ever experienced anywhere. The gym and pool fantastic and up to date, towels, water, fruit in gym all good. I would like to kidnap the chefs who looked after us in the club lounge as the food they prepared for us in the mornings to order was done with care and kindness - right up to personally delivering to table on occasion.  The views from hotel (and bath) worth the stay on their own. Who ever runs this place deserves what they are paying them and some. Good job.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Will come back,
"We recently stayed at the Ritz Carlton while in Singapore for a few days. This is by far one of the best if not the best hotel we have stayed in.   The service upon arrival had already set up the kind of high expectations of service we were going to receive. We were lucky enough to have a room with a stunning view of Marina Bay which you could just gaze at the whole day.   We went out a few hours and when we came back to our room, our slippers had been put next to the bed and the room made up for sleeping along with a little note from front desk thanking us for staying.   We were genuinely sad we had to leave the next day as the ritz makes you feel pretty special.   We will definitely be back again as well as staying at other ritz!

When they were to return home , went to concierge desk to ask for 2 complimentary parking tickets but was rejected. Do note that I have spent $300 on drinks alone in the lounge and my room cost a bomb , nightly $810.  2) Went to Ritz club on the highest floor , and witness them chasing out a Korean couple with kids after 6pm but have to say that the staff ask them out politely. Not very good impression for a person who have kids like me.  3) The other area of service like front desk , check in/out, housekeeping etc are impressive though",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Disappointed with Concierge Service,

The rooms are splendid, as they are not standard, they are well appointed, and the room service is superb. The rooms though do need updating as they are starting to show some ages, but are far from tatty etc.  The one reservation is that to use the spa next to the pool which is the only place to change you have to pay s$35 ! but it is no issue as you can change in your room if you dont feel that you can justify the charge.

"This was a last minute booking taken to extend our Singapore holiday and no regrets at all.From the very beginning we felt so special with the lovely doorman who led us and waited, for check-in.  Our room was a suite-glorious views of the bay even from the bath. Beautiful scented toiletries and automatic blinds are just some of the perfect touches we won't forget about the Ritz Carlton.We would absolutely love to return here.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Our stay was an amazing experience!,
"I enjoyed a weekend at this hotel enroute to business travel to Malaysia.  The hotel is on the pricey side, but on par with similar properties in the Marina Bay area.  Room accomodations are top notch, no complaints at all.  Breakfast buffet is Incredible, but plan to take it slowly to enjoy it and get your money worth.  Location is great, right on Marina Bay and walking distance to nearby hotels, shopping and attractions.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Not notch, very classy!",
"This hotel is full of little details and surprises!  The rooms are very spacious and clean, te food is great and the restaurant is very pretty! There is not a lot of crowd (like most of the other hotels in Singapur) and everything seems to be really new or taken care of.  Service is really good and the people that work here are really really nice and always smiling and willing to help you!   Totally worth it! Won't stay anywhere else in Singapore! ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very special and full of details! ,
"Ritz Carlton is always my no.1 choice for hotel. Never get disappointed with the Ritz. Although the RC in Singapore is not brand new, i still had a great time there. Spacious room with excellent customer service. Love the bath tub and the window (great spot to take a photo!)  The most impressive thing was.. I previously posted a photo on my personal Instagram account. And the Social Media team in RC sent me a lovely card and printed out my photo (framed). That little surprise made my day! Now my boyfriend has something to put on his desk haha!  In addition, I would like to give a big thanks to the lady in concierge. She was very helpful with directions and suggestions.   Definitely will come back for another visit.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Ritz never fails to deliver a 5-star experience,
"Not a bad hotel, not my choice though especially since there are quite a few good hotels in the neighborhood. This ritz is not a part of marriott rewards program either. Overall its an ok hotel, I know many others around millennia that appeal to me more.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,not my favorite ritz,
"Stayed again at this excellent hotel.  Stayed on club floor so we had all its amenities (food presentations, and drinks from bar all day as required). As before staff were excellent - really welcoming and friendly, nothing too much trouble even when busy and stretched.  Pool and gym were excellent - clean, good range of machines and free weights.  Really good location on Marina bay - great for walking/jogging and gardens on the bay.  This is a 5 star place that excels at service.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fantastic 5 day stay,
"Hi, I never been in love with some of specific hotel, yes not before Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. This place is whole kinda perfection things. The room, the view, the staff, they all extremely good! From the moment we arrived, the staff made me feels very special. They send me a compliment cake (travelled during pregnancy), cookies and many things. Never regret to spend any penny to be here! Bravo!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Never been better,
"Impressed with the service thus far. The service provided by most Ritz Carlton Hotels KL and Singapore are consistent and impeccable. One suggestion though - could have provided a complimentary room upgrade in view of first time stay and birthday staycation - special occasion. The room dining was good but the bread and rolls are tough. Housekeeping very prompt in service. Great sleep! Love the bed but one of the side bed lights was not working. Should have a bidet in the toilet for easy access to water use. Shower ensuite flooring stained and looked run down. Overall, we had a good stay in Ritz Carlton.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great Stay so far...,
"I was here to celebrate my friend birthday, decided to make some surprise and liase with the hotel stuff which was excellent in helping out, and all plan went according to the plan. The room was way much more then I expected, was upgraded to the suites because its my friend birthday, and that was AWESOME man. enjoy the Marina view and the bathtub is the best that I was view the flyer and chill in the bathtub.

"""We will text you when your room is ready."" 7 hours later.... 3 front desk visits later.. haven't slept in 30 hours.. a so called.. ""Manager"" comes over and offers us 1 free drink as we wait for our room as it is already past check-in and we have been waiting 7 hours. This manager was overpowering and hardly allows the guest to talk. The guest is always right? That's funny. Left this hotel frustrated and charges incorrectly. Avoid at all costs. This is not your typical Ritz Carlton.",2.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Hotel Staff NEEDS Training,
"This is a solid hotel with nice view rooms. Value for money is quite good too. They take a lot of care on dining which they succeed in terms of quality of food at both the main dining room and the really nice Chinese restaurant called Summer Pavilion (try the bamboo or razor clams, super good!). Only negative comment on the dining is the layout of the chairs and tables in the main dining room feels like walking through a maze (the feng shui can't be good!) and only gives a tiny bit of walking room between tables which is a big inconvenience when it's crowded with customers getting up and down for buffet.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Nice Rooms and Very Good Dining,
"Not sure if this is a 5-star or 6-star hotel. Maybe somewhere in between. One of the best hotel I've stayed other than Raffles Hotel and St.Regis. Budget wise.....if you have the extra dollar to spare, this is highly recommended. Location wise, convenient to get around in city with MRT station which is 2-3mins walk.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Highly Recommended Hotel if you have the budget to spare,
"This hotel has the good condition & service for business group specially that require the specific & formal style. I often stay this hotel when I have business trip to Singapore. They have not only good service but also good location which is very near to Marina Bay and many good restaurants: Palm beach, Yamazaki Japanese, .... We can walk to these restaurants from hotel.  Highly recommend.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Good for business group,
I cannot say a bad word about this hotel. In these 8 days we enjoyed all the convenience of the hotel & services! I am sorry we had no time neither to try the Chinese and the Japanese restaurants nor the spa or other services of the hotel because we were too busy with Singapore everyday! Hope next time we can enjoy the hotel more. ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Meet your expectations for sure!,
"Organised an 1-day conference for 100 at the Chihuly Room at this hotel. The grandness of the hotel is undisputed with a great buffet spread. However, the attention level was low which was unexpected from such a 6-star hotel. Staff stationed during the conference should be part-timers. Either they are not well trained or they have not been given clear instructions to serve beverages well and freshening up the conference room during lunch, to prepare it for the second half afternoon session. Security briefing could have been done at a more professional level.  Guest rooms are 1st class. Same cannot be said for the conference side of things.",2.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Let Down. Disappointed by Banquet Service Level,
"From the moment of arrival our experience at the Ritz was exceptional. As it was a birthday weekend we were double upgraded to a corner suite. All staff were genuinely interested in making our stay memorable. They decorated our room in the birthday theme while we were in the lounge. We received a gift each day for the birthday girl. I cannot think of how our stay could have been any better. We will return in June 2018 to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. The Ritz Carleton is a step above in price and we feel it was worth every penny. Even at that money does not actually buy you the genuine hospitality we experienced. To a person, the staff were exceptional.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing 65th Birthday weekend at The Ritz !,
"Excellent hotel stay in Singapore and more then friendly staffs provide you excellent service. From check in till Check out, you feel hotel really care about your stay and treat you really as their valuable customer, very good to stay in here. Bye he way, the location of this hotel is very good, if you like the bay view, you must chose the Marina bay view, it is fantastic. If you like to do shopping the big shopping mall also few mins by foot. Although this hotel is not cheap in rate but it is good to increase your hotel budget in this one.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel,
"The RC hospitality is something no other hotel can replicate. We were received very warmly by all levels of staff (even the cleaners and maintenance crew), who provided very prompt and excellent service without making you feel uncomfortable. I don't know how it's possible to be treated like family and royalty at the same time but I know that Ritz Carlton has nailed it. It was extremely thoughtful of the staff to have prepared suitably-sized bathrobes for my partner and I, despite it being our first time there. We had a corner suite which came with breathtaking views of both the sea and the city skyline. I cannot wait to be back again!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Perfect to a fault!,
From the time we arrived until the time we left I have one word to describe this hotel - Perfection!!   The room was excellent and the views were out of this world.   The food was divine and the surroundings were incredible.  But the best part of the hotel was the service.   The staff were exceptional.   Nothing was too much trouble and they made our stay one that we will never forget   A special mention must go to Alexis who greeted us when we arrived.   She went out of her way to ensure that our stay was one to remember and made sure that our anniversary celebrations were very special and definitely memorable.   Impressions are everything and Alexis made sure that we will definitely be back.   Thank you.  Looking forward to our next stay.

"A little surprise upon arrival that there is noisy work going on due to renovation on a higher floor, as a result, the rooms were sold out and we can't get our room ready by 3pm as promised, other than that the breakfast, room cleanliness, in-room dining and banqueting were excellent",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Hotel with renovation,
Visited Summer Pavilion for the first time since their renovation and I love the new decor! Elegant and cozy. Food and service were top-notch. Specially enjoyed their king prawn with homemade sauce - deceptively simple looking but full of flavour. Staff were super attentive and they refreshed the entire pot of tea instead of just adding hot water to it (as with other Chinese restaurants I've been to). Will definitely be back soon. ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Delicious food and great service at Summer Pavilion,
"We have done a lot of brunches over the last few years (Pan Pacific, Regent, Equinox, Fullerton etc etc) This is hands down the best brunch in town! We went there on the 15th of October with a group of 10 and a small child and had blast! Well done and keep up the good work!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Colony Sunday Brunch,
"Well, without further due, this place was amazing. The view was mesmerizing and the staff was incredible! Everything was perfect stay wise.   Only thing I can complain about is that when I booked on the website, I wasn't made aware that this hotel is not part of the Marriot/Ritz award program. So booking a suite for the entire stay and not earning points would have probably made me go to a different place. That being said, if you don't mind not getting about 60K points back for a staying at a suite, then this is the place to stay! <3",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very good place to stay...,
"The marina view and view of the city was outstanding.  Service in the dining and bar area left a lot to be desired.  Concierge services were not helpful at all as well for excursions outside of the downtown area.  The room was clean and comfortable and the room service dining experience was also nice.  The bell service and front desk were excellent as expected with the name, but overall for the money I would stay at the Marina Bay or other hotel nearby.  Views from the Singapore Flyer and other locations gave plenty of breathtaking photo opportunities night and day.    It was only afternoon tea, bar, and concierge services that left a bad taste in my mouth.  You'd be better off booking excursions and traveling online and outside of the hotel's services including money exchange.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Great view, but forgettable",
"We checked in at nearly midnight but the service was amazing, firstly from Isis on the door service then onto Douglas on the desk who needs a very special mention!  He was so helpful, happy and polite and then gave us an amazing 'Surprise' room upgrade by not telling us but walking us up and then opening the door to an amazing Bay view facing suite.  Amazing views, staff were all so helpful and polite and our stay was fantastic, nothing was too much effort for the team.  The in room dining was great quality and speedy.  We had drinks in the bar one evening before going out which again the service was great and the view of the huge great big Sun art piece was great.  Its a shame they didnt have a dress code in the bar mind.  Highly recommended to stay at the Ritz!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Douglas was superb!,
"Suitable for parents and children, the bay area, the room scenery is very good, very good, children can be stamped prizes very interesting, very good experience. Breakfast is also extremely rich, lunch can not eat, children every day and free ice cream",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,很适合亲子，地点也方便,
"We had moved to the Ritz after a disappointing stay at the Mandarin Oriental next door.   I had tagged along with my hubby as our anniversary coincided with his business trip.  We booked a deluxe room and were not disappointed!  - Rooms are bright and airy with beautiful views! - Service was above and beyond! - Breakfast was one of the best EVER, truly five star. - Room Service burger was great! - The gym was airy with all the latest equipment.  The concierge team were super helpful in recommending places for us to go and super friendly and accommodating.   I have nothing bad to say about this hotel at all!  Keep up the good work!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Just Splendid!,
"Our second visit and stay at the Ritz. We were offered a room upgrade to accomodate the family. Although an expensive option, the room was spacious enough for the extra beds and views were amazing. The club access was well worth it. The staff were courteous and helpful. The location of the hotel is spot on and is walking distance to many attractions and shopping. The dining options in house are excellent and one is spoilt for choice. Would highly recommend it.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,High standards,
We stayed as a family at The Ritz-Carlton for 6 days.It is a great hotel but could have been better.We got so bored with the Breakfast menu which was the same for all the 6 days.Even the order of the dishes was just the same to an extent you can serve yourself blindfolded.We could not get the Marina Bay view as were asked to pay up extra - which was again disappointing considering the fact that we stayed for 6 days.The staff are very good even though the front office staff when we checked in was not very friendly.Special mention to Azreen who was excellent and probably one of the best staff in the hotel. Will try out a different hotel the next time.Not recommended for families but very good one for Business trips.,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Could have been Better,
"Really nice to be back. Not much has changed. Excellent rooms, food, service.  Very sweet staff , really makes you feel wanted.

"Although the food at Colony was excellent, it is the staff who are the real reason you must eat here. We have never encountered service like this anywhere else in the world. From Connie, the greeter, to Hai Rong and Kevin, our waiters, you will not get a better experience of just how exceptional Singapore is.They are outstanding people who make eating not just a pleasure but a memorable experience.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Colony Restaurant,
The Ritz Carlton Club was a very disappointing experience compared to most other hotel clubs. The food selections and quantity were very poor. The club room itself was very small and had that cramped in feeling. If you choose to have your breakfast in the restaurant area you were charged extra for the privilege. There was just no atmosphere in the club room that made you want to be there.,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very disappointing club experience,
"Firstly, very good impression of the hotel lobby, clean and spacious and not noisy. Staffs were all really friendly as well and polite. The room itself is also very clean, with everything provided. Great view (overlooking MBS and CBD area). Good noise cancellation in the room too. The pool and gym was equally good too. Very very satisfied indeed.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Indeed a top class hotel,
"I think the name of the ritz Carlton speaks of its self , however the rooms in this hotel and the toilet is huge comparing to any 5 star hotel I have been into even to other ritz Carlton hotel around the world.  The hotel in the best location you can possibly have in Singapore , everything is in walking distance or at lesser short trip in a taxi .  My only comments was the choices they have in breakfast , all the Asian type of breakfast were there but not western or at least they are not fresh ( no fresh Pancake) . ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Perfect location and perfect services but breakfast options not much !,
"This hotel is amazing. From the moment we walked in to the time we left we were treated like honoured guests. Nothing was too much trouble, for instance the waiter making sure we had enough to eat at the buffet or the lady in the pool checking our towels. Every mod con available but definitely the staff make the difference. Can't wait to our next visit to Singapore",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,If I could give six stars,
Besides missing the great harbour view you will hear highway noise all night.  The road is busy and the traffic seems to echo behind the Ritz the Mandarin and another hotel in the vicinity.    I would take any harbour facing room at any other of the adjacent but less well appointed properties rather than have to listen to a highway run through my room. If you cannot get a harbour facing room then do not stay here.   The rooms are large by Asia city standards. House keeping and staff is up to snuff.   The breakfast and lunch buffet is extravagant. The sushi restaurant on the property is a solid dinner option.   For anyone with jet lag or that is easily awoken avoid the ritz speedway rooms.  ,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Avoid non harbour facing rooms ,
"Thus is truly an amazing hotel. The rooms are huge; even the smallest is as big as a suite in any other hotel. The pool area, gym and associated spa are world class. The buffet dinner food included fresh oysters, prawns, lobster and Peking duck. There's a takeaway coffee/pastry cafe in the lobby if you just want a snack for breakfast. The view of the marina from the rooms is gorgeous. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,The best hotel ever.,
"I had a strong dissatisfaction with some employees during my stay. Ignore orders, outright racial discrimination, etc. There are also good employees. However, due to malicious employees, it is messed up.

"We stayed for a brief break en route from Sydney to London. We chose the Ritz Carlton.   The hotel entirely met our expectations - it excels in the service and courtesy of its high quality staff, and the rooms are highly detailed, clean and quiet. Whilst the food in the Colony restaurant is a bit expensive, it is high quality, and there is great variety. The concierge team made  a great effort to provide useful information during our stay.   I noticed the staff remember names and details, even after only a brief contact, and numerous pleasant conversations ensued, which left us with very fond memories of Singapore, and its intelligent, successful and open culture. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful  service and quality,
"Amazing trip and first stay at this hotel. The breakfasts, which are included in the room price, were at another level. Miss them!

"I stayed three nights at the SG Ritz-Carlton for business. From the moment of arrival all of the way through check-out the service was top notch. The room was very nice, view great, etc...

Look forward to staying again soon at the property.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel with Best in Class Service,
"Just  retuned from 5 night post cruise stay at Ritz Singapore Club Level.  My husband and I were treated like royalty.  The Club Level experience at this property is outstanding.

Adora you are an angel! Lendl for my AM cappuccino and afternoon Riesling.  Katherine, you made our journey home smooth.  I wish I was on the 32nd floor with all of you right now.

"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia when Formula One was in town and the hotel was fully booked. I expected there would be small set backs because of the full occupation but this hotel is simply so good that everything was perfect as usual, inspite of the full occupation. The lobby bar is the local hub during F1 and everybody hangs out there, great service, good food and good ambiance. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable with great amenities. The club lounge has exquisite bites and drinks with very professional staff assisting you with every single need you may have.

"My husband and I came here with some family as a wedding present to the Sunday Brunch. It was the most fabulous afternoon out. First off the champagne is included, if you go for the alcohol package, and they are very generous with it unlike a lot of other places. The service is amazing and every time you need a refill they are on hand to help. Now the food is out of this world. Being a fussy English woman there was such a variety of food that I managed to find plenty. The dauphinois potatoes were honesty the best I've ever had. The sweet selection at the end was fun and offered lots of variation. All in all it's an amazing day out and I would highly recommend visiting if your in Singapore on a Sunday. It's quite expensive but if you make the most of it it's great value for money!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Brunch ,
"I've stayed at The Ritz-Carlton Singapore before and was happy find that this time around things were still at a very high standard.

"This is my second time staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore this year, and the experience was very positive.  The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  They have full service and amenities.  The pool is very large and big enough for business folks wanting to swim laps and families with kids to enjoy.  I wish there was an outdoor  Jacuzzi at the pool as the only ones they have are in the spa area.  I only ate at the buffet for breakfast and a few dinners.  The food and service was outstanding.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel!,

We thought about Marina Bay when initially booking our honeymoon but trust me the Ritz Carlton is a far better choice! The only hotel I want to ever stay at!,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,honeymoon travel,
The location of The Ritz is at a great location; definitely go for the marina bay view!  It's view are spectacular during day or night.  Everything about the hotel exudes elegance.  The bed is super comfy and all amenities you need for a comfortable stay.   The reason for the four stars is because the room that I originally booked was for a club room with Marina bay views.  But they checked us in a room that was facing the back. So imagine the hassle having to go back to the front desk and bring up the mistake and wait for associate to locate the correct room view; all this while I'm still daze from the long long flight getting in almost midnight.  I don't think it's acceptable for a hotel such as The Ritz to make such a mistake.  ,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Perfect location for a relaxing getaway,
"I have to say I am very impressed by this hotel. The rooms are superb, very comfortable and the pool are, gym and bar are fantastic. Location is good with access to a mall directly from the hotel so all in all really good. What I found a real let down was the breakfast area. It very confusing, The fodd areas are all different little corners and  food groups are not arrange together in logical way. It was a really confusing and frustrating experience due to the flow. The quality of teh food is absolutely superb so no issue there just the organsiation.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing views BUT breakfast needs to be improved,

During the ICC (Football) tournament we booked this Hotel. Later we found out that one of the clubs Chelsea was also staying here. The staff was very nice & helpful. The rooms are pretty big & bathroom in particular gives breathtaking views of Singapore Skyline. The food inside the hotel is little bit expensive if compared to Singapore average but then its Ritz Carlton brand. The swimming pool was superb as well and Gym is not that big but pretty sufficient. Location wise its perfectly located in the heart of Singapore City and you can sea the Marina bay sands. All & all one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. Special mention the Deputy Concierge 'Adam' that guy is a legend.  ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Simply Awesome !,
"Stayed in the hotel in a business trip. The hotel is very well located, close to several business centers. The gym is excellent, with new equipment. The pool seems quite nice as well, although I have not used. Breakfast is complete with full variety. The check-in and check-out is a bit slow and could improve, mind also the time to obtain a taxi as on peak hours it could require some minutes waiting. Also found the food at the hotel overpriced, sparkling waters & drinks very expensive as well. All in all, very good hotel to stay, recommend.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Perfect, great installations!",
"From the moment we arrived, until we check out, this hotel just keep us amaze. Bell counter, check in, house keeping, pool attendant, security, the lady at the kids theme room, the helpful Ms.Riri (FOM) if I'm not mistaken, just make our stay very enjoyable and memorable.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,8 night of Joy,
"We had a business breakfast w 42 people and it was appealing how bad the service was.  Firstly it took ages that all 42 guest had breakfast , should have been more coordinated. Jam and butter on the table but no bread served at all. Coffee was served after the breakfast was done! No milk on the table. Clearly I would suggest the Ritz Carlton can do better than this. ",2.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very disappointing ,
"Recommended not to plan your stay there when there is special occasion (e.g. National Day, Christmas Day, etc). Room assigned most likely will not be the one you want. Due to the high demand for housekeeping and front desk services, be prepared to wait for a while before getting attended.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Do not recommend stay on special public holidays,
"Awesome view of the floating platform. Close enough to view the NDP. Especially the fireworks, air show and drone display practically at eye level and at close proximity.   Gorrrrrrgeous view of the Sg skyline during the day from every window, even the tub in the bathroom.  Wonderful service of course. Room clean up was prompt when we pressed the ""service"" bell and so quickly done they finished by the time we came back from breakfast.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,National day staycation,

"It became an annual affairs for my family to enjoy a staycation to watch the fireworks at Marina Bay in a safe and comfortable environment.

Good service and keep to the standard. :)  ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A good experience all the time,
Very Large and comfortable room.   It's a little bit dated but the staff are very helpful and the service very good.  The bed very comfy!  The breakfast experience is good although the area so cluttered it's hard to move around and find what you want.  I had a breakfast included rate which I recommend as the food generally is expensive.  I discovered the spa facility on my last day and wished I had prior - it looks lovely. I had an enjoyable experience.,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay ,
"The Ritz was really disappointing on my second visit there. Food quality had declined, returning Ritz visitors treated worse than first time ones, and they don't participate in the SPG program so you won't get any points for your stay. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.",2.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Don't bother,
"Definitely a truly memorable staycation for my younger sister and myself. Making it happen on behalf of her future husband wish, who is currently in Melbourne on work matters.

"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Singapore as we were on our way to New Zealand, so we used it as a transit hotel.  The reception area was nice and the staff were very friendly. However, the room wasn't up to expectations unfortunately. It was quite dated and there was damage to some of the furniture in the room. It was also quite noisy. We enquired about moving to another room (due to the noise from outside) however the hotel didn't have any other suitable rooms available that had 2 separate beds. For the price paid, it wasn't a great stay.  I wouldn't stay here again unfortunately, which is a shame, as the staff were fantastic but the room wasn't good unfortunately.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Not a great hotel for the price paid,
"Even though I made a special reservation, they did not have our reservation and wanted my daughter to sleep on a pull out bed (she is 23 years old and 5'9""). We have to move rooms twice as the air conditioning was not working, eventually we resorted to fans in the room. We were warned there was some renovation work related noise between 10.00 am to 19.00.

"From the moment we checked in the emphasis was on providing a personal and friendly experience. We were travelling with a 4 year old and he was not only included in the experience but received his ""own ""door key and the staff remembered and used his name.

"Third stay at this hotel and still one of the best hotel experiences we have had. The feeling of calm and serenity when you enter the building is palpable. The service is second to none. We had club rooms with a marina bay view and recommend both wholeheartedly. Service in the club lounge was personal and attentive and the quality of food and drink consistently high. The wine was exceptional for a hotel lounge. Staff took the time to talk and engage which made our stay all the more enjoyable.   The views from the marina bay rooms are exceptional and truly have the wow factor. Either by day or by night, you will not find a better panorama of the bay. Location is superb.  We will be back",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,One of the best,
"Spectacularly beautiful as you can expect - it's one of the must sees in Singapore. Try and stop for a drink if you can - I had the blueberry iced tea - a little expensive yes, but worth the experience and a good chance to get out of the heat outside!   Pools are amazing. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Afternoon tea ,
"The hotel is easy to access from MRT and next to the department store. We got the room that came with a stunning view of marina Bay and lucky to see the rehearsal performance for Singapore National Day from our room. Breakfast was nice and many options. My favorite drink was pink guava, very delicious. Staffs were attention to detail and nice. The hotel is not far from my favorite chili crab restaurant as well :-).",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very nice hotel and good location,
"Service was inconsistent and at times failing expectations. I suspect this is due to the high turn over rate and 6 month employment of interns. The hotel definitely has one of the best views of the Marina Bay. Great walking distance to the action and MRT stations. Also, this Ritz-Carlton does not participate in rewards program. I would probably have stayed at the Westin if not for the wonderful views.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Ritz-Carlton Singapore,
"So on my 2nd visit to Singapore I wanted to try something different (previously stayed at Marina Bay Sands and Raffles).  I was blown away by the Ritz Carlton. The understated elegance, personal service and luxury won me over. The food was superb and the room was perfect in every way. No gimmicks, just luxury and comfort.  The views of the Marina Bay complex blew us away.  The only gripe: the pool was being renovated so no pool, hence our decision to go to W in Sentosa for the second half of our singapore stopover. Kids club was also a work in progress. Also booked late so missed out on getting the much sought after new years eve booking on way back. I loved this hotel. Will definitely return.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,MY FAVOURITE HOTEL,
"Our recent stay at the Ritz Carlton in Singapore was initially planned as a nice stop off for a couple of days on our way back from 5 weeks in New Zealand. Our enjoyment of the beautiful city of Singapore but more especially the simply wonderful staff and surroundings of the Ritz Carlton made our visit a hugely memorable experience. The hotel is without doubt one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. If visiting Singapore make sure that you stay there, you will not be dissapointed.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Probably the best hotel in Singapore,
This is an iconic hotel. A little dated but perfectly maintained.  Luxury and comfort in perfect balance.  The best part is the location and price. Perfect for the business traveler or family vacation.  Don't do the Marina Bay Sands thing. It's overrated and overpriced. You can go take a look but don't stay there. This is where you want to be. Hope they start a new remodel soon to keep the rooms current but you can hardly go wrong with a stay here.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,One fine Singapore icon,
The Room: Room and view was amazing with exceptionally good room service. The hotel were good enough to upgrade us to a suite room with fantastic view of the marina bay. The staffs at the check in were very polite and friendly and gave us good service.  The Club Lounge experience compared with other hotels: No complimentary buffet breakfast at colony No complimentary non-alcoholic beverages from the in-room mini bar and if you are a person who loves food together with the nice view then ritz will be a disappointment. The food quality and variety was very poor and ranks the lowest in all the club lounges we have been.The club lounge service was also below expectation.  We hope ritz will improve this as well,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Ritz-Carlton Club Lounge Experience,
"I could not think of going to Singapore without staying at the Ritz Carlton Millenia. It encapsulates the modernity of Singapore, its traditions and the meeting of cultures. It is, too, like a museum, from the building perforated by a mighty circle, to the rooms with huge hexagonal windows to the bay, to the Chihuli lighting arrangements, to the food. The service is second to none. The attention to detail is uncanny. I have always felt special there. Life is wonderful, it is a pleasure to the senses. Don't miss the pool with a waterfall fountain or the room service. They even made personalised visiting cards for us for longer stays. The best, trust me. If you like the good life, you will love this hotel.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,A true six-star experience,
"Hats off to the management of Ritz Carlton for ensuring that all your staff goes the extra mile for guest satisfaction.Every single one of them deserves a pat on the back for all their efforts.

"I cannot fault this hotel and would love to stay here again. The staff were friendly and efficient. I arrived on after an early morning flight and was shown to the spa to freshen up and relax while a room became available, which was a great way to start my stay, I was lucky enough to be on the 32nd club floor , and the all day restaurant makes for a very relaxing stay as breakfast is only a short walk along the corridor, with the most amazing views.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Made to feel special from the moment i walked up to the door,

"We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton as a groups for a business meeting. The facilities are top and we were able to work very efficiently. Everything in this hotel is top. From staff to food to gym to hotel room. Great running tracks in the early morning if you can deal with heat/humidity. If not, there are tons of treadmills in the gym. The pool opens early in the morning allowing you to cool down after the workout.   The package is top, top, top. Free WiFi and great location are a bonus to an already convincing offering.

The suite had a wonderful view of the pit area for the Formula one race from both the window and bath tub. The breakfast and evening offerings in the lounge were outstanding. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable. The lounge upgrade is well worth the price.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Worth the price for club access,
4th stay at the Ritz. Each time we tried different rooms. The rooms were definitely bigger than the average size hotel room. Bathroom were huge with a good range of amenities.   Service at the Ritz never disappoints. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. Kids gets RitzKids tags with free ice cream. Pool is a bit basic though.   Will definitely come for another staycay soon.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great personalised Service,
"I arrived at the hotel having made an Amex fine hotels and resorts reservation. The room was not available at noon and the staff told me they would call me when it was ready. They never called. When I approached the front desk late afternoon, they weren't even aware I had already checked in. The doorman were friendly and the location is great...minutes to Sentosa. Views from the rooms are incredible but the rooms need some updating. The spa is adequate and the rooms are of average size. ",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Not up to Ritz standard,
We love the room not just because of the spacious design but also material quality and well thought little details like hidden power points in drawers. All the personnel was good except receptionists.They did not seem friendly.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent (except Reception),
"i arrived at hotel very late due to my flight delay like 11pm. i was worry about the that day's dinner since i did not have time to eat dinner until i got hotel. i asked any options when i check in, and they said you can oader hotel restaurant menu from lounge and let me and my friends had dinner at lounge.  officially, lounge should be close about 11pm, but they gave us service until our dinner finish. i was really appreciate this service. huge thanks for them!!!  room is just OK level. the view was amazing!!! just space is bit smaller than other location. still understandable for this view and location.   view and guest service are the best part of this hotel.  highly recommend.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,best service at club lounge,
Lovely well placed hotel near most things and within easy walking distance of Marina Bay Sands.  Rooms and views are spectacular and facilities outstanding.  Food and drinks are also high class.  Best Singapore sling we had whilst in town and you won't know where to start for breakfast with the range of options.  Great day spa and very helpful staff.  Recommend ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel,
"There are many things I like about this hotel. Room was spacious and quiet, the bathroom came with a view and the bed was comfortable. We asked for some amenities for our toddler and they were quick to accommodate and even provided a pair of small bathroom slippers.   Breakfast was great with plenty of choices. The only thing is it was challenging to get the food which was spread out in different sections when you are alone with a toddler.  Lobby area was spacious and staff was friendly.   The only improvement I could think of is probably have a proper play area for children instead of a room assigned. Perhaps some activity play kit at the breakfast area or given as part of the amenities in the room for family with young children. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Nice view & spacious room!,
"Perfection from start to finish. No fuss, not fancy, just easy and stylish. Looked after when we needed, plenty of space when we didn't. The club floor was  worth it and made it all the more special. When in Singa with will never stay any where else",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,WOW,
Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore is an all time classic favourite hotel. Gorgeous views of the Singapore Skyline. Easy access to the mall. Rooms are still very well maintained despite age of the hotel. Good hotel to spend quality time with family or even loved ones. Staff is friendly as usual and this is the Ritz Carlton signature for its brand that is renowned.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fact the your bath tub is overlooking the bay is simply happiness,
"We loved the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore. But it's mostly about the view. It is better than Mandarin Oriental's Harbor view rooms. The Summer Pavilion restaurant is also very good for experienced foodies. However, i forgot an item in the room and the level at which they handled this issue is not up to their standards. Overall, I'd say Ritz Carlton Singapore is at he sme level with the St. Regis Osaka, Kempinski Vienna and Kempinski Berlin. Top notch!",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent except one issue,
We stayed on the 30th floor. Ceiling to floor views across to Marina Bay Sands - must be the best water views in Singapore. The bath had the same stunning views.  Decor was exceptional. Beautiful leather and timber paneling.  Let down by a hot water tap not working in the bathroom basin - not helped by tardy response to have it fixed.,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Spectacular water views,
"Had very good overall experience. It is he Ritz Carlton after all. The front desk was wonderful, the hotel staffs were wonderful. My kids loved the Ritz kids and asking to go back even after the stay.   However, the room I was given comes with creaky floor. It is annoying when you have a light sleeper with you. I have to avoid the ""traps"" when walking across to the bathroom. I would have thought that this portion should be well maintained.   My internet TV on that few days stay wasn't that great. It was pausing all the way. I had a hard time explaining to my kids why the TV program is like that.   Other than this 2 small quirk, the rest of the stay was great! Good location, great staffs and beautiful scenery. ",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,First stay with Ritz Carlton Singapore,
From the moment you arrive they know your name and treat you like royalty.  The breakfast was unreal and had a choice of every food you could ever imagine.  The bar was v relaxed and nice.  The hotel is so close to marina bay and the park with so much to offer like the garden in the clouds and other amazing places near marina bay sands.  From my experience at this hotel I would recommend it to anybody.  The room I had on the 25th even had a bathroom with a huge bath at the huge window looking over the building and some of the marina.  The views of the marina from the lounge in the room were spectacular.  Wow and thank you for a fabulous stay I wish it had been for longer. ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Exceeded every expectation. ,

I particularly remember Lavin at the Concierge, the lady who checked me in and wrote me a kind welcome note, and Angel at the Spa, and Nita who did my facial.

I will be back!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fantastic stay at the Ritz!,
"When you book to stay in a Ritz Carlton Hotel you know that you will be staying in luxury and that quality is assured. We had a wonderful stay here while we explored Singapore.

The Marina area proved to be a great location and central to everything. Staff were very gracious and welcoming.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Luxurious as you would expect,
"Was extremely  happy with the 3 nights stayed at the hotel. My husband and I were specifically impressed with the cordial, loving, professional, generous and kind attitude received from Ms. Murphy ( Concierge). We also appreciate Ms. Nadia's (Consierge) professional and loving attitude. We wish them the very best of success in their career, and look forward to meet again in the very near future. We should also not overlook the professional and cordial attitude of the rest of the staff at the hotel, wish addedmore happiness to our visit to Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Magnificent,

"Overall I was quite impressed with the property and staff.  Very well trained and attentive.  My only complaint is that I tend to prefer my room to be very cool, which I was not able to achieve below 21 degrees centigrade.  Room was extremely nice and large.  Nothing but compliments to staff for attention to detail.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very nice hotel only one minor complaint,
"From the moment the doorman opened our car door to the moment we left, it was a great experience, as staff were so friendly and attentive. Our room looking over marina bay was comfortable and spacious and the automatic blackout blinds made it an easy place to sleep after a long flight. The breakfast had a amazing choice for all tastes in an unusual and attractive setting.  If you get the chance use the new fantastic pool area to relax  ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Superb,
"I stayed at many high end hotels, so far this is the best hotel, not by design but by their customer service!

",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent service and beautiful hotel!!,
"Comfortable, spacious room. Well organized system with kind staffs. Everything is perfect that I'm willing to revisit and recommend my friends, or colleagues for staying in Singapore.

"From the luxurious and enormous rooms with breathtaking views across the bay to the indulgent spa, pool and superbly equipped gym, this hotel was everything we hoped for and more.

An amazing hotel that we will return to next time we are in Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,The breathtakingly beautiful Ritz-Carlton,
"Ritz Carlton Millenia makes you feel so special at every moment. Easy and fast check in , beautiful rooms with amazing views. The hotel has been renovated recently and I really appreciated the design of the room , swimming pool and specially the spa !

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for luxury and high end service. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Such a Ritz'laxing experience !,
"From the second we arrived our family of 4 (2 year old and 5 year old) have been so well looked after, no detail missed. We can not fault this hotel or its service. Our suite has the best views of the marina, absolutely breathtaking. Could not recommend it highly enough and would never stay anywhere else if visiting this area.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Faultless,
"This is our first time in Singapore and just wanted to try the Ritz-Carleton. The room was beautiful and the view from the room was especially breathtaking. We had the use of the executive lounge and this was a good option to add to the stay in the hotel. The variety of the things they serve at the lounge was quite good. The spa/gym area is also very nice. There are not so many people who use the sauna and steam bath, so I was alone when I went there a few times. All and all, the service was excellent at the Ritz-Carleton. Everyone is very attentive and helpful.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Expensive, but nice hotel.",
"We stayed 5 nights in 2 interconnecting rooms with Marina Bay view. The hotel, service and views are first class, the staff extremely helpful and friendly. I'd thank to thank them all, especially Phil in the Colony restaurant who remembered us from last year and Christine at the front desk. The renovated pool area is lovely and we enjoyed spending time relaxing there after busy days out and about with the kids. I have stayed many times over the years on business and more recently on vacation with the family. I'd always like to return and stay here, but we found it very expensive this year, of which a lot is due to the strong local currency. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Another amazing trip to Singapore ,
"I've checked in this afternoon for a 2 night break with my wife. We are both so very impressed with the room size, view and decor not to mention the great service! Great job Ritz ... tho' I do wonder why you don't participate in the Rewards Program. For shoppers and food enthusiasts, several malls are connected directly to the hotel.

"If you are looking for the best suite in hotel in Singapore book the corner suite at the Ritz Carlton at Marina Bay Area The views are amazing The service outstanding Use of 32  nd Floor lounge for free breakfast ,afternoon tea and evening drinks is added bonus The decor is light and fresh  Must do is the buffet ! Worth every cent!!! Highly recommend and more than a 5 star ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,The best in Singapore-book a corner suite,
"Due to special occasion, I was offered upgrade to Marina bay view room. It has definitely the best view among any of the Singapore hotels.   Everything was beyond expectation. Staff are all attentive with heart of true hospitality. When I ordered room service, they even brought us a movable dining table to my room. (The room service menu was surprisingly with a reasonable price tag)  I would definitely come back.    What a pity that it is not in part of the Marriott rewards program.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fantastic!,

"I am asked to transfer my membership from Marriot online upon receiving the confirmation from The Ritz Millenia Singapore, only realized they are not part of the program when arrived at the hotel during check in process. I do not earn any rewards for my stay here with them but I also lost my membership with Marriot. It is such a Scam!!!",1.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Scam on membership program,
"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Millenia and had a terrific time.  The hotel staff was unbelievably helpful, cheerful, and couldn't do enough to ensure that our stay was pleasant.  The location is awesome.  Right across from the harbor, and walking distance to many attractions.  Easy, taxi to any other locales.  The fitness center and spa were great, with almost all the equipment I use with my personal trainer at home.   The pool area is so serene, almost forgot that I'm in the middle of the big city.  Can't say enough good things, will definitely stay again when back in Singapore.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"What a great hotel, with great staff",
Well located for a quiet stay. Good neighbour hood. Not too public. Good facilities nearby except a bit far from major shopping centres. Fantastic view from the room of the beautiful Marina Bay landscape.,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,General impression of the hotel,
"In the early and mid 2000's, i had a chance to stay here frequently, about 2-3 time per year during my business travel to SG.  For me, this Ritz property holds a special place in my heart as it's the first true luxury property that I have had the pleasure of staying in.  The rooms are great and so is the bathroom with the huge window.  Took me over 10 years to visit again in 2016 but this time to enjoy a dinner seafood buffet with my wife.  Still a gem!  The room rates have gone up with the improving SG economy.  I remember you could stay here for $100 USD/night but definitely not now.  During recent stay, I made a poor, poor choice to stay at the Westin.  I wish I had stayed here or at the St. Regis.  Oh well, live and learn.  Still a 5 star in my books.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"It's more than a hotel, it's like a second home",
"Cannot say enough good things about this hotel!!  Chihuly glass in several locations, great service, beautiful room, delicious and varied food. The spa is wonderful, very relaxing.

Only place I would stay in Singapore",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Hotel and Spa,
Our stay in at The Ritz was exceptional. The hotel has thought of everything to make a guest comfortable. The staff was not only friendly but also anticipated your needs. It was very relaxing with big bright room and bathroom. Beautiful view. ,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Exceptional,
We did eat here - we did the lunch buffet that was really good and sumpteous. The only thing that went wrong was we could not eat as much as our eyes would have likede too. The area with asian specialty was great.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Very good buffet,
"Stayed here many times, but this time got wrong room, mix up with breakfast and issues with charging. Was there for work and did not want to spend time queing at front desk to sort out problems. Think I wont stay here next time but in another hotel. Havent had these problems when I stayed at some of the other 5 star hotels which has been very smooth.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great hotel but poor service for price,
"Excellent Service. The staff at the club lounge were great and able to accede to our requests.  Food served at the club lounge was excellent. However, they need to improve their variety as I know it is getting lesser over the years. Overall, memorable stay.  I would continue to come back for special occasions.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,MEMORABLE STAY,
"We're a family of 5 (2 adults + 1 child + 2 toddlers), got the deluxe room and the reservation department we're OK with us packing the room despite the high number of occupants. Due to this, we ended up stating for 4 nights which I think is just nice.   Everyone loved it, the view, the amenities and the nice view. Kids will be kids, the room became a mess in no time. But housekeeping knew about this and kept coming often to clean the place up in no time. Everything within control was kept near perfect condition in no time.  Therefore, next time you stuck here for work/conference/etc, bring your family with and all of you will have a nice time here. The infrastructure is sufficient to handle all of you.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Nice room for a family,
"This is my 1st time staying at Ritz-Carlton and no doubt the cost of staying is higher compared to other hotels, the service you are getting is definitely worth the value. Special thanks to Front Office staff, Felicia whom is always attentive and responsive during my check-in and check-out. Upon hearing that i am here for my wedding anniversary celebration, a hand-written letter of well wishes and complimentary champagne is sent to my room. My wife is delighted and we will definitely return for a 2nd stay.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,FEELS WELCOME AND PROMPT SERVICE,
"Weeklong stay for a conference/business trip. Typical Ritz service, everyone very nice and always greeted by my name.   Breakfast buffet outstanding, plenty of choices.   Conference facilities were good, but a bit dark (makes it hard to not nod off when you're jet lagged)  Was given a lower floor room with a lousy view. Asked if I could get something better but they told me would be an additional 150 SgD per night. Understandable I guess.   Wallpaper was peeling in bathroom but other than that room itself was fine.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Friendly, but sterile",
"Went for buffet dinner with friends. Very crowded even for a weekday evening so reservation is a must. The choice of food, space layout and service were above average although the array of dessert could be improved. It is a nice place to dine and to chill as it is surprisingly quiet enough to have a conversation.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Memorable dinner,
"So I arrived at check-in and it was clear that they were struggling, my room was not ready and I had to return on three separate occasions,  They offered me alternative rooms but they were not what I had booked.  Eventually they offered me an upgrade of a corner suite which was amazing, the room was spotless with some fantastic views of the bay, the in-room facilities were top notch and the room service was first class, I have stayed in many hotels like this but this was by far and away one of the best.  Douglas and his front desk team were extremely helpful and always willing to answer any questions, if I could make one small suggestion it would be to improve the checking-in system, although other than that, I would highly recommend a stay there if only for the wonderful views.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Poor Start but more than made up for it,
"We stayed in the club room with Marina Bay view. The view is very nice reminds me of Sydney or Honk King skyline.   The room is very clean and spacious. It only has one sink.   The club lounge serves the normal breakfast, appetizers and evening drinks. The staff is attentive.   ",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Hotel with a View,

"Just returned from the most fabulous Sunday Brunch in the wonderful Colony Restaurant. We wanted for nothing, the food was sublime, the champagne perfect and the staff's friendliness and attention to detail was second to none! In particular, we must single out Michelle for a special mention. She looked after us brilliantly and her manner was exactly what we would expect - always on  hand to me every sure we had everything we wanted - she is a credit to your hotel. If your looking for a first-class Sunday Brunch, look no further. It doesn't get any better than this! ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Perfect Sunday Brunch ,
"Situated in an ideal spot, not congested unlike in Orchard area. Walking distance to Marina Bay Sands where one can spend the whole day of high-end shopping and eating at a handful of celebrity chef restaurants. If you fancy more middle class shops/restaurants, Ritz Carlton is connected via walkways to Marina Square, Millennia Walk, and Suntec. Staff and management were incredibly polite, helpful, and absolutely luxury service oriented. Loved the gym and pool. Will definitely stay here again. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Will Go Back! ,
The view was amazing and the bathroom and room generally were very well set. These were the only reasons for staying at this hotel. There was no affordable food or snack for us at the hotel and it was a long hike of 2 floors to go to any adjoining restaurant or mall. Plus window washers came outside the window 4 times without any warning although we had do not disturb sign on. ,4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Good but not worth price,
"although disappointed with a smaller scale kids club compared to last time and renovated pool without any kids pool, kids still enjoy their stay with the safari theme. Hotel stay is still very good with the ever warm staff, nice breakfast and close proximity to malls.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Ritz Carlton with Ritz Kids facility,
Large selection of food all of very good quality. The unlimited champagne really was on tap with the waitresses always on hand to top up without being asked. Would have liked a few cocktails but they only had G&T which I don't like,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Sunday brunch ,
"Nice expensive high end hotel, but if you're a loyal Rewards member, know that it won't matter. They don't participate, even though they can see your status. No upgrades, no perks, no points.

"Club Premier Suite is easily one of the best room of hotels in Singapore with marble bathroom with panoramic views of the city areas and the double sinks made it easier for newly-wed couples most memorable stay with separate bathtub and shower areas. Located on the upper floors above Level 22, the complimentary high-speed internet access and the 46"" LED TV and spacious living and long table for works or reading purposes made the stay one of the most memorable one.

It was an experience I would recommend to anyone who enjoys their food- such variety of food of outstanding quality in one place is not to be missed.   Staff was exceptional- our waiter Darren was the best, very nice, polite and attentive. We all loved him!  Great value for money as well, ask about an evening promotion for drinks.  In addition to the exceptional food and staff, the dining rooms are beautiful which makes the experience even more special. Visit even if you're not staying at the hotel.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fine dining at its best,
"I was here only for a company event. I can't comment on the rooms and other services.

"We have been coming here since it opened in 1996 and the quality of the staff, service, rooms and food is exceptional. If you are able to get a Marina Bay room the views are wonderful especially at night. The pool and spa have been given a comprehensive makeover and are lovely. The Colony restaurant has a buffet that we feel is one of the best in the world. Eva at the pool, Kevin in F&B, Nabil who looked after us in The Colony and last but by no means least is the wonderful Sheila in Front Office - all made this a trip to remember THANKYOU !",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Yet another amazing visit, this place never fails to please",

The club lounge welcome children but there was no food really suitable provided for children even when we have requested with the chef. It was disappointing that they did not really make an effort.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  ,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Club lounge,
I seriously loved this hotel.  We were staying for a layover but wanted a bit of comfort and pampering and boy did we get it.  The staff from the moment we got out of the taxi were to a person friendly and helpful but without seeming forced or pushy.  Our room was amazing with a great view of the water surrounding high rises.  I simple cannot fault one thing.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,This place is the best,
"Excellent location, close to the marina and other attractions.  Easy access to nearby shopping, restaurants, and running paths. Very limited ""nightlife"" at the hotel but easy to access Clark Quay and other places by foot or taxi.  The rooms are spacious and very well kept.  The views are incredible if you have a Marina view room.  Not sure what the other rooms overlook.  Breakfast is a bit pricey but well worth it, expansive selection from all around Asia.  The Fitness Center is very well equipped with new equipment  Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel for the Business Traveler,
"This is a decent hotel that caters well to business travellers. Well located around the marina, has all the facilities you'd expect and the rooms are well-equipped, if a little tired / in need of a bit of renovation. View across marina from my room was phenomenal. Restaurant for breakfast / lunch - especially choice and quality of food - was excellent. Lifts a bit annoying - I waited 10 mins for a lift to get down from 23rd floor to lobby.  What set it apart for me was the staff. I was feeling unwell the evening I arrived and they were super-helpful and genuinely concerned. Generally there was always a member of staff on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Staff here made all the difference,

We will be back whenever in Singapore!",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great stay exceeded expectations ,
Spent a weekend in Singapore en route to Australia.  After significant research opted for the Ritz even though it was priced far higher than many other 5 star hotels such as the Four Seasons and the Mandarin.  Unfortunately it was not worth it.  The club level corner suite I stayed in had a great view but was tired.  The general  service level was fine but certainly not particularly special.  We arrived early and were told we would be contacted as soon as our room was ready but  that never happened. Could not relax by the pool as although it is now open after having been closed it still has noisy construction going on.,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Not worth the cost,

"The hotel has a fantastic location,the view from our incredible bedroom was mind blowing, the bedroom was very large with a large bathroom, which was furnished beautifully. The two restaurants were probably two of the best restaurants in Singapore, one being the best buffet restaurnt I have ever eaten in  , so much choose it is hard to describe. The other restaurant is a michalin star cantonisse restaurant  which is also worth a visit.it is worth knowing they do offer  a special deal for free flow wine and beer , but unfortunately we didn't know about this until the last night",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,World class hotel,

Its definitely a luxury yet comfy stay throughout by the excellence services and great room amenities.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Luxury staycation,
"I recently visited here as I wanted to experience the ultimate service and hotel in Singapore, regrettably the hotel pool was under maintenance and this was not suitable during our stay. The check in was fast and efficient, although we did get a average room on level 5, which was then changed to level 26. The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, and some of the fixtures inside could be replaced due to wear and tear. Overall we cannot wait to return with family and friends to see what changes have been made.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Fabulous staff ,
Just a beautiful property walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino and shopping center.  I was lucky enough to have a club level room (highly recommended) with access to the Club Lounge which was one of the best lounge experience I have ever enjoyed.  The service and food choices in the lounge (and the customer service) was a perfect 10!  Everything about this hotel spelled S E R V I C E! Great attention to detail and my room was just amazing.  I needed a shirt pressed in short order and they came through without hesitation.  The views of Marina Bay were fantastic (no need to leave your room to take pics!).    Obviously not the cheapest of hotels in terms of rate but worth every dollar for sure.  My new favorite hotel in Singapore. I will be back!!,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,What a Hotel!,

"Honestly, the view of this hotel took my breath away. I usually don't like staying in a city hotel during my travels, but boy, this one is an exception. Although in the middle of the city, you won't feel the rush below, but instead, it's like the stars unfold in front of you when you look at the city lights. In a way, the view was calming. Aside from the spectacular view, the staff were excellent, as you would expect from a high end hotel. The food was also delicious and the service we experienced was unparalleled. Highly recommended if you are going to stay in singapore with great budget in hand.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Amazing Place,

"Recently stayed in Suite 2508 (we were upgraded)for 2 nights after a cruise.  When we arrived, we were surprised to see a Ritz-Carlton that was so busy (we found out later the Chinese New Year was the major reason) and large but our concerns were mitigated after we arrived at our room.  Not only was the suite spacious but we had a magnificant view towards the Sands Casino but we could see many of the well known buildings of the city.  The suite had a large sitting room, office and separated bathroom from the one in the bedroom.  It was beautiful.   The breakfast buffet was fabulous.  Anything you could imagine!  The house staff were all kind, polite and very well trained. Also, toured the spa and fitness but did not have opportunity to use.  The facilities there were outstanding.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Oasis incite on steroids,
"Just fantastic. No-one could do enough for our 3-year old. All-day champagne in the lounge. Kids allowed in until 6pm so includes first part of cocktail hour. Deluxe rooms have such a large sofa, it can be made up into a bed. The staff were world-class throughout. I'd like to particularly mention Raj, who made up the sofabed for us.

"So happy I used my points to reserve a Marina Bay view while visiting with my wife and infant daughter. I really appreciated the crib Ritz  provided us. In addition, its location made it easy to visit different parts of the city via cab or uber. I would consider staying here in the future, too. The service from staff was the best I'll ever receive and the in-room dining was always fast and hot.

Excellent hotel in a superb location with the exception of the pool area which was under construction upon our arrival.  We were very dismayed that we were not told that this might be the case.  Check with hotel directly before staying there to make sure construction is complete.  A/C in room is limited and settings cannot be lowered to adequately cool room when facing the sun all day.

"I have stayed in all of the major hotels in Singapore over the past 6 years. This is the best so far. The room was spacious, airy and very well maintained, with all the amenities one could want. The overall decor and ambiance at the hotel is great with an impressive lobby space. The staff were attentive, professional and courteous. The only fault I could find might be the lighting in the bathroom - very minor and trivial relative to the overall experience.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Ritz-Carlton January 2017,

Everyone was very welcoming and helpful from the second we stepped out of the taxi until we were in our room.  The quality of the food in the club room was exceptional.

Very few faults - there was construction at the pool while we were there which would have been nice to know about in advance, but it didn't spoil our stay.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Haven of rest,
Absolutely fantastic stay.  Staff are super attentive and efficient.  Setting is overlooking the harbour for many rooms.  Food was sublime and the general amenities were top class.

Not a bad thing to say about this hotel.  As close to perfect as it can get.....,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Stunning,

"The Ritz Carlton Millenium is a great place to stay. Our room had a jaw dropping view of the Port and City. We had several special requests, and they were handled promptly and expeditiously. Staff is exceptional.   We found breakfast offerings quite nice, but the dinner dining options are fairly limited, and do not match the variety and quality of nearby restaurants like those in the nearby Pan Pacific, for example.   The buffet is scattered about in an unusual layout, and it is quite pricy for those with smaller appetites.   All in all, great place to stay, but you may want to consider other dinner dining options. ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Excellent Rooms, Service, Buffet So/So",

"My husband and I were booked in a club floor room for 5 nights during a convention and we LOVED everything about it. From the view to the awesome bath tub all the way to the exceptional service-it was all TOP NOTCH! The housekeeping staff saw that we loved the mini chocolate bars that they would leave on our bedside during turn down service so they made it a point to leave us a plateful of them every night. At the Ritz, it was all about the little things. We would run every morning and upon our return  the people at the front desk would offer us bottles of water and cold towels to freshen up. I would definitely be back th3 next time I travel for business. Loved every bit of our stay here.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,What a wonderful hotel!,

"Fantastic hotel - more so if you want to be close to the CBD of Singapore. If you're in the city for business, it's very likely your office is within a kilometer's radius so it's a great and convenient location. The view from the top floors is great and the service cannot be faulted. Only downside - they don't participate in the rewards point programs so that's one thing to keep in mind.",4.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Great place to stay,

The Guest Relation correspondant for the day always changes however, they keep updates of the things that were done. I like to thanks other than Germaine, these 2 people as well.

"The room was good with excellent fittings. The club lounge had excellent breakfast and other food and drink service. Overall atmosphere and the restaurants were good.  Disappointed that there was no availability at the spa.   Biggest issue is that despite being called a Ritz Carlton, it doesn't belong to the Ritz Carlton rewards programme, so points are not earned and membership status goes unrecognised. This is a real drawback, particularly as it is not mentioned in advertising. Very misleading and the clear reason not to rate it higher.

What's more, the dedicated staff there made it really memorable with beautiful pink heart shaped balloons sprinkled all over and customised birthday decorations strung across the window when we checked into the room.

Went for a staycation in Dec 2016. I was told it was a '6-star hotel' and hence was expecting a different level of service experience.  But it was no different from the other 5-star hotels around it. I made a special request as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. But they conveniently forgot about my request. That was a big disappointment.  The room and room service was good. The swimming pool is closed for renovation and this is not informed to us earlier. The room overlooking the bay was excellent.

Just a bit difficult to find it when you arrive downstairs...  My only reservation was that check-in was not as efficient as it normally is in Asia. I had to wait quite a bit. The other thing is that the hotel has become a bit older and the room furniture does not feel so modern anymore....  But overall a great experience.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Still great!,

I was expecting a lot from this hotel and it did not fail to deliver.  Paid a premium for the Marina Bay View.  The welcome and service was beyond fault.  With small touches that really made you feel like a welcome guest not just another customer.  The room and view was truly great.  The only quibble being that a night the condensation on the outside of the window obstructed the view.  This might have been a seasonal thing.  We did find a solution which was to close the night shades before going to dinner which acted as a barrier against the cool air inside the room cooling the window glass.  On hesitation in recommending this hotel.,5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Wonderful Experience,

Love every dish Summer Pavilion has provided, will definitely go back next time.

Cantonese dim-sum and Japanese food were not as authentic or tasty as the western food. The staff and atmosphere were great though.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,"Great food, excellent service, friendly staff!",
I have stayed at the Ritz before and loved it.  This time however not so good.  No early checkin as promised when I booked via Singapore airlines and latest checkout 2 pm when flight didn't leave til midnight.  Room 2511 had broken floorboards and staff were not nearly as attentive as last trip where I was in Carlton club.  Some staff on mentoring programs told us they were not happy to be in their roles.  The Peninsula in HK and Beverly Hills seem to have an edge over Ritz.  When one spends this much in a hotel they expect the absolute best certainly not broken floors and unhappy staff.  We love this hotel and particularly love the senior concierge the only staff member that acknowledged we were repeat customers,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Disappointed with the Ritz,

We can't say enough about the staff, especially an intern named Suzi, who really went the extra mile to accommodate our every need. The Club Level staff is ever present in the most positive of ways. The only challenge was that the pool and spa are undergoing renovations - which we didn't know about until arriving at the facility. Additionally, they are not equipped to handle guests with kosher dietary needs.

It was our first time overseas with her and the Four Seasons made it a lot easier with baby products unexpected but all provided. Service and luxury are all standard at this hotel as you would expect. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A Thoughtful Experience,

"The property was extremely comfortable matched by top notch service.  They helped us start our 3 day journey off right with a very early check in straight from a red eye flight.  The redone rooms were exquisite in a minimalist way with a high floor view.  We just felt so at home, especially given the attention they gave to the comfort of our 2yr old.

This is by far the best venue to hold a meeting or a conference in Singapore rn. Michelle was a great coordinator and planner before the event. And Fandi was the best onsite person ever.

Will definitely do more events in this hotel again.   ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best venue to host a meeting in Singapore ,
"Four seasons Singapore is a truly exceptional hotel. Large rooms, exquisite washrooms, supremely comfortable beds, polite and prompt service and amazing attention to detail.  The breakfast is great if you are a non vegetarian and love cold cuts.  There is an ice machine on every floor which is super convenient.  The bathroom toiletries are L'occitane and the bathrooms are super comfortable and large.  The staff is very well trained and the customer service standards are really high.  It is a short walk from the famed Orchard road.   I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Exceptional !!!,
"My first time in Singapore in over 10 years. I decided to try the Four Seasons and it was a delightful stay from the very start. I was upgraded to a lovely room. Everything about this hotel is good, reception, the bar, doormen and the wonderful concierge team who re as lly helped me out when s slight crisis occured. The only negative remark was the breakfast service with highly stressed staff and not at the same standard as at the bar. All in all a terrific stay.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful stay,
"The hotel is located near orchard road. You have to walk a bit until you find the main orchard area and it's not close to any MRT station. So I can't say it convinient. But if you travel by taxi it would be convinient and easy to get taxi.   The hotel is a bit dated but room got renovated and so comfy. Breakfast was a bit too average and not so many variety, i can say a bit disappointed.    Every staffs were polite , four seasons standard. Got a promo for 3 pay 2 and it was very worth. Nevery doubt to come back again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay,
"If we stay at Singapore for travel from Oz to anywhere, we used to choose Marina Bays Sands usually. This was the first time we stayed here and we felt so good that we will definitely be back here. The hotel fits all standard necessary checklists for 5 star, however, the experience is made special by staff. I rarely had such a good experience with staff while having breakfast... Charlie was phenomenally good and friendly with our toddlers. Overall, a way more warm hospitality experience. Finally, on the last day, as we had late night flights, reception easily extended our stay without fuss for half day.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Amazing experience and sure to come back for,
"Stay clear of this one. This is a Super 8 dressed up as a Four Seasons. Staff was confused and rude and very inexperienced. Concierge had no local knowledge whatsoever, he/she sent us to closed restaurants, closed attractions, it was absolutely unacceptable. Hotel condition was run down, paint on the door hinges, towel rack wobbling on the wall, toilet seat crooked, dated furnishings, stains of our sofa, the list goes on and on. Waste of money. Only thing going for it is the location in Orchard. This hotel and how we were treated there has made us not want to return to Singapore.",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This is the worst Four Seasons Hotel we have ever stayed at.,
"It's a great hotel , lovely location and amenities. Room sizes, bath and sleep quality were perfect.  But somehow lacks the personal touch and bereft of the warmth that you would usually associate with a hotel of this class.  Was left to wonder until we asked about facilities, they had a great restaurant but got to know too late. Not being picky but just that one would expect a better level of service with a hotel this class. ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Lacking the personal touch,
"Check in time was 3 pm and they could not accomodate me even 15 minutes before that despite the fact that half the rooms were empty. Also when we checked in there was no introduction to services available at the Hotel. No one came with us to the room to brief us about the facilities either. There were a lot of smiles and gestures but there was no warmth is what i felt. There was no personal touch in the room either. No fruit, not even a simple cookie and thats surprising for a hotel of this standard.  With great reluctance they extended our check out by 90 minutes. The door men are courteous and efficient. There is nothing in this property that will take me back there again.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Unremarkable stay,

Lovely pet amenities and great service from hotel staffs The view wasn't that great as it was facing the construction site but the room was big enough for our furkid to run and move about, which made us to forget the view Nice breakfast - we had it at outdoor area. Maybe a suggestion - possible for to make netted fences to prevent birds coming to the outdoor dining area. I realised our dogs and few other dog owners felt abit uncomfy for the birds keep coming in which disturb our breakfast time.

"I travelled to Singapore from Melbourne via the VTL, with my daughter. The 4 Season hotel made this a wonderful experience. They provided inexpensive ART (RAT) tests for us and made booking anything easy with their app via the chat link. Both the pools were lovely and we were given extra time to use these facilities. Room service was great as was the bar for cocktails and satays. ION shopping mall is a short stroll and has a fantastic food court on B4 level. Check in and out were uncomplicated and all the staff were efficient and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for all VTL travellers.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Travel during VTL,
I stay several hotel but didn't experience confusing upon check out day. Need check thru apps n call front desk to ensure didn't over the timing. Poor experience on second times although hotel is really comfortable to stay. When enjoy breakfast is nobody to let you know what to do n which selection you may consider. Maybe first stay experience on Four season is too wonderful so I expectation high. Although second trip need worth $600+ but is not worthy when I choose between Four Season n Mandarin Oriental Hotel choice.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Different experience on every stay,

"Hotel is near the shops of Orchard Road.  Ad you'd expect hotel has great spacious and clean rooms, the gym facilities are lovely  (as is pool area).  The differentiator with other five stars - is the service - the service at other places is great  -but the four seasons does it just slightly better - they anticipate what you want before you ask  - they follow up ideal queries - they notice that you have a gluten intolerance (wife) and make sure that gluten free alternative are on hand.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Service is exceptional as usual,

Pros: Kids friendly, pet friendly, easily accessible and ample F&B options nearby. Friendly staff added that personal touch which made us feel unique and not as if we were just another guest.  Cons: bed was too soft, which we told the staff after our 1st night and they worked some magic on it making it much better on our 2nd and 3rd night.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best staycation ever,

We opted for the Premier room and was impressed, the room is lovely and spacious and comes with daybed. The pools were so so but it's ok. We were surprised that the breakfast is not an ala carte buffet type but a normal buffet. The options were limited but food quality is great. We loved the bak kut teh.  They even have a coffee machine that has great coffee options like capuccino, latte, flat white, near the  check in counters where one can just take coffee at their convenience.

"Visited the Four Seasons hotel for the first time.  Attended by front desk staff Ellie and she was attentive. Requested for late check-out and was granted 2pm check-out. Super grateful as we had conference that stretched from morning to noon.  Interior of hotel room was well maintained - toilet, bedding. However the coffee machine in the room was producing dirty cloudy coffee water when I tried to used it. Not sure how it's been maintained. The TV was huge. We were able to mirror our Apple devices and watched YouTube/Safari videos. Netflix is not possible though.  Restaurant had limited choices for breakfast. The food was alright.

I feel the services were top level, and we were enjoying so much our stay there.

They treated our dog like a family member and we respect them for that.

"Our two main takeaways from this staycation was how massive the rooms were, and how personable the service is. Let's just say that the Four Seasons Singapore is hiring all the right people, because we were very impressed with all the staff we interacted with - Yani from the operator, Jean, Gigi and Alex from front office, Chenin from the spa, and more. Thank you to Aisyah for arranging the late checkout for us also...!   We were shocked at how generous the layout of the rooms are, absolutely no space was spared in the design.

"Among all the local hotels which I have stayed, I dare say that Four Seasons Hotel has the best gym amongst all. In my list, Ritz Carlton's ranks second. Haven't found a third yet cos Conrad, Pan Pacific, St Regis, Capella and MBS's gym ain't even close.  The room is definitely comfortable and I liked how the toilet also has ceiling speaker installed. You are definitely not missing out in the show if you have to be in the toilet. Also, there's Airplay capability in the room TV, something which many others do not have. Breakfast wise, not as great as St Regis's but not too bad.  Overall, really amazing property.

This feels like a top notch hotel. Dealing with the front desk and the concierge was super easy. The concierge understood what we asked for and got us what we were looking for.  We got an upgrade on the room and got a room that seemed to have been very recently refurbished. Nicely decorated and comfortable. The only drawback was a quite poor hairdryer and the make-up mirror seemed to have been left over since before the refurbishment.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel.  The gym seemed to be brand new but the changing rooms in particular the gents seemed a bit old.  This was my first experience with a Four Seasons hotel and I will be sure to be looking out for a Four Seasons hotel on future trips.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top notch,

Also at time of writing (November 19) it has a pretty major construction site next door that looks like it will be active for at least a year. I got a room facing away and didnt notice any noise, but it'd be worth avoiding if you can I think.

You have main spots walking distance and also bus and tube very close.  The room is big with all details also in the bathroom. Also the breakfast is really good. You have different kind of products and meals to choose from and the environment is really nice. I had an issue with my flight, it was delayed for 6 hours and the person in concierge help me to change the flight talking directly to the airline and managed to get another flight and connection so I could arrive home on time. I would like to say spacial thanks to Rachell Yne who was on the phone and got to change the reservation of my flight.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great hotel to stay in Singapore,
"Four Seasons brand exudes luxury and this one is no different. Classic decor public areas with spacious, functional and very well designed modern rooms. Bose soundlink iii was provided if you need to crank up your music. Staffs were excellent as well. Located at quiet spot behind Orchard, you'll need a little walk to reach the shopping belt. Only couple of minutes to get to Wheelock then you can enjoy the underground access to ION or TANG areas. The hotel also has an indoor access to Hilton that serves as an alternate route to get to main Orchard road. Will definitely return but I would skip the breakfast buffet unless it's for convenience.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great classic hotel in a quiet spot of Orchard,
"I spent three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore.  Once again, I had an excellent stay. I was pleased to see that the service and quality remains high under the new GM. The Four Seasons remains my go-to hotel in Singapore.   Staff are all courteous and welcoming, the refurbished rooms are very nice. The refurbished gym is great. The breakfast buffet remains a highlight (please maintain the quality and variety of offerings!). And the location is top notch.   I look forward to my next stay here. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Another excellent stay,
Unsurpassed service and quality from the hotel. The rooms which have been recenlty refurbished are in great condition and the staff and service are top notch. Breakfast and the bar are great points of the day for a businees or leisure traveller.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Four Seasons, Singapore",
"We loved our stay at this hotel. The room was beautiful, the service impeccable. The Four Seasons really makes a difference in service, is right above the rest! The hotel is very well maintained.  The only minus was the breakfast, that we found was below that of other 5 start hotels in Singapore like the Mandarin Oriental for example. It does detract from the ambience that the restaurant has no natural light.  Still, I would happily be back!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent stay,
"Breakfast buffet is nice and generous but not all the time, the guests could come down to have it due to age, mobility, health or lack of time. In my case, I had wasn't feeling well, called the frontdesk if I could just have a breakfast plate in my room. But they said that only the buffet is available. I stay in hotels often and most of them offer in-room breakfast if the guest is not able to go to the buffet. Otherwise, this hotel is clean and has good location.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,No options for breakfast,
"This hotel exemplifies everything great about the best Four Seasons properties.  Every aspect of our stay was perfect - greeted on arrival with toys for the children before we'd even alighted from the car, whisked to our upgraded room for check-in, where we found heartwarming welcome notes written for my wife and the girls on the mirrors.    All staff were happy, friendly and professional and helpful.  The rooms are very fresh as they've recently completed a full refurb.  We will definitely return to the Four Seasons Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Superb Four Seasons Property,

A friend and I checked in for one night only at the Singapore Four Seasons at the end of a holiday in Singapore.  We were both impressed we both received name acknowledgment every where we were in the hotel. The decor in the rooms was delightful and the room was very spacious. I have never experienced such personalised and attentive service that is in no way intrusive or ingratiating. I hope to be able to experience more of the Four Season brand of hospitality.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Service beyond any other experiences,
I still cant understand why this hotel cant be lifted to 6 star instead of a 5 STAR status. The staff will go over and beyond at all times to assist. They are Genuine and truly love working in a environment that is second to none and is evident with every conversation i have with them. I often tell friends and family pay a little extra and always stay at a four seasons hotel or resort as they do bring you the WOW factor.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Beyond all expectations,

"We booked ourselves into the basic category room overlooking the famous Orchard Road and couldn't have been more pleased with both the view and the size of the room. We had heard that accommodations in Singapore, like in Europe, tend to be on the smaller side. The beds were very comfy and it was nice having a decent sized bathroom for the room category that we were in. The hotel also has a lovely pool with some great poolside staff that make sure you are well hydrated at all times. We had a very enjoyable stay at the Four Seasons and can easily see ourselves coming back to this hotel on our next visit to Singapore",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Spacious!!,

Breakfast buffet is the best anywhere.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,I travel all over the world and this is one of my favorite hotels.,
"Very helpful staff, large airy room. Adult only pool option.   We didn't eat breakfast so no idea if it's any good, but we had drinks in the bar a couple of evenings and the service was really good.   The rooftop pool is really small, I honestly think that one should be the adults one and the larger one should be for families.  The location is excellent for getting into the city and the Big Bus stops across the road.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great Staff, spacious room",

It may not be the newest but it is still my favourite hotel in Singapore. The location is fantastic being so close to Orchard Rd; the public areas are beautiful and the rooms luxurious and spacious. The staff are professional and friendly ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best hotel in Singapore,
"Had a wonderful stay.   Pros -comfortable rooms, big enough -breakfast buffet is great; that's the only meal we tried there -convenient location; very short walk to the action on orchard -Friendly staff: Housekeeping left a note saying they noted that I hadn't slept well and had changed pillows and duvet for me. That kind of felt creepy. Don't know whether to put that under pros or cons!  Cons -None  I had trouble deciding between Marina Bay Sands and the Four Seasons. If it's your first time in Singapore maybe stay at Marina Bay to get the whole ""experience"", otherwise Four Seasons is a good choice ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Comfortable, friendly, convenient",
Corporate rate of S$300/night without tax didn't include breakfast. Not many local breakfast places in the vicinity.  Hotel is old but well kept. Room is clean and huge but water heater is slow reacting. Bed is abit too soft for my taste. Room service is prompt. Food is average. Staff is generally polite but the check out service is rather slow.  Gym is decent sized. Wifi can get choppy at peak hours. ,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not fantastic ,
"Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making our first stay in Singapore truely memorable. They were so attentive with our needs, celebrated our anniversary and helped us with any questions we had about getting around. We cannot wait to return to the Four Seasons and continue exploring Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A truely wonderful stay,
"We stayed in a king room which was supposedly an upgrade, however seemed like a standard king room. The finishes were excellent, with thought and detail going into each element of the room. I did notice, however, that the building has air conditioning issues which is leading to musty smells in the rooms and a wet feeling due to humidity. The vents in the hallways were dripping with condensation causing some damage on the floors. Otherwise, I would say this is an excellent hotel, although not much to distinguish it as a Four Seasons. The breakfast buffet was amazing, and the food and service at the restaurant was wonderful.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons Singapore,
"My family stayed in two rooms, one Deluxe and one Premier. Premier room had more room and allowed for an extra rollaway bed with ample space. Room is of high quality and very comfortable. Breakfast was good with Western and limited but good Chinese and Japanese selection. Easily grabbed Grab taxis and with walking distance to many malls and restaurants. Would easily return for another stay.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great facilities and service,
"The hotel is central,modern with newly renovated rooms.

The beds are very big and extremely comfortable.  The staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel,
"It's not cheap to stay here, but it is worth every cent.  My room is large, quiet, has everything I need.  The staff here could not be more helpful or obliging.  The location is good for keen Orchard Rd shoppers.  Slightly confusing to walk back here due to extensive building works!  Food excellent, room service terrific.  Two decent pools with helpful attendants.  Note  the one on the 3rd floor gets no sun due to tall buildings all around it.  the one on the 20th floor however does get sun. I  am thankful for the air conditioning as Singapore is v hot and terribly humid.  I would stay here again in a  heartbeat!  This is not a hotel for those seeking trendiness or modernity but if you like quiet comfort then this is for you",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This comfortable hotel ticks all the boxes,
Stayed here after a number of years in June.    The good bits  - fantastic location   - recently refurbished rooms with very high standards ala four seasons style.    - room service very good  - the bar is well stocked and upto 9 pm they service complimentary food - cheese nuts bread etc  The not so good  - breakfast has limited choices and quality of food is wanting.  Breakfast is in a windowless room with below average service  - There is no other eating option in the hotel  - the lounge is old and tired.   - the pool is small and very poorly maintained.  service is non existent.   - rooms over look a construction site,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Refurbished rooms but everything else is tired,
"The Four seasons Singapore is an elegant, quiet and well appointed hotel. We have been visiting for nearly 15 years now.... and we do not hesitate at staying always At FS because the service, cleanness and tranquility never changes",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The only hotel in Singapore!,
"I really appreciated how the location is still central enough to be walking distance from Orchard Road, but far enough that the noise levels aren't a factor (as compared to some of the hotels on Orchard Rd or Scotts Rd)  Room was large (especially by Singapore standards), hotel staff were all friendly and eager to help. Two thumbs up!  Only slight inconsistency is that I got fresh fruits throughout my first stay, but none on my second stay half a week later :(",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, surprisingly large room",
"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Singapore.

The rooms were lovely and the hotel lived up to its reputation as a top-notch hotel with excellent service.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful home-base in Singapore,
"I have stayed here many times over the years.  I like the location near Orchard road and appreciate the personal service the hotel gives.   With all the new hotels being built closer to downtown, I thought that this hotel would have suffered a bit in business, but clearly people still come, attracted by the four seasons brand.  We upgraded to a small suite as we were staying for a whole week, and did not regret it.  Another fabulous four seasons experience. One more thing:  concierge service seemed to not be en par with a typical four seasons. When my wife asked for a place to get a pedicure, they first pointed her to the Four Seasons spa (which doesn't do pedicures), and then told her they ""don't know any place to recommend"")  Sees a bit lame",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Still my favorite in Singapore.  Service is hard to beat,
"Have stayed here multiple times each year over the last few years and theyre always the most helpful, personal and genuine staff.

For solo or couples - this is the best possible hotel in SG.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best service in SG,

"As always the Four Seasons does not disappoint! The property is located in the quieter part of Singapore on Orchard Blvd. Walking distance to the Singapore Botanical gardens and plenty of excellent shopping and food. Easy and close to Little India and Chinatown. Download Grab and get a S$11 ride to the Marina Bay Area - only 15 minutes away. Hotel staff were welcoming and so gracious and helpful. The rooms are very large and well appointed. It is a beautiful, very tasteful property with understated elegance. The breakfast was included and was superb.

"I don't need to write to any of you that the beds, linens, pillows are world class or that the views are spectacular or that the TV repair guy came within two minutes of my call.  Nor do I need to remind anyone of the fine art and chic/elegent furnishings.  What blew me away this time is that when I came back to my room after a day of exercise (as seen in the photos I posted) not only was the room spotless (to be expected) but that the cleaning ladies had neatly tied up all my phone and computer cords and I found a new book marker in my book with a handwritten note from the cleaning lady, ""Dear Mr. Cantwell, Here's a book mark to help you keep track of your reading.  Happy Reading.  Your room attendant, Tlew Sing""  Nuff said!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Yup, Another Great Four Seasons",
"We stayed at the Four Seasons on a business trip for 5 days and it was first class all around.  Breakfast was a great buffet with some changes each day. On the second day they already knew what each of us preferred for coffee or tea.  Fitness is very good too, as is the blue hour at the bar.  We found dinner to be extremely good too. Again they knew our wishes and needs. Rooms were spacious, the beds first class...  there was nothing to complain and I mean nothing.  Even the Spa is very good for a business hotel.  We enjoyed it very much. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top notch,
"GWP and Shangri-la cannot come close to the service we received at Four Seasons Hotel. We were blessed to have Eddric and Affandi to manage our wedding! I am no bridezilla but I had a typical big fat Greek wedding kind of wedding to plan. They both had the patience of saints when dealing with us and our families. Both were so sincere in their advice and help.   One (out of many) moments that truly touched my heart was when Affandi  came to offer me bedroom slippers right after the dancing. My feet were sore, but even before I could say anything he was there with he bedroom slippers and a bag to hold my shoes. If ever one decides to have their wedding...I wouldn't think twice if it is with Four Seasons",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,By far the BEST!! Wedding,
The Four Seasons Singapore is a delight. Tucked away close to Orchard Road. Has a very personal feel as its small and compact. Rooms are immaculate and a good size. Very nice bar and the main restaurant is pretty good also. For a genuine 5 star its also reasonably priced for what they offer.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Lovely hotel,
"This is my wife's favorite restaurant near Orchard Road.  Very calm upscale 5 star hotel that serve as the perfect respite from the heat and crazyness of Orchard Road.  Huge room with everything you need for leisure and business.  We've stayed twice, both times with a boulevard view which is calming enough while doing paperwork.    Staff is attentive and responsive.  Anything is possible, though may be a little expensive.  However, it is the premier business and shopping location in SG. Will certainly repeat.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Favorite Hotel Near Orchard Road,
"It was the first time I chose a Four Seasons hotel for one of our stays abroad. Besides its perfect location (near the Orchard Road), the hotel owns two great restaurants. The kid really enjoyed the pool area on 20th floor, right on top of the hotel. I had no time to try the spa, but the spa area also looks really cool. Apart from that, the staff is simply lovely.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,My first Four Seasons experience,
"I have never felt dissapointed of Four Seasons. The same stands for Four Seasons Singapore. The experience is excellent. Even the guests are gentle and discreet. The hotel us over 20years old, but you don't see it anywhere. The staff is welcoming and efficient. Even using the guest's name comes up naturally. The location is the best; very near to Orchard Road and you can walk to the most imporatnt spots. In short: Fully Recommended.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons as Always,
The Four Seasons staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.

Very good location which is next to Ion Orchard. The hotel looks old be the room is very well renovated and nice. Best is the swimming pool with Jacuzzi. You will get a peach tea & towel when just sit down the sun-chair which is amazing. Quick check in & check out. Housekeeping really cares to the detail. I just requested for ice bucket for the first day and I got it everyday without request. What an amazing service. Highly recommend Four-season Singapore ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good hotel,

"Recently stayed at this property for four nights with my wife and daughter. Really enjoyed the renovated suite and services overall. Friendly and caring staff especially in restaurants. Food in one-ninety is well prepared, not complicated and good value for money IMO. Pool area on the 20th floor can use some improvement, small shallow pool, limited seats and drinks come from bar in ground floor which is not entirely efficient. Hotel should consider to open ground floor pool for families. Surrounding area is a bit rough at night not suitable for families after dark. Minor complain I thought I was awarded a complementary late check out but discovered a half day's charge on my bill after I received it by email. Will stay again on our next visit,",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nicely renovated property with high standard of service,
The flowers in the entry way are just gorgeous. The front desk people are so helpful. The room was beautiful with a fine view. The Michelin one star restaurant was truly good. I arrived very early in the morning and the staff could not have been more welcoming even at such an early hour. I also had to leave on a very early flight and once again everyone was just so helpful. I had a spa facial and a spa massage. Both were quite good. I celebrated my birthday and the staff was so celebratory. I loved when they asked me 'when will I return'!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Stunning Service,

"Newly refurbished rooms with super comfortable beds.  One thing that I found annoying is coming back to stuffy room after a hot day.    Maybe because of some sort of eco friendly a/c system but every time we came back to the room, the a/c was always set to a low setting the room was always stuffy.   One thing I found interesting was that is seemed like they copy and pasted the room design for the new Four Seasons Seoul as it almost looks identical.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Nice, but could be better.",

This is obvious by the nature and quality of the service which is considerate and efficient. We were there during Chinese New Year and service at breakfast did struggle a bit but this was more due to large families arriving and being rather demanding.

We stayed here at the end of January.  It's a nice hotel with lovely rooms but the concierge are not very knowledgeable and that makes it hard to get advice on where to go etc.  Don't recommend the overpriced Chinese Restaurant.  I'm not sure how it got a Michelin Star because it really is very ordinary.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice Hotel.  Lovely Rooms. Not so great Concierge,

"Without a doubt, Four Seasons, Singapore, is a class above. It is a 5 star hotel with a boutique feel.  There is nothing I can fault, from the front desk, to housekeeping, to the barman.

"We stayed here on both legs of our trip. Both stays were perfect. We booked through Four Seasons and got a 3 for 2 deal, which was nice. On arrival, we were offered a breakfast deal, which was not particularly cheap but we were so glad we took it. We've stayed in luxury hotels in many countries, but this was by far the most amazing hotel breakfast we've ever had. The variety of Western and Asian foods was just unbelievable. I'm a baker and even the fresh sourdough bread was fantastic.   The room was very large (SO rare in Singapore) and of course the location near Orchard Road and the MRT Is fantastic. We slept perfectly.  The only disappointment was our dinner at the Chinese restaurant, which I will review separately.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,really top class,
"Having stayed here on numerous occasions it feels like coming home,the staff are very accommodating and genuinely seemed happy to welcome me back.

The Check in was delayed but the check-in agent took my mobile phone number and informed us straightaway when one of the room was ready unlike at Mandarin Oriental Marina Bay who kept us waiting for 2 hours then only acted when I threatened to cancel my reservation ( an apology was made later by the hotel management ) . The breakfast was nice and pleasant . The staff in particular our waiter , Tamil and the restaurant manager , Ivan were friendly . The rooms ( cheapest category) were luxurious and large . We are definitely coming back to the Four Seasons again and recommend our fellow travellers to do the same",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice boutique hotel in quiet location,
"The hotel is a stone throw away from the glamorous Orchard Street, quiet and accessible. The rooms and public area is maintained well in a timeless decor. I quite like the non intrusive service of the hotel initially, though after 3 days upon approaching the front desk we were still unnoticed is kind of surprising. It is a good experience for any business hotel, but with the Four Seasons brand name, we kind of expected a bit more.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pre CNY getaway,
"They ruined all the magic by taking 1000 SGD deposit without even telling me. They took this deposit from my bank account very fast, the same day we checkin, but they now claim it'll take 10 business days to give it back to me. The problem is that 1) they did that without mentioning it 2) this is an extra headache to look after now with some phone calls and emails and bank account checks. Extra headache is the exact opposite of what I expect when I go enjoy a nice hotel with family.",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Headache not peaceful,
"My top hotel choice for trips to Singapore.  The renovated rooms are modern, clean, and spacious. And moreover, the staff go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and cared for.  For instance, the staff remembered that I'd commented on their pillows being too soft during my last stay.  When I arrived in my room, firm pillows had been prepared, and they made all the difference to my sleep quality.  ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Home away from home,

I have 50 years of international travel experiences all over the world, and I can truly write that the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore exceeded my expectations, especially for location with limited and very expensive space.  The manager of the hotel as well as all the staff treated us royally.  I highly recommend the Four Season Hotel Singapore !!!  More than 5 stars !

It was nice that our room was upgraded by the hotel during the F1 weekends as the hotel rooms have been overbooked. The suite room is spacious with one bed room and in the corner overlooking views of the city with open scenery. The outdoor swimming pool and the next indoor gym however look outdated and have not been upgraded for many years. Adequate equipments but reminded me the ages of this property.  The location of Four Seasons is slightly far away from the busy F1 event hence the traffic has not been too bad.  ,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Adequate stay ,

"I visit Singapore regularly and always stay on Orchard Road. However, this time I decided to stay here due to the fact that my usual hotel is getting too crowded and was becoming just a number. However, this is not the case at the Four Seasons. The staff is lovely and the hotel is small enough to feel intimate, despite the fact it's Four Seasons. Hands down, my nicest experience staying here amongst the hordes of other hotels. I will be returning shortly....",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect for a city hotel!,
I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. A really good 5* hotel.  The service by all the staff is very attentive.  Just to mention 2 things: the wifi not so strong all the time in the room. In my opinion the breakfast is overpriced and there are many options outside.  Despite those 2 things I highly recommend this hotel.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pleasant surprise ,
"We came for a few days. The rooms are nice. And service is good. But. We just visited four seasons Seoul, snd there us nothing to compare. It us not as good. First, few times they did not come for turn down service , efrngjough the sign.eas on. Everytime we had to.adk for more soap. We got 2 bananas in the room the whole week. Better they wouldn't give anything. The service in the pool is limited and they font go atop d with some special things to make it fun (go to fukkeryon bay and kesrn) So all in all it was ok, but MIT more than that for this class of hotel. But no.mistajes, the hotel us good and people are friendly and helpful.  It just lacks the extra.you expect. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A nice stay but jit as other 4 seasons ,
Wow! What a blessing to be well treated while traveling with children! As anyone who does travel with children knows...the experience is challenging enough and not very much fun without friendly faces! You can sure find them at Four Seasons Orchard in Singapore! From the unending graciousness of Ivan Martinez who hosts the dining room to Gladys and Sean in the conscierge services we could not have been treated more like family! In addition the food and accommodations were outstanding and it was fabulously located in the middle of everything!!!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top of the top customer service and kid friendly,

Beds v high quality (reminded me of Buneos Aires one).  Highly recommended.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Views & Central,
We went here for my husband's birthday. Everything was top notch. The spa staff even sang happy birthday and gave him a rich piece of cake.  The concierge assisted with contacting our choice of restaurant. The room was divine with a very spacious bathroom and a great city view. I like that there was an adult pool as well as one that was for kids.  Our massages were very top notch and booked on the same day. I was very sad to leave.  ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Just wonderful,

"Been to several five star hotel in Singapore, but have to admin four season still the best one in term of service. The housekeeping offer my mouse a pad with a very very lovely note, you can tell this come from a professional training, a small touch but that speak alot. The breakfast is  the besy breakfast, compare to intercontinental, pan pacific or shangrila. The hotel maybe old, but the service is never out of style",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent,
"I really liked this hotel very much;  Four Seasons is probably the best chain of hotels around for a reason.  Amazing beds, which one can purchase by the way.  Big room and the front desk could not do enough for us throughout our stay.  Two very average swimming pools were kind of odd.  Very good breakfast, as is typical for the Four Seasons;  As another reviewer put it, this hotel is really solid and nice, but without a wow factor--not really unique in any way, save for really good service and comfort if that makes sense.  It seemed a bit outdated in some ways, though I did really enjoy the hotel.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very nice hotel; outstanding service and very good location;  Nothing super special though;,

"The new refurbished room has given a new contemporary feel and more comfy.

"Stay three nights at four seasons this week to attend a conference. The building is not the most modern at first glance, probably because it has been there for long enough. My check in was pretty smooth and was given a room on higher floor, as I like it. Pretty good room size and the feel is exactly what a luxury hotel should be. Everything in the room Elias perfect.  Breakfast buffet is quite elaborate with multiple choice for international, Asian and INDIAN food. Extremely courteous staff, willing to help whenever needed.

We cannot reccommend this hotel highly enough, you will not be disappointed.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Outstanding stay,
Can't wait to get back here and be pampered by the lush rooms and delicious food.  I have to mention the breakfast spread that was absolutely perfect.

Did not use the TV or internet that much as Singapore city itself has so much that it does not let you enjoy the hotel completely. Despite this, the hotel was par excellence. Food and beverages need to have more authentic and variety of south Asian cuisines namely North Indian. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four seasons Singapore,

The highest standards are set by the Four Seasons Singapore!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful stay,

Room was newly renovated and had great temperature and a wonderfull bed. Slept very well all my night here.  Gym was maybe not up to date on equioment.   Food selection and quality was as expedted at FS.  The reason i dont give it 5/5 is that it does not give the same grand feeling that imo many FS hotels gives. Lobby is a bit small and has low ceilings.

Gym was excellent, with plenty of weight machines as well as aerobic options, overlooking a trapezoidal-like pool that could be used for lap swimming.  Room was pretty nice, with L'Occitane bathroom amenities and comfortable bedsheets.    The only downer was, an a la carte glass of orange juice cost S$16 for room service.  This is highway robbery, especially when the particular breakfast meal option didn't include a fruit juice beverage.

I will give high marks for many of the staff...the lady that manages the top level pool, the pastry chef...she is lovely and that takes me to the breakfast, just fantastic.

"My friend and I went to the Four Seasons for high tea, it was a bit disappointing as in Australia you get your savory food first but we got the sandwiches first cakes next the savory again then sweet again. The sandwiches were terrific and we has 4 types and the lovely waitress came back 3 times, then came the cakes they were very nice, but to have savory after cakes was strange. All through we could have as much coffee and tea as we wanted, but we were shocked when we were told the price as there are extra charges included on the bill and I feel that when its advertised it should be mentioned the other charges that must be payed so you know the exact price of the indulgence.

"The hotel, as all four seasons typically are, was great. Service impeccable and location amazing, right in the heart of Orchard Road. The rooms are a little tired in spots (particularly technology) but still very very good. We were informed that there was a renovation programme underway and am sure the hotel will be even more amazing post-March 2018.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, will be even better after refurb",
"Very good hotel in convenient location. Only downside was the front door bell staff that was mixed. Some treated me with great courtesy, some did not. I believe it was because I was going to/from office in casual wear. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Hotel,
"The lounge opens in the afternoon albeit the restaurant closed. Needless to say the decoration is glamour, well designed to provide a pleasant and quiet ambience for business discussion or family reunion. Certainly staff are well trained to serve and meet customer's demands. Its MOCHA is recommendable. Smooth and tasteful. Snacks are ok, such as: chips with cheese, French fries but too common, no unique attractive items. Accessibilty is good only for people who drive or who like to walk.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,What a place,
"Very nice and welcoming staffs at reception and restaurant. I stayed there for business and did not have the chance to try the facilities. I understand the hotel is currently under renovation and it's needed to update the rooms, but my room not renovated was already very nice, and I loved the bed.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent staff & excellent bed,

"You will get what you can expect from a 5-star hotel like Four Seasons. Perfect Services, excellent rooms, good Spa, good Restaurants, great Breakfast Buffet. Location wise I wouldn't choose a location around Orchard as the first choice because besides of shopping Orchard road isn't the place to be. And it is also not best located for business meetings. Don't get me wrong, it will take in Singapore max. 15 minutes with the taxi anyway. When it is rainy, you have to wait quite a bit for taxis there, so you better book your land transport in advance.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top Hotel at Orchard Road,
Excellent service from the staff. Nothing was an issue. Service with a smile. Great location of the hotel near the biggest shopping mall and also metro station. Rooms are good size. Pool was great with one being at the top of the roof and the other on 3rd floor.   All in all impressed with the service and attention to detail. ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent service,
"I have always had fantastic stays at this hotel in Singapore. The rooms are large and tastefully decorated (a bit more on the 'classic' side than the modern Asian decor the newest hotels tend to use), with large bathrooms and good views. The two swimming pools offer enough space that they are never too crowded, and I love the location just off Orchard, near Tanglin, rather than in the CBD. Service is excellent.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Classic Luxury Hotel in Singapore,
Have stayed in this property for years and always happy with the experience. The friendliness and professionality of the staff make all the difference. The room is very comfortable; with the bed that helps a lot for a good night rest. The bathroom is spacey enough with great pick of amenities. The food and beverage served is another plus point. Seems impossible to find a reason to be dissatified! ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Always a Wonderful Stay,
"The hotel is located just 2 minutes walking from Orchard Road hence its terrific location for anyone who is in Singapore whether tourism or business. Room was large, bath was nice, bed/mattress very comfortable for good night's sleep. Decor was old world and nice but still hotel is under renovation and rooms are being modernised. But I had no inconvenience in my room and was very happy with everything. Breakfast is just about okay, nothing special or great. Staff especially the reception, concierge and people at the gate were all excellent. Hotel definitely worth returning to.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Friendly staff, excellent location",
"We stayed here for 8 days and we loved coming back to the hotel every single day after a tiring sightseeing. The rooms are lovely , lighted and huge. I have a toddler and they had a children's menu which was wonderful. Swimming pool was great . But more than that the service was top notch. In fact we left our wallet with money while checking out and they actually took the trouble of finding it, sending pictures of it and wiring the money. I don't think you can expect more than that. Whenever we travel to Singapore even for a day we wont think of staying anywhere else.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Most amazing place,
Hotel is old and I was given old room. The room is dated and One of the chair in the room was broken. I wasn't informed there is four season apps. Breakfast was average and lunch as well. Nothing special at all ,1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not impressive and worthed,
Amazing service and beautiful hotel. Guest services even went the extra mile to set up a play tent for my daughter and write her name welcoming her to the hotel on the mirror and draw a little teddybear for her. The stuffed animal Lion that was complimentary at the hotel was not available when we stayed so the hotel went the extra step and actually asked for our address and mailed it to us after our stay. This is the only hotel that we would ever stay at in Singapore.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent service beautiful gem of a hotel,
"I am not sure how, but on a second visit, the staff remembered my name at breakfast!  Good memories I suppose, but more importantly this is one of the finest hotels in Asia. I love the pool, the breakfast and the very exceptional service from front door, to front desk to room service. And the pool is so nice I will mention it twice.  ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good Memories,
"The Four Seasons do traditional luxury well, from service to bedding, restaurants to transport. The FS Singapore is no exception - I was greeted warmly by all the staff, my bags were whisked up to my room upon arrival and the room was always looking great with the help of housekeeping twice a day.  Highlights include the fantastic breakfast spread, being able to freshen up in the spa/gym changerooms before my late night flight and the premium taxi that they had waiting for me once I was ready for the airport. Nothing was too much trouble throughout my stay...",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A true luxury stay,
"Four Seasons Hotel is one of the best hotels in Singapore.  Very close to Orchard Road, very few hotels has the convenience, as well as the quietness.  Not only that, but the staff were very helpful.  Concierge service does help in restaurant booking and recommendations.  Even after we have checked out, we can use their shower and lounge area for a good rest.  Only wish that Four Seasons group has a membership recognition program.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,One of the best hotels in Singapore,
"This property is too old and dated with worn out carpets, rooms and furniture. Air conditioning is old and could not maintain humidity. My room felt damp and smelled bad. Plumbing was noisy. The room felt like a 3-star motel. Until the property is renovated and upgraded, it  should not be a Four Seasons Property ",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Needs immediate renovation,
What makes Four Seasons stand out among other luxury hotels is definitely the staff service. Extremely personalised and likeable staff. Almost like they know every residents by name.  Location is also great - close enough to the city but hidden away from the hustle bustle and auro of exclusivity. ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Superb host,
The Management Staff at the Singapore Four Seasons is the best in the business.  From ensuring I have all I need for a great stay top packaging items for my travel.

They are simply the BEST!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best there is in hotel management,
Fantastic service and excellent concierge team.   Great gym and spa.

"I had some doubts before going  there,, all because the famous swimming pool in the roof of another hotel!!! When arriving there, I knew I had madethe right choice: quiet, elegant, personal attention. Comfortable rooms with all the necessary amenities. Very good recommendations from the concierges! Defintely the right choice, unless you prefer to saty in a thematic park",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best choice,
"The welcome at arrival at the hotel sold me. After a 13 hour flight and in the early hours of the morning, the very efficient check-in followed by an offer of a cup of tea/coffee and pastries was heart-warming. Also the chance to freshen up in the gym even though we did not take it. The concierge was extremely helpful at all times. We were surprised that staff who did not know which room we were in also knew our names. The restaurant was obliging enough to cook my husband noodles the way he wanted them. And room service was also very good. All the staff were friendly and ready with a smile.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pampered,

"Large and clean room with 2 lavatory bowls. A comfortable bath tab and a good functioning shawer. A delicate attention for changing used towels and cups. And a super comfortable bed! A fatigue by airplane must disappear by 1 night sleep. Someone thinks the location of this hotel is not good, but you can go through the next hotel Hilton (yes, you can), Orchard station is not far. There are 7/11, restaurants, shops and massages around the hotel. It is a quite good location.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best house keeping and the bed!,
"We had an amazing stay and will certainly return. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome. Our rooms were lovely, with stunning views across the city. The service really was great and the staff could not have been more helpful with advice and making arrangements for activities. Food wise I would definitely recommend the breakfasts and the Peking Duck.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful hotel with excellent service,
"We had a very pleasant stay here. I do not recommend trying to arrive via public transportation. It's just not very convenient. My only complaint was the bar service which featured extremely small wine pours combined with extremely high prices. Overall though, we were happy with our decision to stay here and will hopefully return someday! ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Quiet and Professional,
"Stayed here for three nights. Very convenient location, nice and clean rooms and last but not least exceptional four seasons service... would definitely recommend it if you're heading to Singapore....",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top notch service,
"Except for the fact that the decor was a little outdated,I would have given 5 stars. They are under renovation and took great care to ensure that we were not inconvenienced in any way. We got a large, luxurious corner room on the 11th floor and an extra bed for our son. The breakfast was exceptional and highly recommended. Most importantly what sets it apart is the service, but I guess that's what we pay for. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent.,
"Nicely located in a central but relatively quiet neighbourhood. Nice Pool, good restaurant. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere as the hotel is not too big and gives a private feeling.

"This beautiful hotel exceeded all our expectations, the location is perfect- few mins walk to the malls and Orchard Road, the rooms were very spacious, classy and comfy. The beds and pillows were amazingly comfortable, breakfast buffet had a wide selection of different food, room service was very good too. Excellent food and service in the bar, especially the afternoon tea which is unfortunately served only on weekends. Staff are very helpful, polite and  they took care of providing us with taxis whenever we needed them as well as helpful advice on any queries we had . Check in and out was rapid and efficient. Overall our stay was fabulous. We will definetly be staying at this hotel again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Highly recommend this excellent hotel,
"My family and I almost always stay at the Four Seasons when visiting Singapore. Its location on Orchard Boulevard is ideal, both for business or for leisure and shopping. The hotel is a little dated but what we enjoy most about this is the welcome we get each time we arrive here. The wonderful thing about FS Singapore is that staff turnover is very low and you see familiar faces, from the doorman, the receptionists, the waiters in the lounge and restaurant, and they have an amazing knack of remembering names and faces. Its like going home and though there may be some minor shortcomings, they always go out of their way to help.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Its like going home,

"Great hotel; Great location; Great staff and services. My son and I loved the 20th floor pool.   Went twice in July and the staff remember my son's name. He even lost his phone but the staff found it and kept it for him.  There's upper floor construction but you'll only notice it because they mention it. Nothing really bad to say about it.

A lovely hotel in the classic design located within walking distance of the shopping district on Orchard Road. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations but we were not disturbed by it. The staff are welcoming and helpful. We were a little disappointed with the breakfast choices and had expected freshly-squeezed juices and a better selection of hot items. The gym was well equipped and the pool was a good size. ,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great Stay, Centrally-Located",
I stayed at Four Seasons with my two teenage-children and we enjoyed the five star hotel very much. Hotel decoration inside and outside is lovely. Spacious room. We were well-satisfied with all room facilities. Best location. Away from traffic noise. Only 2 minutes walk to Orchard shopping street. Check-in check-out is fast and easy. Breakfast is excellent. Two nice pools. We preferred the pool for adults because the other pool had noisy children. Overall very high service. We would like to come back.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Lovely five star with easy access to Orchard shopping street,
"We experienced another great stay  at Four Seasons Singapore on way home from Israel . The service from all the staff is consistent ,  great food excellent massage / Spa how many hotels have indoor air conditioned tennis courts .

The hotel was under construction and my room was noisy. I talked to the front desk and they arranged a complimentary spa treatment for me which was very generous of them. I was not happy at the beginning, but they really did three best to make my stay pleasant. I also appreciated that I was able to relax at the lounge until my late night departure after check-out.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great location and wonderful hospitality,

"The hotel is located in an IDEAL spot in Singapore, being just a 1' walk away from bustling Orchard Road, yet not ON the main road.  Therefore, it combines the proximity to Orchard, with the peace and quiet of not being directly on it.  The interior is excellent, since it is not the chaotic big hotel that is impersonal, and it has the luxury that is becoming of the Four Seasons brand.  But the best feature of this hotel is the people: I stayed there just four nights and the staff made me feel right at home!  I have stayed in many 5* properties around the world.  The Four Seasons in Singapore is at the top of my list.  10/10 -will stay there again!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best hotel in Singapore,
"The staff are delightful in every aspect. My family and I were recognised by the majority of the staff, from the manager to the staff at the front door. My experience was to the utmost of satisfaction with credit to 2 delightful characters - Yoga (restaurant) and Nesh (concierge). These 2 are a credit to your establishment and should be rewarded with your inhouse staff applaud and recognition programs. The team outside the doors managing taxis and arrivals/departures is outstanding. The service is a reflection of your staff engagement and satisfaction. You have won me over and I will be a promoter for your brand. Thank you and looking forward to another Four Seasons experience.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,An Excellent Experience,
"Stayed here on a family trip to Singapore.  We have tried many hotels in Singapore, and this one felt most personalized.     Check in was nice and relaxing.  The front office person who checked us in let us sit and relax white my kids are running around.  She followed up on a request via a note to the room with good news.  Housekeeping updated the room while we were out, adding amenities for my 3 kids.  They also left a note when they had noticed something and did something they hoped would help.  Impressive.  Really enjoyed our stay here thanks to its top notch service.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great service,

"A day before our reservation we had asked the hotel if early check-in was ok. They said it was ok. On reaching the hotel, it was NOT ok! Rather than giving us solutions, the reception lady named Kyle was very rude to my friend and rudely spoke to us as nothing could be done. We thought the reason for her behaviour might be because we were not from Western countries.  The room decor was great but overall the warmth and hospitality was missing. Not going there ever again.",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Rude and Not warm,

"The Four Seasons Singapore is located in a relatively convenient location just off of Orchard Road. However, the service that we received at check in was unacceptable - shortly before departing on our trip, we had confirmed a nonsmoking room and twin beds, only to find that these were no longer available when we arrived on schedule. They attempted to place us in a nonsmoking room on a smoking floor - but beware that these floors still have a noticeable smell.   Overall, the hotel is average, but certainly nothing extraordinary. Most importantly, the customer service and guest rooms fell below the Four Seasons standard.",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Decent Hotel - But Poor Service,
"The Four Seasons Singapore offers a great value for money. It has a great location, two nice pools (one is only for adults) and a very nice bar in the evening. The staff is extremly friendly and well informed: the concierge gave us excellent tips for our stay in Singapore, which made our stay with our 9 and a 13 year old boys much more valuable. Only Minus: the breakfast is offered in a room next to the Lobby with hardly any daylight. Both mornings we had to wait in line for about 10 minutes until they could offer us a table in a room which had a little bit the charme of a canteen. The atmosphere there was not nice at all, but the choice and quality of food was therefor very good. ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great value,

"I am usually a tough rater of hotels, I travel a lot and know what good service looks like. This place is impeccable. To the point that the hotel manager came up and greeted me by name at breakfast. It is not just the service but the comfort and quality of the food and finishings. They are going through renovations which they manage from 9 am to 6, so I was never bothered by the ""noise"". They have a beautiful spa, pool, steam room and sauna on the 3rd floor and another pool on the 20th floor for families.It is a quick walk to Orchard and shopping and not far to Botanical Gardens took me 15 mins to walk there.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,No detail too small,

The room we had was so big with a huge bathroom that I felt that I didn't want to leave. The breakfast was lovely and all the staff where attentive and chatty without being too much.

My stay reminds me what Four Seasons stands for.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Highly recommend,
"Few hotels understand the needs of the long distance traveler as well as The Four Seasons in Singapore. As a regular guest over many years it's time to acknowledge just how good The Four Seasons is. No matter how dusty and bedraggled I am when I arrive, I'll be ready for anything within the hour. Wherever you choose to eat the menus are excellent, the service impeccable. The beds and pillows are sublime. Concierge, housekeeping, room-service, front desk - all brilliant.  Its greatest asset is its staff who are unfailingly helpful, polite and efficient. But the thing that lifts The Four Seasons out of the Very Good into the realm of Great is its ability to be consistently excellent year after year. A truly great achievement.

What a pleasant stay! Only few mins walk to Icon and the orchid mrt station. Great location! The hotel is a bit dated but the fantastic services offered by the hotel staff (ESP the gentlemen at the front) made the stay very nice!   My advice is make sure you request non smoking room if you don't smoke as the smells are very strong!   Also a suggestion to the hotel if they can consider not to replace the tooth brush and paste daily. I put mine in the glass after first night stay and they were gone. It's very wasteful I think. It's okay if you would place new sets in the bathroom in case guests would like to use new ones daily. ,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great location and excellent service,
"This was a fleeting visit. I used to be a frequent guest of this hotel but have not stayed here for many years. What struck me from time of entry to time of departure was that very little has changed in terms of service, reception and the Premier Room which I occupied. Credit to owners and management for being able to maintain everything to a consistently high level.  The Premier Room is indeed extra spacious and my only regret was that my stay was too short to enjoy it.

"I love it when it's located in Orchard Road yet not crowded. The staff were friendly, I was greeting by name by the door man every time I enter or exit the hotel. The gym was fantastic, there was a bottle of water and a towel placed on every machine. Not forgetting the ice water infused with cucumber and orange brings a refreshing zest my workout. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. Would love to come back here again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent stay,
"The staff was very friendly and accommodative. The room was brilliant. The buffet breakfast spread was good. Everything was just Four Seasons' quality, as you would expect.  The location was great as well. Away from the bustling shopping belt, Orchard Road but near enough to walk there; 5 minutes.  The room was clean and you feel a certain sense of luxury as you enter the room. There is the clean and expensive feel when you enter certain hotel rooms but with Four Seasons, you feel luxurious (if that make sense). Lol. And I was there for only one night. Haha.

"Overall other than very helpful staff and clean linen nothing else set this hotel apart. Breakfast was nice, room however not as big as expected with limited view of city from 10th floor. Did not get a chance to use gym or pool in my two day stay there. 5-10 minute walk to the surrounding 3 malls but too expensive to actually buy anything there compared to US.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Aging facility, nicely maintained",

"Central location and walking distance to the malls/Orchard train station (about 5-10mins walk)! Everyone was really friendly and we were given a room with a very nice view and also a surprise Happy Birthday cake (how thoughtful!) I must say Allison was really really helpful too as always offered drinks, towels, lotion, fruit sticks, cookies etc and she also sent me a Happy Birthday drink in my room! Felt like a princess! Pool was lovely as it was clean and no blocked view so you get direct sun. They have a lap pool downstairs as well. Great wifi connection, clean room/bathroom and I must say the beds are super comfortable Would I come back? OF COURSE! Excellent service!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Lovely Birthday Staycation!,
My wife and I spent one night there for our ROM and food tasting. We booked a one bedroom suite. The staff were very pleasant. It felt like we were in our own home. I personally haven't seen a service this good in a long time. Not to mention the food that was incredible. Kudos the the staff at the Four Seasons. My new favourite hotel.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very friendly and professional,
"Booked 2 rooms and stayed for 2 nights, unfortunately the rooms were not on the same floor. But it didn't really matter because everything was quite nice. We got a deal on the rooms so it was worth the value. But this is a really nice hotel, in a good location. A walking distance to ION shopping center and MRT. The bus stops are also close by. The staff was welcoming. Breakfast was excellent. Overall experience was very good. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A good stay,

"We only stay at the Four Seasons when we visit Singapore. Aside from the great location and the fact that it's very quiet, it's the staff that makes it fantastic. This is by far the warmest and friendliest hotel. They strives to provide a personal touch - greeting you by name, thoughtful handwritten notes etc.  I recall on one of our first visits that we left an item behind in error and they kept it for us until we returned months later.  This time we were celebrating a birthday and were given a lovely cake and fruit. We also returned to find afternoon tea in the room with a note welcoming us back again.  We have stayed at a few Four Seasons or visit others to dine but this one is our favourite.  ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Amazing (as always),
Have been staying at Four seasons SGP for couple years. And always a pleasant stay.  Wish they had a point system.  I would have gathered a lot of points by now.  Great facilities and great location to nearby Orchard road.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Definitely One of Top 3 Hotels in Singapore,

"Nicole is excellent - i booked the city view room, but it was a bit disappointed. she is very supportive, and help me to move to a garden view room  I enjoy the stay there.

"This is an excellent hotel. It is much smaller than I might have expected, but has an intimate feel. Coupled with the closeness to Orchard, but in a quiet location, it is a real gem.

"Stay here a few times before and like many who are satisfied with hotels I do not get around to writing up a comment. But the four seasons were fantastic on this trip. Combination of business and then a few days of rest with my wife.

"I love staying at the Four Seasons anywhere, but the hotel in Singapore is definitely one of my favorite places to stay in when I am there. It's nearby to Orchard Road and although a little pricey I feel at home here. The rooms are spacious, clean, and beautiful and room service is impeccable - their pancakes are so good. I know I can come back home and have a good night's rest and relax after a whole day of outing. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,My favorite hotel,
"Stayed with wife in Singapore for four nights. Very centrally located and yet in a quieter street away from Orchard Road. Very pleasant and attentive staff and the rooms were spacious. The only jarring note was the air-conditioning either stopped cooling or was turned off around 3 to 4 AM every night. Consequently one felt warm and was woken up from sleep. Repeated attempts to re start or turn down the temperature didn't help. Also, a hotel like this needs to have docks installed for iPhone or iPads for music playback with a decent sound system and remove the antiquated DVD/CD players. Otherwise a great property and worth staying at.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice place to stay,
"It does not include breakfast, at least not in the rate I paid, for the price that I paid, Other hotels same quality and price includes this.

"Stayed for two nights during the Coldplay Singapore tour. Hotel is conveniently located at Orchard, surrounded by lush greens with walking distance to the main shopping street. We reached the hotel from Kuala Lumpur about one and half hour earlier and were immediately checked-in although it was not check-in time yet (no question asked). Friendly staff and very accommodative on numerous occassions. Hotel room was immaculately clean and tidy with twice a day turn-down service, comfortable bed and spacious bathroom with excellent amenities too. Excellent buffet spread during breakfast with coffee/tea served in flask/pot. Overall, a very pleasant stay, will definitely stay again and recommend to other travellers as well.

"Great service, attentive housekeeping staff, and plenty of connectivity for business.  I stayed a week for business--easy to get to subway and CDB and also very convenient for shopping (and USD exchange rate is good right now).  I'd stay here again in a flash unless I decided I wanted to spend more time in a different area of town.  But with great subway access at easy taxi/Grabtaxi access, you can get anywhere pretty quickly.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice Business Hotel,

This hotel is outstanding - the staff are second to none - they are superb and very professional - I think with doubt the best hotel in Singapore. I would not stay anywhere else.

The room attendants pays close attention to little details and the room is very clean. The bed and pillows are very comfortable.

This should not have happened with a five star hotel.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Singapore Stay,
"The service at Four Seasons is what really made this hotel stand out. The staff went above and beyond expectation from the start. Waitstaff greet you by name when you come to breakfast in the morning. I had not notified the hotel of my birthday (and was traveling solo) and there was a cake, flowers, and card in my room when I returned for the day. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with the softest sheets I've experienced. The bathroom was beautiful. I would stay here or at any other Four Seasons in a heartbeat.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,By far one of my best hotel experiences ever!,

Knowing that we were there for a special occasion, the Guest Experience dept of Four Seasons delighted us when we walked into our rooms.  There were balloons, cakes, chocolates, macaron and sandwiches and to top it off, there were framed pictures of ourselves on our holiday trips. That was special to all of us and we appreciated the warm and thoughtful gesture by Four Seasons.  Here's to more special moments at the Four Seasons Singapore.

Though the hotel is not one of the recent creations in Singapore - the location: perfect; rooms & cleanliness: perfect; staff: perfect; food: perfect; attitude and ambience: can't desire more!

"Stayed at Four Seasons Singapore with my wife and 4 yr old child and they have completely spoiled us (booked boulevard room). Customer service is paramount to them and we noticed small nitty-gritty things they were doing. I have stayed in so many hotels worldwide but this one was simply amazing. The location, staff, room, breakfast and other amenities were simply fab. Cant get over there plush rooms and celeb style bathrooms (massive). While checking out i whispered about a nice umbrella as it was raining and the guy at the reception even though he was on other call heard me and gave us a brand new umbrella to take along as a gesture. We couldn't imagine staying anywhere else other than Four Seasons.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,OMG.. amazing it was,
"The staff were very friendly and helpful in this upmarket hotel with big clean rooms and a comfortable bed. There is a very nice rooftop pool. But I was rather put off by being told, on arrival, that breakfast was S$54 so I avoided eating and drinking while I was there. Don't head out of the front if you want to go the restaurants/shops but wander through the passage (and a strangely deserted shopping parade) to the Hilton which opens up onto Orchard Road.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good service,
Very nice hotel with large rooms and excellent service. Very personal and helpful touch from all customer service staff...quite unique these days...  Location is a little challenging if you need to get to meetings. Though once you arrive at hotel is very charming. The one annoying part is that the hotel elevators are always slow and you will be waiting a long time each time.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice tranquil spot,
"Great location for those not wanting a nightclub atmosphere.  Bus stops right outside the hotel.  Free shuttles to local train stations, have to book.  Very nice outdoor bar with a pool table.  Inhouse food is expensive except when buying food in the bar area.  Great value for money!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Hotel,
"This hotel was lovely. The location was perfect, very central and close to all public transport. The staff were super friendly and helpful, and I cannot compliment them enough.  The rooftop pool area was really relaxing and quiet, and again here the staff were fantastic. The rooms were very well furnished and bed was extremely comfortable. The only slight negative was an evening meal, where the buffet starter was not quite to our taste.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,First visit to Singapore ,
As a seasoned international traveller I am another easily surprised but here I was.   Staff are magnificent and thoughtful.  Leaving a selection of books for me while unwell during my stay and confined to my room.   Room service was quick and food arrived freshly prepared and warm when required.     The Sunday lunch was really a treat with a large selection of seafood and wonderful fruits.  We noted a number of non guests enjoying the fare and they seemed not to be be first timers!    Housekeeping do a wonderful job and restrooms and bar areas are well maintained and serviced.   Look forward to getting back,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons Five stars!,

My family of 4 stayed in a superior room.  It was very spacious with a fantastic bathroom.

The staff was 100% dedicated to making sure we had an enjoyable visit in Singapore.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A Great Family Stay,
"Four seasons as always delivers the best with service and cleanses. Hotel is not old and so the decor is. Rooms are spacious. Service is great. Loved the breakfast which includes Chinese, Indian, western and Japanese choice.  They have a special gifts for kids which is really nice of the hotel staff. We have received a greeting card for our little one left in the rooms with cookies and gift. Really appreciate that. I will suggest that card and gift is good enough and parents don't want to feed anything sweet now a days to kids.   Great stay overall   ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great stay,
"The rooms are big, clean and it has a nice decoration. The view is not the strongest point of the hotel, but it is not bad. The restaurant is good and with a kind service.

"First of all, I was able to get a room for one night at $300. That's such a great price for a hotel in Orchard. Second of all, not only was the room spacious, but the bathrooms were beautiful and had a large bathtub. This king size bedroom was perfect.  Lastly, the staff were kind and assisted me to my room as I checked in. It was lovely. 10/10 for service.   The experience here overall is worth every penny.

We liked the chinese restaurant very much.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Did not like my rooms and the location,

I highly recommend it and would personally stay here again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Exceptional!,
"Great hotel, will be hard to add a lot of information considering all the other reviews so I added some photos from the room. Maybe one of the only disadvantages is that it is not walking distance to anything that interesting and you would need to take a car to get a bite a a hip restaurant in the city. Amenities are great with 2 pools, one adult-only and one for families on the rooftop",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons standards: great hotel excellent rooms,
Fore Seasons Singapoore is an old fashioned Style Hotel which I like. Service is very good. Once you are a regular guest the porter is welcoming you with your room key and you don't need to go to the reception desk. That's what I call service. The rooms are big and with usual comfort. Nice big pool on the 3rd floor. If you check in the bar try the Negroni. They do it very good. ,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,On of a regular trip to Singapore ,
"Everything is calm and luxurious. If I get a chance to stay, I will choose Four Seasons again. Almost of stay this hotel was Biz trip so I just need relax and sleep well.

There is nothing around hotel but Orchard Road is 10 minutes walk around.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best calm and luxurious hotel in Singapore,
"As a stopover recovery from two weeks of travel in Northern Laos and Cambodia, this was exactly the respite we needed.  Beautiful room, cross-city view, high-end amenities -- all exceeding expectations.  However, it was the extra energy and professional awareness of the staff at every turn that made this extraordinary.  In addition, dinner at the JIANG-NAN CHUN restaurant within the property was outstanding with service and food quality that matches the best in Paris or London.  Take some time to just look around and appreciate the design and commitment to excellence in the lobby, the rooftop pool, the antiques and art pieces everywhere.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Compassionate, empathetic, cheerful staff with the highest level of competence in a top notch property",

"the reason why I didnt give 5 star was because I was quite disappointed with the check in process. Not even a glass of water was given to us, not to mention juice, hot towel or anything else. This is unexpected from such a luxury hotel. I was staying at other luxury hotel around the area just 3 weeks before so I can't help myself compare them.  As for others, everything was great.

"This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of several attractions (such as Orchard street) and across the street from the stop of the hop on, hop off tour bus. The accommodations and service are what you should expect from a Four Seasons' hotel, so you should not be disappointed. Surprisingly the price per night was not that much different from other hotels, including the Orientals. The breakfast was very good, with multiple options for westerners and locals, as was the Chinese restaurant in the second floor, which was highly recommended and we enjoyed, and the bar in the first floor, which offered multiple unique cocktails as well as the usual ones. I would definitely recommend this hotel in Singapore.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great place to stay while on business in Singapore,

There are so many positives to the hotel:  1) Staff are generally very courteous and professional 2) The lobby is gorgeous and well maintained 3) Rooms are generously sized and well maintained (even if they are somewhat dated, this hardly shows).  4) Breakfast is divine. I'm obsessed with their rose-infused honey (a creation of Chef Yoshi, who unfortunately no longer works at the hotel). 5) The gym and spa are also very good. 6) Location is excellent.  Highly recommended - I look forward to my next stay.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic experience once again,

I can,t complement the Hotel staff and service enough the best service I have ever experienced. Food in restaurants and poolside excellent. Well done Four Seasons Singapore , we have been staying at the Shang for over 25 years whilst the Shangri-La hotel has a better outside swimming pool area it is a much busier hotel and not so personalised Special thanks to Hospitality Manager Amanda she went over and beyond her duty to  make our families feel special.  Michael Burd",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic stay at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,
The beauty of the Four Seasons is you don't have the mass crowd and yet you are just a short stroll away from Orchard Road. You can stroll out of the hotel towards Wheelock or walk thru the internal walkway to the Hilton Hotel and onto Orchard Road.  Staff service as usual was exceptional.  ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Quiet 6 Star Hotel Escape ,
"Hotel is a bit dated, but location is great.  We had a very large suite with an awkward layout.  The bathroom was in the entry foyer and you had to walk across the entry foyer to enter the bedroom.  Therefore, if you were getting showered and dressed, you could not have guests in the living area.  The housekeeping staff and room service was exquisite, but many of the other hotel staff had a bit of a sour attitude.  Also, there was no ""club level"" at this Four Seasons, which was a disappointment after staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Fantastic location, but hotel could use a make-over.",
"Very good concerige service that is very attentive to your needs. Howeve, I do not understand why in house guest have to buy a daily carpark coupon and its not complimentary. Would still strongly recommend",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,personalised stay,
"Nice location, very good Chinese restaurant, very nice Bar and very professional staff. For people enjoy shopping, the Orchard street is not fare, lot of Mall and present place. Many restaurant around, very easy for a nice lunch or diner.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Amazing Hotel,
I had a large premium room which seemed good value for money given its size and facilities. The hotel was very comfortable and the food very good. The chinese restauarant I particularly enjoyed. The staff could not have been more efficient or helpful and the atmosphere in the hotel generally was very good.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"High quality luxury hotel, excellent service",
"Stayed at this property with our 2 children (8 & 10 years) and had a wonderful experience.  What I love most about the Four Seasons is how they cater to families and children in general.  The small touches make our kids feel so special.  The usual amazing beds, robes, toiletries and comforts you'd expect in any Four Seasons property.  We had a mid-morning flight into Singapore so our room was not yet ready but the staff escorted us to the spa to use the facilities to freshen up and use the pool until the room was available.  The staff were all incredible, especially the exceptional service we received at the pool.  Beautiful hotel in a great location.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Exceptional...just what you'd expect,
"Great location in the hub of the shops - if that is what you require - walking distance.  The hotel staff were amazing going out of their way to assist us when we left our phone in a taxi :(   Within in 30 minutes it was returned to us amazing!  Nothing was too much trouble the staff were eager to arrange tours and give assistance with arrangements.  The room was spacious and well appointed.,",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Taste of Singapore,
"I recently visited the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, as a friend of mine will travel to SG, and he is looking for the hotel near the Orchard Road. Therefore, I visited 3 hotels on Orchard Road, FS, Hilton and Grand Hyatt. FS Front Office's staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about their products. Although the room is not so impressive, which I think they are also realized. However, their exceptional service makes difference. Finally, I recommended my friend to book at FS, and make a try.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Service from Front Office Staff,
I have stayed at many of the Four Season's properties. They never disappoint. As no surprise the Singapore property was fabulous. Great location and easy to move around the city from. The staff will go above and beyond to make your stay the best it can be. The service truly is second to none.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best of the Best,
"I went to attend a local conference and while the lobby and entrance to the conference hall are fairly spacious, the actual conference hall was a little disappointing given the low ceiling. Perhaps more at fault was the choice of venue by the organisers as the set up required a stage and big screen which was not perfectly visible from the back. Otherwise great venue, clean and good service! ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Conference Venue,
"Beautiful hotel. I stayed in a premier room and was amazed at the size of the room and the luxurious ensuite. Service was impeccable and the maids even left notes everyday for me and would tie up my phone cables etc. whilst the view is not the most amazing, it has a very central location. I would highly recommend it!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Awesome Stay ,
You can always count on Four Seasons to be among the very top hotels in every market in which they operate.  Singapore is certainly no exception.  I travel to Singapore frequently for work and often stay at the Four Seasons.  It's service is impeccable.  Rooms are so comfortable.  Food is delicious.  Location is very convenient.  Thank you for always taking such great care of me!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel in the heart of Singapore's Orchard Road District,

"I enjoyed the hotel's atmosphere and decoration in the lobby. Service was impeccable from start to finish. Buttler, room service and housekeeping staff were highly trained and very friendly, helping to ensure that one feels at home during the stay. Concierge was very helpful with recommendations and bookings. If anything, the rooftop pool is on the smallish side...",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very pleasant stay,
"Since the minute you get to Singapore's airport you get the idea of the impecable city you're getting to. Everything in the city is incredibly clean, modern, luxury and kind people.  The Four Seasons couldn't be the exception. Incredible service from the second you arrive, as expected. Luxury, orchids everywhere, beautiful lobby. But, the rooms, the common areas such as the pool are outdated. They were clean, a good size, but definitely could have a remodelation. They're The Four Seasons after all, that's what you expect, Excellence.  Foos and the bar were really nice, breakfast buffet on the other hand, was average, expected a bit more. A good experience, nice location, but next time I would rather stay at another hotel for that amount of money.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Nice hotel, a bit outdated.",
"Once again we were not let down the Four Seasons brand coupled with Singaporean Hospitality is hard to beat. The hotel has a great location one block from Orchard Road the Singapore shopping Mecca. It is convenient to all downtown significant locations to visit and the suites are wonderfully appointed. We were only here two nights, as we were passing thru but don't miss a wonderful hotel to stay at.  ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This was our 37th Four Seasons Hotel ,
"I stayed in this hotel for a night staycation with my cousin. We were both so disappointed. Four seasons hotel so old and low maintenance. During our stay our room number 1312 we were not able to sleep so well because we felt so itchy. Like some small ants or whatever biting us. It kept me awake until 4am. Even if you just stand inside the room or sit in their chair you will feel something biting you and so itchy. Aircon is not cold and i could smell dusty carpet. Pillows are so old and my neck hurts. I hope they focus more on the maintenance. This is four seasons hotel,yet we were disappointed.",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very Disappointed,
I always choose this hotel for my business trip to Singapore.  Convenient access to orchard road yet quiet and away from the buzz.  Not all guests may be aware but there is connecting access through the mall to Orchard.  Staff are almost warm and you can feel the welcoming hospitality the moment you get off the cab.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"One of the best hotel in Singapore, top class, warm service that is always efficient and attentive.",
"We have stayed in this luxury hotel for two nights, it deserve 6 stars, everything in this place is perfect, from the time you check in to the time you leave, food there is just unbelievable , North Atlantic Lobster, Alaska King Crab, well is not cheap ,but  first class and we sure had a great time.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great hotel,
"Stayed at Four Seasons and enjoyed excellent and dedicated service. The hotel is very clean, the bed and the pillow are super comfortable, bathroom large and well appointed. I could not really complain about anything. You can't go wrong at Four Seasons.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Service was typical outstanding,
"The good: excellent staff (universally friendly and eager to help). Decent bathroom. Truly seamless, working, non-fiddly, reliable wifi literally everywhere in the hotel. Huge desk in room for working (exec suite).  Good quality room service. 20m pool, so you can do lengths, and good gym.   The bad: room a little tired - this is not a new hotel - and not very light. There are a lot of hotels out there with floor to ceiling windows and this is not one of them. Location is so-so (if you know London, it is just off the Singapore equivalent of Oxford Street. Not everyone would think that's a classy locale).  Friendly but slightly tired spa - again, feels as if it is waiting for a facelift. ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good and bad,
"Our family (2 adults and 2 children) was there at the beginning of August.  Great welcome, very prompt and supportive concierge during our stay - our son did not feel well and had to replan our trip, which with their help was easy.  Lovely restaurant where we had Sunday brunch and great bar just a few minutes walking from Orchard Road and the Botanic Garden.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Cosy and professional,

This hotel has also gorgeous and thick atmosphere and the staffs are friendly, kindly and smart.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best hotel in Singapore,
"We went to Singapore to take our daughter to her IASIS swim meet at SAS.  I went there for a few days of work.   The Four Seasons is a wonderful hotel which is close to a few shopping centers and places to eat.  We stayed there for about 5 days.    Like all Four Seasons hotels, it is clean and the service is very good.  If you are going there, get the room above the tennis courts.  Your room will be fairly quiet and you have a view of the forest (not the city streets)",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Went to IASIS but stayed at the Four Seasons,
"The staying in the hotel was very pleasant, high standard and enjoyable. i liked the location very much very convenient to the shopping district and not far to MBC.

The breakfast was good.The rooms very tidy and clean, I was so impress with housekeeper how the rooms keep tidy and clean as well organised.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The hotel condition and service absolute excellent,
"Superbly run hotel conveniently located near robust shopping arcades. Taxi and Uber rides, to almost everywhere, are incredible easy and, compared to the US, very inexpensive. Breakfast service is wonderful. Top floor pool is very nice. Wouldn't hesitate to book my next Singapore stay here. Only complaint - it's 2016 - why isn't there HD TV?",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent ,
"My partner and i spent four days in Singapore and loved the Four Seasons. The rooms were so comfortable, quiet, and the house keeping was outstanding. The pools were well maintained and not too busy which was nice. We had a nice  buffet meal in the restaurant thought the dessert selection was disappointing. This did not detract from the attentive and friendly staff. Close to Orchard road  and train station. Will stay again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A lovely hotel,
"Had two interconnecting rooms on the 9 th floor Facing treetops.  Be warned there is currently construction on the other side of the building so we were unable to get an upgrade as included in our booking. No compensation was offered instead  Rooms were nice bathrooms big. Mine had a leaking bidet and a slight musty smell. One night some noise woke us all in the hallway Breakfast good, loved the fresh coconuts  Pool areas there are two  Go to the 3 rd level if you don't want to get sunburned as its always in the shade Rooftop pool attendant was fabulous. Treated us like royalty  Great area soft loungers and free sunscreen lots of umbrellas  Loved to location. Luxe & great concierge service that helped with our flights and meal bookings no hesitation  ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, good standard ",
"Stayed for a few nights (very good sized connecting rooms) you need to do a rat run (easy) through the shopping centre and Hilton to get onto Orchard Road.  Really only used hotel as a base and if the Hilton next door was same price you should stay there for location.  Staff etc, very simile but did not do a great deal for us.  Will probably never be back as just ok, not brilliant.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Not bad at all, so long as good value.",
Love this place best location in town near by everything great decor super nice and professional staff we check in stood 8:30 pm took us straight to our room no time wasted to our surprise they upgrade our room to a suite without me asking cause I had my 10 year old girl with us thanks to Alicia from guest relations Room are spacious clean the breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was super good different variety of foods from different continents  Overall I am not surprised when it comes to the four seasons chain they are good at what they do ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great location ,
"Not cheap, but worth it. Front desk service impeccable! Rooms are nice and large. The lounge at the gym and pool level offers fruits, coffee and tea on a free flow basis for guests. Lost my access card and it was replaced within a minute without questions asked. Fab static service upon checkin and I was escorted to my room with a smile. Got a buy 2 nights get 3 deal. Without breakfast, sg$1,200.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Not cheap, but worth it. Front desk service impeccable!",
"Our second stay at the Four Seasons in the last two years and again a fantastic stay. Great room, amazing service, good food. It is expensive - particularly breakfast - but felt like we got value for money.  We stayed in an executive suite with two extra beds for our 9 and 6 year old kids. It was a really good setup for us.  Breakfast was amazing (but as per above be aware it's pricey). Service was excellent.  We really like the location - easy walk or taxi to where we wanted to go. Even tried the MRT this time - pretty easy from the stop in the ION Orchard.  Finally, a big thanks to the pool attendant up on level 20 - best service hands down (sorry don't remember your name). ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic experience again,
"Stayed for 6 nights during a business visit, with my wife and child. We stayed at the executive suite. All staffs were extremely nice and gentle.  20F pool for children was quiet, clean, so nice for little ones, full of toys. My most strongly recommendable pool for children. One bad point was that the elevator was too slow.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Traditional and still gorgeous! Strongly recommend,
Very centralized and close to Orchard Rd but minus the heavy foot traffic.  Rooms are in good condition considering they've been there for a quite a few years without a major noticeable decor overhaul.  They did have a cleaning/oversight glitch in the shower when we arrived but they tended to it the next day and were full attentive and apologetic.  Had a very good meal at their Chinese restaurant the night we left and certainly would go back.  Nothing bad on a short stay beyond the housekeeping issue.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Location!,
I recently stayed at the Four Seasons for 6 night.  Fantastic spacious rooms with a beautiful view and the most comfortable beds and massive bathroom.  The two pool areas are fabulous. The service impeccable.. Amazing concierges and our driver Shawn was the best tour guide.  A must see is the light show at Gardens by the Bay and a walk in the botanical gardens is magical.  Overall this hotel and Singapore did not disappoint.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Position Great Hotel,
"What can I say, it's a Four Seasons!  Everyone welcomes you by name from the doormen to the concierge to the dining staff.  There are always nice little touches like fresh fruit or chocolates in the room.  The cleaning staff noticed I was using a plane ticket as my bookmark so they replaced it with a nice bookmark and a very pleasant note.  Again attention to detail.  It is conveniently located a short walk to the metro station and is right next to great shopping.  You can't go wrong.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Unsurpassed quality and attention to detail,
There is something very friendly about this hotel that I haven't seen elsewhere. Booked for 6 days with a combination of work and holiday. I ordered a birthday cake for my grandson and when we were picked up at the airport the hostess and the driver both wished him a happy birthday.  This was really nice for kids and of course was repeated on arriving at the hotel. After day one being out and about we were welcomed back using our family name - it's just that much more personal. Another grandson has an egg allergy and even when I order room service they are aware of it. Great hotel in all respects.  ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Business and family holiday,
"The Four Seasons hotel is second to none in the South east Asian island nation. The warm staff greeted us at the front gate and quickly checked us into our 1 bedroom suite. The beautifully decorated suite with high ceilings was a lovely place to spend the days. The two full bathrooms were more than comfortable for the three of us. On most every interaction, the staff was beyond kind and was able to fulfill any request, from late checkout to dinner reservations. In addition, the concierge was very good about helping us coordinate sight seeing tours for Singapore and other destinations that we were to visit. The restaurants at this hotel were beyond impeccable and there was a wide array of local and international food types. In all, this is an absolutely lovely hotel.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Super classy hotel,

Stayed here for 4 nights as part of our RTW trip. Massive room where everything worked. Very helpful and informative staff. Very convenient for both the metro and the big shopping centre just down the road.

The first thing I would comment on was the staff, they could not do enough and it was clear that exceptional customer service was a top priority for everyone.

It was in a great location close to all the good shops and an easy cab ride to every attraction in the City.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, super friendly staff",
I stayed here for business and we had a training session at the hotel. The rooms are lovely with huge bathrooms. The breakfasts are incredibly delicious with a mix of great international fare.

The room here was very nice with a comfortable bed and nice mini bar. We did not visit the pool as it was raining but it looked fine. What is amazing here is the bar and bar service. We ate at the bar and a bartender offered to go to a Hawker stand and get me an oyster omelet (learn about it on youtube). His manager told him he could not however so the kitchen made us another local staple for free just to give us a nice authentic taste of Singapore. The service was incredible and that bartender is awesome.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Above expectations,
"Just a few steps to Ion Orchard where you can also take the mrt and then there is the shortcut to Orchard road via the Hilton Hotel. We stayed for 3 nights.  The staff are very helpful, provided maps and tips when asked how to go around the city by public transportation.  They also arranged our private transportation to Legoland.  It was a bit pricey but very convenient.  The hotel itself was very clean, the room is quiet and beds are very comfortable.  They don't have a big lobby where you can hang around a bit but I guess most guests are in a hurry anyway so there's really not much need for it.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, feel the difference",
"We have stayed at this Four Seasons a couple of times and the hotel, it's staff and location (just off Orchard Road), never disappoints. The rooms are large, the service is incredible and the prices are not bad at all (there are always good deals to be had). If staying awhile in Singapore or just as a stopping off point, it's our 'go to' place. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A gem of a hotel in Singapore,

Will definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Amazing Stay with exceptional service +++,
"Visited Singapore for a 5 days visit and chooses this hotel for its location (not in a crowded spot in town but still easy access). Greeted nicely during check in and escorted to our 2 connecting rooms. Clean and spacious rooms with a good view of the city. The kids received some goodies and that really made their day :). Breakfast were great with many selections of food to choose. From the hotel, we could stroll down easily to MRT and accessed orchard road at ease.  I think this is a good choice of stay when we visit Singapore. Would definitely be back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL,
"I was expecting more from four seasons Singapore , this hotel if compared with any other four season around the world will be at the end of the list.

"The staff at the Four Seasons Singapore are on a higher level than most high quality hotels, they simply care more about their guests, they are polite, professional and make us feel at home the minute we walk in.  I simply cannot rate my recent stay with them highly enough.  We were looked after particularly well in reservations and check in, they made our stay beyond perfect, the rest of the staff simply carried on at that high level.  We were travelling with a sick 9 yr old and my wife was still recovering from pneumonia.  We could not have asked for better service, this alone made our trip back to London much easier.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Simply perfect service,
"Prime location linked to a shopping mall (Hilton Shopping mall), from there, you can walk to Orchard Rd. Chinese restaurant Jiang Nan Chun is good and Cafe is decent. Not a lot of choice in dining but once you walk to Orchard Road, plenty of choices there. Room is Four Season standard, staffs friendly and efficient.

I had four nights here between business in Sydney and Hong Kong. The service was exceptional as one might expect from a Four Seasons. But the staff impressed with special touches. The lap pool is a great feature and is on a different floor from another pool open to children. Their new Chinese restaurant is amazing.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,An Oasis in busy Singapore,
"Lovely gracious hotel with very good service the moment I stepped out of the taxi. Rooms are well appointed, especially appreciated the bathroom mirrors that allow a good view of how I look fr the back! My room attendant was very efficient and sweet; day 1 he left a note saying he'd tidied all my charger wires; day 2 he left me a spectacle cleaning cloth as he noticed my case didn't have 1. Very nice personal touch.  Would stay here again but not for big meetings.  3* rating because Ballroom chandelier was clinking constantly due to the air conditioner blowing the crystals against each other. AV had awful feedback despite manny corrective events.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Would have been 5* except for poor meeting facilites,
"Food, amenities, staff was overall good. Only problem was when I had a problem with my room, the situation was not handled with customer satisfaction in mind. I need to change room because I was placed in a smoking floor, and I ended up in a handicapped room in a non smoking floor. I requested for some sort of compensation for the hassle I need to go thru, but none was given, not even a small token of appreciation (for eg: a fruit basket, etc).",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Overall good,
"The warm welcome I received over the length of my stay was second to none. The room embodied comfort and peace and in all I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my time there. The moment I entered the premises the wonderful aromatic touch infused at the lobby accentuated the finer details of the interior coupled with minimal lighting which put me at a center of a golden experience. Despite the briefness of my stay, it was worth the experience and it left me a lasting impression and that desire embedded in me to instigate a return.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Warm reception defines some of the qualities of the hotel,
We arrived in Singapore at 1:00 a.m. - meet by very friendly and helpful driver who filled us in on the scoops.  We used the Four Seasons app to check in while we in the airport in Narita.  The night manager meet us upon arrival - let us know what we should upgrade to a larger suite - better package deal than what we had booked.  The stay kept getting better and better.  The suite had a spectacular view.  The breakfast buffet was incredible.  Wonderful indoor and outdoor bar - great drinks and light bites.  The concierge service provided us with great recommendations for dining off campus.  I highly recommend the Four Seasons.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Another Great Four Seasons Property,

The gym was great - really good sauna in the men's change rooms. Pool was excellent. Didn't have room service so cannot comment, but the wedding was held at the hotel and the food and service were fantastic. Hotel is a short walk to Wisma at the top end of Orchard Rd - really handy to the MRT. All round loved the place. Will stay here next time I am in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel,
"This was a pleasant surprise, when we checked in i asked if i could get a late checkout, as my flight was not leaving till 22.00 & surprisingly the answer was no problem you can stay at no extra charge, the staff made it a point to remember you by name which makes you feel very special even though this was the first time we stayed there, i would highly recommend the hotel to any traveler staying in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent service,

We have been at many Four Season hotels to use their restaurant and Spa and have always experience outstanding quality of service.  This weekend was no exception which we enjoyed.

Staff throughout the hotel were delightful and service from all departments excellent.  The hotel is well located at the Tanglin end of Orchard and our room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped.

We will be booking again shortly for our next stopover in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,best beds Ever,

The staff at every level were wonderful and welcoming with nice personal touches including noticing my birthday was during our stay so I was serenaded and presented with balloons and birthday cake to celebrate.

My husband and I stayed for 3 nights on our way to Australia in January and this is the best hotel we have stayed in. Very friendly staff and attention to detail was second to none. We were given an upgrade( without even asking) as our flight had been delayed to a larger room. Needless to say the hotel was spotless and the breakfasts fantastic with everything you could possibly want.Good location for the shopping malls and Botanic Gardens-further away from Raffles and Marina Bay but very easy to use the air conditioned underground to get about-and cheap.Hotel has a lovely rooftop pool. Would definitely stay here again.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fabulous!,
"I really can't say enough good things about the Four Seasons in Singapore. Their service was flawless, friendly and helpful. The room was super comfortable, roomy, clean and comfortable. During my stay there, my wife was trying to get over a cold and she slept a lot while I sat in a super comfortable chair, read, and looked out over the city from the room. We of course did a lot in the city during our time there after she felt better, but I also had to do some work there and this hotel was perfect for our every need.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Hotel,

"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Four Seasons.The outside of the hotel & lobby are unassuming but the room was so impressive. Especially the large bathroom with the speakers that mean you can hear the TV even while showering. The pools were excellent and never crowded. Special mention to Alison at the Rooftop Pool. She was just so lovely bringing us glasses of iced water & guava juice. She also made sure we were wearing sunscreen and insisted we use Aloe Vera before leaving the pool. Really made us feel like we were special and cared for.   The only down side was our room was always serviced very late. Between 4.30 - 5.30pm which impacted our use of the room. But despite this small annoyance, we would definitely stay here again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Service Stars,
"Excellent service as I would expect from a Four Seasons. Really, it's a cosy small hotel, close to the hustle and bustle of Orchard but still away from it to be quiet.

"My first stay at the Singapore Four Seasons and I'm sure it won't be my last!  While this property is not right on Orchard Road, it's still close enough to walk over for shopping and dining.  Attaching a few photos of the lovely suite I was treated to.  I'm not sure what the room level was considered, but the room was huge with an AMAZING view of the Marina area from the bedroom and the bathroom!  All the amenities as others have pointed out including your own Nespresso machine, and every day, the hotel left an evening treat of fruit, some amazing cookie dish that was amazing, various chocolates, etc.  All delicious!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A Suite Stay!,

"Not as elegant and prestigious as Four Seasons in Florence or Istanbul but a fine hotel that further reinforces the brand.  We stayed in a deluxe room on the 19th floor - pretty standard city hotel layout but a little larger than most.  Really nice marble bathroom with separate walk in shower, enclosed WC and twin basins.  Possibly the most comfortable king bed ever - wonderful bed linen.  Good breakfasts, nice bar, more than adequate dinner in informal restaurant.  Excellent concierge service.  Located away from main tourist areas but 10 minutes in cab (very cheap).  Nice roof pool.  Last point - better Singapore Slings than you know where!  Oh what a surprise!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,You get what it says on the can.....,

First let me say the staff of the four seasons Singapore are fantastic. Exceptionally obliging and very friendly. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the old and outdated hotel. Our executive suite was rather unimpressive with a small bath and poor natural lighting. It may have once been a top hotel however it's now showing it's age and can't compete with the likes of the Marina Bay Sands.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Old and dated, though exceptional staff.",
"Nice big room, great location but very tired. We were in a suite and for 2 of our 3 nights had a crying baby next door which didn't help but this hotel needs an overhaul.

"The service, amenities and the room was fantastic. We stayed in the suite which turned out to be the best choice ever! Staff was mostly polite and helpful!

Definitely will return for another stay in future!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,It was a great experience!,

"We used to live in Singapore, frequenting this hotel for occasional Saturday lunches, ""special occasions"" meals and yes, some weekend stays. It had been some years since we stayed, and so chose to make stay over Christmas Eve & day/night. There were no disappointments -- including the perfect Christmas Day buffet (no dinner needed that night!). Cafe 190 is a joy, but the room was stunning as well (and we hadn't opted for anything more than the usual ""deluxe"" room). The Four Seasons might best be known for its service, however -- we think it's unbeatable.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"After all, it's a Four Seasons...",
I had a function recently at the hotel and what most pleased me was the Banquet staff are not only service excellent but are also very attentive and detail in their work.

Good Job guys,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Service,

Yet not too intrusive to a point that you get annoyed. The four seasons property is well maintained and meets expectations. I get that nice colonial feel the minute i walk into the lobby / room - for me, that's a real plus point.

"From the moment we arrived at the airport to see the four season's driver waiting for us to the arrival at the hotel where everyone seemed to know our name and throughout our entire stay of 5 days we had a marvelous stay at the Four Seasons.  The staff service was excellent, the room was very modern and clean, the hotel was classic Four Seasons quality, the restaurants were quite good and the location was ideal to enjoy Orchard Blvd.  When we checked in, I was not feeling real well after a long flight.

Expected a lot more from a Four Seasons Hotel. Front desk was not very pro-active in providing solution for our needs. Our room and bed were small. Our stay was not all that comfortable.  Housekeeping was inconsistent. First day was thorough and complete but the succeeding days were not.  We could hear noise from construction outside and some noise from floor above.  Breakfast food spread is very good though.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Expected a lot more from a Four Seasons,

The staff provided excellent service from check in to check out. The room is good sized with all in room amenities. The bathroom comes with shower and a long bath. The bed is very comfortable.

Perfect in every way.  2AM arrival picked up at airport and almost directly delivered to lovely high floor huge quiet room on corner.  Amazing view.  Super quiet every night - no traffic or noise from other rooms.  Super comfortable - great nights sleep even with jet lag.  Room service was prompt and perfect for someone planning on working.  Room set up well for working/TV/sleeping/enjoying the view.  Good air conditioning.  And one of the few hotels with a pool big enough for lap swimming and a great uncrowded workout space.  Walking distance to shopping makes for an interesting distraction.  Liked the peacefulness of the public areas as well and being able to come and go without crowds of people around.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great home away from home,
"A classic Four Seasons hotel, with a convenient location and very nice plantings around the place.  Inviting entrance and service desk.  Excellent restaurant just off the lobby with an unusually good buffet at lunch time, which (the buffet) changes a bit every day.  They offer a nifty non-alcoholic mint and lemon summer drink that will put the spring back in your step after you've spent a few hours outside in the heat.  Rooms well appointed and very clean.  A tough driveway to get into because cars have to make a 180 degree turn from the main road,but taxis and locals seem to have mastered it.  Highly attentive staff.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Pleasant place, excellent service",
I enjoyed the calm of the hotel. It is not huge and you have the impression it is only you and few other people. Large room and nice view. At 1 minute walk from ION shopping mall and Orchard road.

"The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to shopping centres and tourist attractions. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed - everything works as you would expect. The room service menu is good, albeit quite expensive, as is the breakfast, which is not included in the room rate. However in my experience the memory I take away is the highly competent, helpful and friendly staff. This will now be the yardstick against which I measure standards of service in similar hotels. The gym is good, as are both swimming pools. The hotel is family and child friendly.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Comfortable with friendly and professional service,
"Attended a luncheon.  First time to the hotel. Very plush.  Rich and pleasant interiors and nicely quaint.   However luncheon I attended had a set 3 course menu with wines. Was dissapointed at the quality of the food and the service.  The main course was very ordinary. And the staff were rather young, not attentive and the flow of food not timely  (some arriving and other not making everyone wait ), drinks order not taken, wine served incorrectly and to a point where one of the guests had a drink spilled on them. This side can be improved.   Am sure the rooms and the restaurants must be well rated.  ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Meeting facilities Meals,

The reception service was excellent. For the next five days, the room supplies were promptly replenished. The rooms are not that big. The location is good, near the Orchard Road and shopping centers. The taxi fare to Gardens by the Bay is around 11 sgd during non-peak hours and around 15 sgd during peak hours. The hotel is a bit old but continued to be renovated.

Food was excellent (except maybe the pool bar food which could do with a more modern heathy upgrade), service was excellent (especially at the pool bar where the two ladies even booked a baby sitter and then reconfirmed in our room two hours later), the rooms were 'four season' and very good.

"The well decorated lobby and the comfortable bed do meet the expectation of a Four Seasons Hotel. The staff are all very well trained and helpful, and always with a warm smile to offer help and advice which is not something usually offered in Dingapore hotel. The hotel is at the quite alley up on a slope above busy Orchard Road and you need to take a10-15minutes walk across the open carpark to the shopping area which will be inconvenient for serious shoppers with many bags on hands. The Chinese restaurant is also a surprise for Singapore standard. The food is as good as most of the Cantonese restaurants in Hong Kong although the price is a bit high. Early booking is recommended as the restaurant will get busy with outside guests during lunch time.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good Services at a quiet corner of the busiest street in Singapore,
I was back in this hotel for the 1st time since 1998. I found the hotel very comfortable and not tired as I was expecting. The check in and check out experience was wonderful with the reception attendant granting a slightly later checkout time due to my conference ending a little later. The room was very largest and tastefully furnished. The only downside in the room was that the lighting was a little dim and I would have preferred to have the lights adjustable for romantic dimmer lighting and brighter lighting for working in the room. The location of this hotel is very good being only 3-4 mins walk the shopping Mecca of Orchard Road. The nearest MRT station is at ION Orchard shopping mall and is only a 5 min walk away.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,1st Return visit since 1998,
"Overall is good but pricey. The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly. The bed and the pillow are super comfortable.

They have 2 swimming pools but no chance to use it due to tie schedule. The location is near to Orchard Road, just a short walk down to the street.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good!,
"Unlike another really bad hotel in Singapore, we love Four Seasons.  The main problem with all hotels in Singapore are the beds are too hard. But Four Seasons is a world class hotel.

"When arranging a very last minute room for two nights from the runway en route to Singapore from KL, only one destination came to mind. With a wife, a five and one year old, I needed a reliable base.  Despite us pushing over our normal budget, the investment was returned in bucketloads. Personal service, never too much asked, the wonderful rooms and childrens robes and toiletries in the rooms - the amazing breakfast!  If you're considering it, do it. You'll never find a relaxed, professional and discrete establishment as the FS Singapore. My wife was absolutely overjoyed with the hotel.  Oh and the bed, toiletries and bathroom were all fantastic.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A safe bet that delivers more than the room fee,
"I've stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore a couple times for business.  While many (most?) hotels in the Orchard areas are nice, I prefer both the service and location of the Four Seasons.  The location is perfect ... it was easy to hail a taxi in the AM  (the hotel is just slightly outside the ERP zone), and it's a short walk to the ION mall with great shopping and food.  The staff at the Four Seasons are incredibly nice and welcoming.  Rooms are spacious, modern, and quiet.    I don't dine at the hotel often given the proximity to many great, local restaurants (and the hotel restaurants seem much more expensive than the convenience offered).  The gym is nice ... plenty of equipment available at the times I went.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice location on Orchard with great staff,
"Stay for 2 nights for holiday  Four Seasons Singapore has excellent location, just short walk from ION and Orchard MTR. Our stay is comfortable with great service.  The downside in my opinion is the room style looks dated, but well maintained anyways. The housekeeping may be from mainland China, so he speaks little english. Breakfast can be better. it has some variety but tasteless and never hot, dont know why.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Very nice place, but not that wow",

"Can't say enough about this great hotel. Certainly one of my all time, world-wide favorites. Two pools (lap for adults, roof with toys for kids). Extremely well trained and friendly staff that cater wonderfully to families with small children. When we arrived our room had the kid cot (free) already set-up, cookies and apple juice, and special kids soap in the bathroom just for our son. Location just of Orchard Rd but with a direct inside passageway to the road was perfect. My only small complaint is that the beds are a bit too soft for my liking.

To cut a long story short we were booked in at another hotel who lost our booking.  The Four Seasons arranged for us to stay with them and when we arrived at midnight had a cool refreshing drink waiting for us.  They made us feel special and welcome.  And even apologised to us for the poor service at the other hotel.  We were upgraded to an amazing room.  The room is serviced twice daily and is in top condition.  We would recommend staying here without hesitation.  The concierge is knowledgeable and guided us well and will arrange anything you wish to attend.

I booked 2 rooms. 1 room is available after 15-20 mins. The reception told me that they will call my room after the other room is ready. I waited for 2 hours and yet there is no call. I went down to the reception and asked for the key and the room is still unavailable at 5 PM. They told me it will be available after I went out. At 6 PM the room is available.

The rooms are a decent size, very clean and materials used for the bedding etc are top quality as you would expect from a the Four Seasons group. The problems start when you want the added extras ... In room water bottles cost SGD$12++, a cappuccino from room service cost SGD$15++. Basic barely useable Wifi was included in the price of the room, however, if you wanted faster internet you need to spend and extra SGD$25++ a day. Don't get me wrong, the hotel, service, decor is great, but rationalising spending so much for extras which cost you a fraction of the price once you step outside the hotel is a big ask.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Nice Hotel, Extras will cost you an arm and a leg",
Choice & quality of food - both in room and restaurants was disappointing. Irrespective of whether it was a sandwich or India - both disappointed. 2nd stay at the hotel - first was even worse. I had ants creeping up all over the cookies in my room  during the first stay. At the price that I paid - it was definitely not value for money. Far better choices available in the same area.,2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Biz Travel to SGP - July 2015.,
Loved the 4 Seasons Singapore. No complaints. They took great care of us from transportation at the airport to the concierges to a nice lounge when we checked out and we're waiting for our flight. Very luxurious. The rooms were modern and lovely. Had the buffet breakfast downstairs and it was very elegant. The bike ride they offer was very nice too. You take a ride at 5:30 am while it is still dark and the roads are empty accompanied by 2 staff members and they have bikes delivered to the hotel for you. It was a lot of fun and they couldn't have been more gracious.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A nurturing oasis,
From the moment we arrived until our departure we received excellent service. Staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Our room was large and very comfortable especially the beds. My wife and I were travelling with our 12 year old granddaughter and there was plenty of space in the one room with a comfortable roll away. The breakfast buffet had plenty of options and the food and service was excellent. Location at the top end of Orchard Road was nice and quiet but close enough to the MRT and other facilities. Free in room WiFi kept us in contact with home. We would recommend this hotel to those who are looking for a friendly 5 star experience in Singapore.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Fantastic stay, excellent staff and facilities.",
Amazing hotel.  5 stars may be underrating it.  Room was first class.  Staff was the best I may have ever encountered.  It has a fresh clean new feel to it even though I am sure it is not a brand new hotel.  If you are looking for the best hotel in Singapore you need no go any further.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great week in Singapore in the best hotel in Singapore,
"Very convenient location, at the city center, you can walk around even if you only have 15 spare minutes. Rooms are very nice, big, nicely decorated, and bathroom is extremely nice too (better than other luxury hotels around I where have also been). The service is extremely good, efficient, gentle. Able to check-out in the morning and still use the gym in the afternoon, very convenient for Europeans taking night flights.  Restaurant is a bit expensive, but to get a cheaper option you just need to walk 2 minutes: many nice restaurants very close.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Nice hotel, rooms are big and in very good condition, very good service",

"This was my second stay at a four seasons and the service was impeccable and personal - which sets them apart from other five star hotels. The attention to detail was great, the room attendant noticed we had forgotten our toothpaste and gave us one as complimentary. Location is great to shops and to travel to tourist areas. Concierge very helpful and efficient with help in planning our itinerary to checking us in on our flights. Breakfast was very good too!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Impeccable service,
"I stayed here for 2 nights and was impressed by the great service. I was told that I could only check in at 2 pm but when I arrived at 12.30 pm they let me check in. The bed was big and the bathroom was fantastic. I took my bath and went out. When I came back at about 6, I was surprised to find out that the room service came to replace my towel and tidied my room. The same thing happened the next day. There were an ironing board, iron, a safe and clothes hangers in the closet. The wifi is super fast. You need to walk for about 10 minutes to get to the MRT station. You can't get food near the hotel unless you walk to the main road. This city is surely one of the safest in the world so walking to the MRT and around alone and even late at night is nothing the be worried about. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Stay,

"Although on the fringe of Orchard Road, I like the location, as it just feels less frenetic, without being far. The Hotel itself is smaller than the norm in Singapore, which makes it a bit cozy. The service is excellent, the rooms spacious and well appointed and the tariff is not unreasonable. The dinning options are a bit limited but then it is a short walk to a plethora of choice in the Orchard Road vicinity. I like it! ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent choice in the Orchard Area,
"This was our second visit to Four Seasons in Singapore and we were once again enchanted by its calm, welcoming atmosphere, the charming staff and real comfort of the room. From the luxuriant flowers in the lobby, the utterly cloud-like bed and thoughtful room extras (tea and coffee facilities, an iron) to its wonderful breakfast selection, we could not have been happier. It is also very conveniently located to walk to all the shopping one could want and a short (and very cheap) cab ride to the Marina Bay or river areas. We recently stayed at Four Seasons in Sydney, also very nice, but Singapore is definitely in a class of its own.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Luxury and comfort in the heart of Singapore,
"We stayed five nights in April and have nothing but great memories of this hotel. Housekeeping was absolutely fantastic and the room was spotless. They even tied our device cables and wiped our phone and iPad screens. Service was excellent all around including front desk, concierge and pool staff. I would not stay anywhere else in Singapore.  Location was within walking distance to the metro yet not directly on Orchard but just behind the Hilton. Perfect for a low key, elegant and quiet stay. We are now big fans and will look to book other Four Seasons during our travels.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Wow, one of our best stays ever!",

Family pool on the roof is a bit small but is ok. General service / friendliness of staff was below expectations, e.g. the person responsible for hailing taxis. Overall it was a pleasant enough stay, just not up to the very high standards that I would normally expect from this brand.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,All about location,

The Easter Sunday was a surprise which my son enjoyed.   Although not on orchard rd, it is barely a 5 min walk to all the shopping you can handle.  Great place to stay.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great comeback,
"I enjoyed a truly wonderful three-day stay at this beautiful hotel two weeks ago.  Excellent and very spacious accommodations.  Flawless and cheerful service from all staff members.  Free and fast in-room WiFi.  Only a five-minute walk to an extremely convenient subway line, and very close to great shopping, etc. while being removed by one quiet block from all of the noise and congestion.  Great location.  One thing for which I was very grateful was the use of their lovely spa facilities for showering and changing purposes hours after I had checked out.  Although my departure flight was not until 9:30 pm, I was able to enjoy the full day exploring Singapore before returning to the hotel to freshen up before going to the airport.  Much appreciated.  Highly recommended hotel.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Wonderful hotel in great location, with free WiFi",
"I switched to the Four Seasons a couple of years ago for my Singapore trips. The service is still great . The property is showing its age. The gym is cramped , the treadmills need replacing and the gym should be expanded to take up some of the lounge space that no one seems to use. The one ninety restaurant is showing its age now so time for the owner to spend some $$$, compared to other hotels in the region ,,like the Mandarin in KL, they need to spend some serious $$ to complement their service as at over $500 per night I expect a bit more in terms of standard, and get it both regionally and globally .",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A new season needed !,

My room steward noticed that I saved the orchid which arrived each day with room service breakfast -- I placed them around the room to brighten my personal space as I love flowers. A few days into my stay, I arrived to my room one evening to find a beautiful, huge blooming orchid plant awaiting me, with a kind note from the staff hoping the gift enhanced my stay since they could tell I appreciated orchids. THAT is what the Four Seasons Singapore is all about -- fantastic!  Also, room service was incredibly fast -- American-based hotels could take note. :)",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Anticipates your needs, delights you at every opportunity",

Upon getting off the transfer at the lobby of the hotel, the desk (at the outside of the hotel) is already waiting with your room key. With some verification, you're straight off to your room; no hassles at all. Large and spacious rooms, strong wifi connection, complemented with a decent late night room service dining menu, just makes this hotel a business traveller's dream hotel. Situated just at the fringe of the CBD, accessibility is easy. The restaurants within the hotel caters to a variety of tastes. Being at the fringe of the shopping district, also has its shopping and dining advantages. Overall there is nothing to complain about. Seriously, give it a try when you're in Singapore next.

"It was some 25 years since our last visit to Singapore and my first time at the Four Seasons. Located on Orchard Boulevard near the corner of Scotts and Orchard Roads, its location is superb being close to shops and Orchard MTR. From the moment of our arrival and a welcome drink from the attentive check in staff we felt at home.  Our room was superb.  The bathroom could fit a rugby team and was spotless. Room service was impeccable.  I returned from a day's sightseeing to find a note from the room staff saying that they noticed that the book I was reading did not have a bookmark so they provided one. Is that service or not? We had a buffet breakfast included in our rate and I would say it was the best we have ever had and the competition is tough.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, great staff, great location",
"From the moment we walked in, we knew this was the perfect place. Yes, the Four Seasons is a little more expensive than other hotels in Singapore and it's a little out of the way, but the property more than makes up for those factors.  We were there for one night before a 7 week cruise and wish we would have planned on more. The restaurant is delightful and offers an array of local foods, as well as western.  The room was perfection. What a great way to start our trip!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfection!,

Needless to say we were fully satisfied. Excellent service from checking in to checking out. We arrived just before 9 am (due to my early arrival from Europe) and were granted an early check in, Staff were very professional and accomodating. The hotel was very beautiful with antiques everywhere. We stayed at a spacious Premier Room at 19th floor and had plenty of room between us.

"I travel a lot for business and stay at many 4 and 5 star hotels.  The reason I am taking the time to write a review for the Four Seasons in Singapore is that they consistently exceeded my expectations, especially on the little things that make you truly feel welcome.  They managed to get my room service order exactly right (despite several special requests) every morning.  The concierge made you feel truly welcome and like she was just there to help you enjoy your stay - not to earn a commission.  The rooms were nice and the bed is very comfortable.  The pool is beautiful, but as a business traveler with not a lot of spare time, I would absolutely come back just for the attentive staff which made me feel truly welcome and at ease.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Stellar staff and service,

What I Liked: - very cosy and warm feel as soon you enter the hotel - the best sleep I had in Singapore compared to Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental! - iPhone dock next to the TV which charges your phone but also allows you to play your music on the room speakers - very cool - Etro toileteries - Double doors to the bathroom makes it feel grand and good shower - Apples for you to pick up in the elevator lobby - It is walking distance to ION Mall which is the newest one on Orchard   What I did not like - Compared to the other hotels I stayed (mentioned above) the room felt smaller - No views to talk about,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Boutique hotel feel very close to Orchard,

I could not be more pleased with the rooms and service of the hotel. The rooms are so elegantly furnished, very large in size and the bathrooms divine.  The concierge was especially helpful. I would give her extra bonus for making our stay enjoyable.

Staff at the hotel pamper their guests without impacting on privacy, with grace and professionalism.  Children are indulged in a kids club, great food and xmas with Santa and the choral choirs was magnificent.

I have stayed at the Four Seasons multiple times and several while our meetings were held elsewhere because of the consistently high quality of service no matter how you measure it.

Not your dark hip hotel with music thumping where the lobby turns into a disco at night.  Just your classic quality hotel where everyone remembers your name and your preferences.

Included basic wifi - or an option to purchase higher speed - the regular access was fine for email and basic web stuff.   A bonus was a nice - but very humid - run through the botanical gardens in the early AM.  The bellhop offered a map with a nice running loop which went through the gardens and some neighborhoods,  Felt perfectly safe running along (as a female) before dawn.

Four Seasons, Singapore's service is simply world class.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,World class in the heart of Singapore,
"I love this hotel, it has class, The suites are impeccable, the service cannot be better, the Chinese restaurant is out of this world, the bar is cozy, the breakfast international, the shopping world class, the gym state of the art and the location with its walkway to the Hilton on Orchard street just fantastic. I would live in this hotel all year round if I could. Thank you 4 Seasons year after year.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Probably the Best,
"I stayed at the hotel for single night during my business trip. The location is nice with decent sized rooms. I would like to specially mention a word about the reception staff. It took them little longer since another customer before me had various inquiries. At the time of my check-in, reception staff apologized for the delay and they offered me a glass of juice in order to make up for the that. This shows their focus on serving each customer with perfection, which i really liked. The room service was great and quick and they have lot of vegetarian options with buffet and food worth every SGD. The only reason for 4 stars is that room did not have a great view, the probable reason was they gave room to me on 6th floor. However, it's worth the stay at the price of the stay!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good stay!,
"The REGENT SINGAPORE , a 4 Seasons Hotel, is ideally situated in Cuscaden Road OFF Orchard Road,is a delight to review. The situation was brilliant - just a 10 minute walk to Orchard  MRT (Metro) station and the whole City is accessible. The Building is new, well laid out & decor sumptuous . The rooms are really SUPERIOR quality. Most of all, the Staff were so obliging and friendly. We stayed for 2 nights on a ROOM & CONTINENTAL breakfast package. This was not Coffee, juice and cold meats, it was FULL ENGLISH, FULL ASIAN -  FULL EVERYTHING in fact. We cannot speak HIGHLY enough of this HOTEL, a treasure in the East!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Five Star Hotel  - Area, Building & Service",
"The Four Seasons is located in the middle of Orchard road, close to all the malls one would like to go. The subway is located a block away as well, making it easy to go around SG. Do note that you may have to hike a little bit (100 metres) at an incline coming from Orchard. However, there is another route inside the hotel, connecting it with the Hilton.  The hotel room is very big. It may require a renovation soon but it's very well maintained. The staff are friendly and would gladly help their guests.

Prices of services and food are not best, but quite compatible with the city.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,top level service,
"Stayed for three night last week. Located at the heart of the city make it really enviable, accessible practically from anywhere. It is unfortunate that due to my air sickness, I did not go to the pool and fitness centre, the two places that I never miss when staying at a hotel. The breakfast was quite superb with a wide choice of variety but hot food was not that plenty as in Shangri la or other five star hotel. My room has a view toward Orchard Road which is truly beautiful throughout the day. The level of service is world class, upon check out, my luggage is already kept inside the taxi while I am having breakfast. Never experience something like this before!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A hotel at the heart of Singapore,

The rooms are huge and comfort with all the amenities. The pool and the spa area are very nice. The staff  and the service are at a very high class. I asked for an extra bed for my child. They told me that they will charge me for 80SD per night plus tax. I agreed. During checkout I was told that they decided not to charge me for the extra bed. ""Small money"", but a huge gesture. This is one of the reasons for staying at the Four Seasons where ever I can....They make us feel wonderful. We will recommend this hotel to all our family members and freinds. No doubt that we will be back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A perfect hotel at a prime location.,

"Don't get me wrong, the hotel is very good, but having visited recently other FS in Asia, this one is not one of their top properties.

We were fortunate enough to stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore during our recent conference.  Staff were incredible - they are so helpful and remember who you are ... definitely the calibre of the property that comes with these extra special touches!  Great buffet breakfast - all sorts of goodies to try out - although the layout is somewhat spread from one end of the restaurant to the other ... still enjoyed it!  Room was wonderful - amazing beds and pillows ... you climbed on in and found it very difficult to get back out again.  The newly renovated family pool area provides a little oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Singapore.  Easy access to Orchard Road and shopping ....!!!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Definately a luxury stay ...,
"As soon as we arrived we were greeted with nothing but smiles. During check-in the staff were kind enough to give us some cold towels and lemon tea (if you've experienced Singapore weather you'll understand how good this is). Later that night, after a few too many drinks and a midnight swim, we were looking for the best foods in town- one of the bell boys actually offered to go on his scooter get them for us and deliver them to our room. Instead, we all travelled together in the taxi and he helped us with the ordering.

It has the most amazing facilities including hot tubs, sauna and steam rooms but around the swimming pool you are frequently handed complimentary frapacinnos and iced face towels.  The rooms are huge and the beds are enormous and so comfortable.  Perfect location just off Orchard Road.  I would love to return to this hotel again and definitely recommend staying here!

Great hotel that is not so touristy & away from the hustle bustle of Orchard Ave. Excellent Rooms. Walking distance to other eating outlets which are open 24hours. Breakfast selection was good. Bathroom was spotless. Sleep 101 CD was provided for better sleep quality. The CD player was not working. Tried to take the CD out to play it on my notebook but the CD was stuck in there. Fortunately everything else was perfect & in working order,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice Quiet Hotel,

"This is a great hotel, well located for shopping and spacious rooms. The reception staff were friendly and efficient and we upgraded to a junior suite which was well worth the extra charge - large living area and a dining table along with a small cloakroom in addition to the bathroom. Beds are amazingly comfortable. The gym is good, the rooftop pool brand new and there is a 'Club' area with refreshments on floor 3. Breakfasts options are endless and catered to my fussy tastes. We enjoyed the excellent g&ts at the ninety one bar also. On check out, which was a day earlier than planned, the staff were accommodating and professional. Overall my stay exceeded my expectations and is an experience I would highly recommend. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Stay here - great location and service ,

Not a nice breakfast experience.  All in all, we had a good stay.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect location close to Orchard Road..,
"The FS Singapore is a relaxing and calming spot just steps away from the famous Orchard Road.  We arrived mid morning from the US and were pleased when our spacious corner room was ready before noon. Take advantage of the 3rd floor lounge era where you will find teas, coffee and treats throughout the day. The newly renovated 20th floor pool is fantastic and you can enjoy a wonderful view of the city. My daughter happened to be turning 13 later that week (after our stay) and the staff sent up a birthday cake as well as cookies and drinks.  We had not even told them it was her birthday!

The only disappointment was the swimming pool which is very small.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,FLAWLESS!,

Internet connection in room Is free but very low quality, you can buy another one for 25$ , I didn't try but probably it works,  also in restaurant internet is good.

"One more fantastic Four Seasons hotel! There is nothing to complain, a very nice, perfectly located city hotel. Just 5 minutes away from the best Shopping mall in Singapore. The prices are reasonable and our children were very welcomed (not usual in Singapore). The Concierge service was very professional and helped us choosing the right activities with the kids and even booked tickets for us. The rooms are classic but very nicely decorated and in a perfect condition. The whole hotel smells like a Spa - very inspiring. Housekeeping is amazing and very friendly.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic city hotel,
"Stayed in Four seasons at the start of August. Wasn't too impressed with the quality of service. 1. water in the shower is too hot, even if you turn the knob to full cold 2. housecleaning was pathetic - one day, the cleaning cloth was left on the table, another day i found a big hair in the towel. 3. Walls seem to be really thin, i could hear people next door 4. pool is really small - not worthy of a 5 star hotel 5. quality of toileteries doesn't have a premium feel  some of the things i liked - location is good, next to Orchard road - room service is quick and food quality is very good - wifi speed is good",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Average experience,
"Stayed a night with family and relatives and was expecting great service with such a highly rated hotel brand but boy was I wrong and much worst then the lower star hotels I've stayed in! Luggage was not brought up to the rooms as promised. Faulty room iphone charger - the staff asked us to go to the business centre to charge and when we asked to borrow one, only the cable was sent! Was expecting a little common sense here! Was charged for the children's breakfast when I was told by the restaurant staff that it was included with my stay. ",1.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Total disppointment,
"To want to go back to a country for the warmth and care you have been showered with in a hotel, is the feeling you get after staying at the Four Seasons Singapore.  Extreme luxury and comfort, but service beyond comparison.

I felt nothing short of royalty at every moment during my stay as the staff managed to anticipate my needs and make arrangements to ensure my comfort and satisfaction at every moment.  The breakfast was divine. If you're a sheik you will be satisfied. If you're anything less, you'll be impressed. Blueberries on the fruit salad, an amazing selection of european cheeses and... well it's all here including a solid soy cappucino.  I cannot say enough about this fantastic inner-city hotel, I am now eager to explore the Four Seasons brand in an ocean holiday context.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Brand lives up to itself,

I always check the traveler's pic of the bathroom hotel before i book the hotel but this time my husband who did the hotel book and i don't have time to check the pic because it's kind of last min. And i am very happy when i first saw the bathroom. It is very clean and big. The bedroom slippers are very nice too. They even gave us the kids amenities and the kids bathrobe was so cute. The buffet breakfast was so good either, compared to any hotel I've stayed at sg.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Hotel with great service,

The service at FS SG Is EXCELLENT. the rooms don't look great in photos but once you are inside one, everything about it is is so LUXE. i LOVE the bathrooms. The 190 bar is Amazing as well. The BEST gin tonics in the WORLD. They also have the BEST beds. The experience is HEAVENLY. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Still My Favorite Hotel,
"Stayed 2 nights in Aug, A classic hotel has 20 year history. Very good and warm service, attention to detail is one of the best. The pool is a little small but very relaxing.  Both restaurants have very fresh and tasty food, service is also excellent.  The door's sound isolation could improve, there's a gap below door and you can hear anyone talk in the corridor outside. When it's louder, it's even audible when you are in suite bedroom,  Do note they don't have executive lounge.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good stay,

On a bad side the restaurants are quite expensive and we had to walk to shopping centre for every meal, otherwise I will go again.

This means alot when travelling with kids and is greatly appreciated.

My only complaint would be that there is no shelter from sudden rain , which happensdaily , so I think that should be addressed I will be returning ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Did not disappoint,
"What always amazes me in Four season Singapore is the intuitiveness of the staff regarding the needs of their guest. They anticipate and therefore they gave a sense of relief or an assurance that everything is taken care of . My sister and I stayed here seven years ago and during that time and now, we had experimented with trendy accommodation in Singapore and our conversation always goes back how we are well taken cared of during our stay here. I would say that this hotel has one of the best well trained staff .Furthermore, my appreciation also goes to the staff of the Chinese restaurant during a weekend brunch buffet , they really make us very comfortable and the lunch enjoyable and worthy of  sibling anecdotal party conversations.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,'Til We Meet Again,

I can't comment on the pool or fitness area, which normally we would use. But our room was large and spacious, the location difficult to beat (first stop: Ion) and our meal at the in-house Chinese restaurant - chosen out of convenience because of the lateness of our arrival - far exceeded expectations (particularly the duck). Breakfast was outstanding with its local food selections.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A typical Four Seasons experience - very little left to chance,
"I've stayed at other Four Seasons properties before but I must say that The Four Seasons in Singapore has the best service.  We arrived before our room was ready and I had to prepare for a meeting. The Filipina lady at the front desk was nice enough to arrange for me to freshen up at the Spa. They even had someone come up to iron the dress I was going to use.  The person that impressed me the most was this woman from housekeeping who was in charge of the pressing. She was so knowledgeable about fabrics and how to care for them. I could tell she took a lot of pride in her job.  The property itself is not so new, but it nevertheless it's still aging gracefully. The elevator takes a while to get you up and down between floors. for instance.  It was a pleasurable stay all-in-all.  ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Service,

The service at this hotel is excellent. Staff are friendly but not servile and we were recognised and acknowledged at all times.

It was however well appointed with all we could desire.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent for service,
"The Four Seasons Singapore fails to live up to it's globally renowned brand name. Although the rooms are uber luxurious and comfortable, the fitness area is far from five star while the pool is non descript and tiny and fails to warrant a comment. What needs a prompt change are the bathroom accessories which are packed in rainbow coloured tubes an absolute misfit for a business hotel of such repute. Imagine your bath soap packed in a bright green wrap. I almost expected to see some candy pop out when I opened it. The service however is very good but for the price you pay, this is not unexpected.",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not worth the price you pay. The fitness area looks tired and dated and the pool is anything but inviting.,

"We commented that this Hotel did not provide facilities that allowed one to shower and freshen up before the late evening flight back to the UK. This was the only fault we found with the Four Seasons during our stay in May 2013.

I end up staying at Ritz because it is convenient to my office; however, if the location is not an issue, then, my second choice would be Four Season.  It's bit of an old school but I like the atmosphere more than the Ritz.  Now with St Regis opening up, then, it's becoming more and more difficult to make the choice.  If I were on a business and with my wife; then, I would still stay at Ritz as it has a bigger swimming pool.  If I am on holiday in Singapore, then, I might stay at St Regis or Four Seasons.  More convenient for shopping.   Anyway, they are all good hotels and very difficult choice.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Ritz or Four Seasons (or St Regis)?,
"The hotel facilities are very nice and clean, as you would expect at a top level hotel, but it is the outstanding service that sets the Four Seasons apart.

Hotel still generally in good condition, especially public areas. our rooms seemed spruced up from last time; brighter bathrooms, better TV etc. Superb staff, very impressive throughout. Food markedly better than last time too. Breakfast very good (from very bad last time out), but still not worth it. It isn't 'that' good! Bar menu tasty with some great options.

I also really enjoy its classic simplicity, it's not over the top and vulgar.  The pool is quiet and has a good view of the city.  The gym is clean and one of the better one's I've been to for city-based hotels.  I love being so close to Orchard Rd, but having just enough distance that you are removed from all the traffic.

"Nice hotel for business, couples. Not too fun for kids. Luxurious room and bathroom with locitane as a complimentary. Nice and strategic location. Wifi inside the room. Apple everywhere. Nice breakfast. Overall, very satisfied. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Amazing classic luxurious hotels in strategic location,
We stayed three nights with our four kids. Pluses: great service - difficult to fault and they go the extra mile (e.g. made pancakes and hash browns specially for our kids for breakfast); good location 5 minutes from MRT and 2 minutes from Orchard Road; nice rooftop pool and jacuzzi; quality fixtures and fittings and an overall air of being well kept up. Minuses: quite an old building now (by Singapore standards) but it doesn't really show...just not quite as dazzling as some of the newer ones; not cheap. But if you are staying on holiday you won't be disappointed if you choose the 4 Seasons.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Service makes the difference,

We can't wait to return and enjoy the hotel and Singapore!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pre and Post Cruise Stay at the Four Seasons - Singapore,
"Disappointing guest experience especially given Four Seasons reputation for service and guest experience. Having stayed at the Ritz Carlton Singapore, the St. Regis Singapore, and the Shangrila Singapore (I average 8 nights per quarter in Singapore hotels), I had high expectations for the Four Seasons given its world-renowned reputation for service. Unfortunately, it was very disappointing from arrival to checkout to departure. The lack of overall engagement by the staff with creating a warm, memorable and welcoming guest experience was apparent. Hopefully, they can remedy the situation and restore the Four Seasons experience.",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Disappointing guest experience especially given Four Seasons reputation for service and guest experience.,

"Four Seasons properties are all just outstanding.  While the location and facilities are always superb, it is the consistently outstanding and personalized service that makes staying at the Four Seasons worth it.  The Singapore property is centrally located, quiet location but you can walk through the neighboring Hilton and come out right on Orchard Road.  Wonderful restaurants, easy vehicle access for pick up and drop off.  Outstanding staff, personalized service.  Old school courtesy and service.  Very nice gym facility.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Wonderful, as you would expect",
"Our stay at this hotel was wonderful. The room was spacious, the bed heavenly and the bathroom large and lovely. But the best part was the service. I could not have been better. When we checked in I asked if they could contact Singapore airlines because I left a jacket and scarf onboard. They contacted SIA and located the items and had them sent out to the hotel the same evening. Exceptional. Would def stay here again. Location near Orchard road is also great.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic.,
"Checked into the hotel this afternoon and everyone was extremely helpful.  We upgraded the room and were delighted with the size of the room.  The negatives that I see is that the wallpaper is coming off the wall in numerous places, the rug in the bathroom is dirty, and the baseboard around the room is very dusty.  The chair and ottoman is old and very tired as well as dirty.  Our expectations staying at a Four Seasons are higher than what the standards are at the Singapore Four Seasons.  I think we could have done much better at another 5 star hotel.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A little disappointed,
"This is my 2nd time at this property and if I'm in the city and can afford it I won't stay anywhere else but here. And I've stayed at many of the top hotels in the Orchard Road vicinity.  My travel company www.fourwaystravels.com booked me a boulevard room then managed to get me an upgrade to the executive suite. The hotel is beautiful, the room, bathroom, amenities, equipment are absolutely top notch. The service is beyond anything I've experienced elsewhere. Every single member of the staff recognizes you by name, all the time. They are extremely courteous and can't wait to go out of their way to help you.  The location is absolutely perfect for Orchard road too.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The perfect hotel experience once again at Four Seasons Singapore. I love this hotel and the personalised service,

The rooms have all the best amenities expected of a top hotel; the beds are super soft, and the shower is exceptionally good.  Whether you go to the gym, pools, or any of the lounges, there are friendly professional staff on hand to provide refreshments and anything else you may wish for. There is a great ambience and quality about this hotel that makes you feel very comfortable, and safe. This is not a ""low cost"" hotel, but you do get the best quality for what you pay for. The only criticism(a minor one only) is that the tiles in the 2 pools are somewhat slippery, and you need to take care with this.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Everything just great,

Comfy pool cabanas.  Reasonable telephone rates to the US....less than Verizon....did not use cellphone.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Gorgeous property,
"Recently stayed a total of five nights at the Four Seasons...three on our first stay and two on our return.  In both cases, the rooms were lovely...spacious, beautiful bathrooms, quiet, comfortable bedding. First room contemporary, second more traditional. The service is second to none.  Requests were handled immediately and the room service was excellent.  The hotel staff was warm and welcoming...always a smile and a greeting.  Loved the location of the hotel...just a bit off the beaten path but a stone's throw to Orchard Road, shopping and excellent transportation.  The breakfast was superb and, once again, the service perfection.  The adorable Lien Tran greeted us on our return with enthusiasm and delight and I felt I had come home.

I would certainly return on my next trip to Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Professional, friendly excellent service.",
"All-round a good experience at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore. A cosy place with fantastic service standards tucked away 3-5 min walking distance from Singapore's shopping district. However, the rates were awfully high. Granted that it was during the Singapore Airshow week, but I had stubbled upon another 5 star hotel within walking distance for about 40% cheaper (and certainly not 40% less value by any standards). Nonetheless, I would still recommend the hotel to friends/family.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Good hotel, great service and staff, though somewhat overpriced",

They know ur name and the staff will greet u , they will know what drink u had so u may like that again, they will offer etc. The look in general is classic , it was done long time ago but impeccably maintained . It's small and most of all, because if size , not chaotic , the personnel has time to manage all customers . We will definitely stay to the same again and strongly recommend it too. They are many new ones but this one has a personalised service , and for those flying , get the limo transfer , they wait for u at the door of the plane !",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Impeccable ,
"I stayed here with my family for several times on connecting door rooms. Well, it's a posh hotel with big & clean room, very big bathroom, and very decent breakfast buffet. The bed and duvet were super lovely, the perfect remedy for our backache and tired leg after hanging around all day in Singapore. Very close to Orchard Rd., that's a very plus point for a shopping trip!  But, well..this is a posh hotel. Definitely not recommended for those who travel to Singapore with budget.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,decent posh hotel,
"I stay at the Four Seasons in Singapore every now and then.  Service is good, and staff are very responsive to customer needs.

The manager Antoine Chahwan, after listening to us, more than made up for it!!! He  and the entire hotel staff really took special care of us for the duration of our stay. We had a wonderful experience and knew we made the right decision by choosing Four Seasons. We strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who values great service.

"The Four Seasons Hotel Singapore has fantastic art work and some of the best food I have had. With two pools,  indoor and outdoor tennis courts, a small waterfall, a fully equipped gym and beautiful rooms, who could want more.  It is also on a quiet street and it is walking distance from lots of shopping, though I especially like the Tanglin Shopping Centre nearby.  The views from the rooms and the roof are spectacular.  The staff is well informed, helpful and easy readily available. It is great both for business travelers and vacationers and especially couples where the eleventh floor has been designated especially for couples.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons Hotel Singapore is a wonderful place to stay,
"The hotel is a bit outdated, but the location was very convenient. It's small which offers a lot of privacy and intimacy. Breakfast has many choices.

"There is nothing wrong with this hotel but as a luxury hotel it does nothing to exceed expectations.   The staff are friendly and the hotel lobby is quite impressive, but the rooms look quite tired and are in need of a refresh.   The hotel is lacking ambiance and seems more suited to a business traveller than holiday makers. The staff did, however, provide us with a beautiful cake to congratulate us, as we were visiting on our honeymoon, which was much appreciated. The breakfast is also very good.   Note: There are two Four Seasons in Singapore. Our taxi driver initially took us to the wrong one, so make sure you double check the address!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Good hotel, if a little bland",
check in was delayed if i wanted a room upgrade otherwise was able to give me my prebooked room right away even though it was around 3pm. upgraded room was rather awkward - no windows in bedroom and only twin beds. lobby restaurant was only choice as other one was closed for renovations.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,generally very good all round,
Faultless from arrival to departure. I was there on business and the location is a little removed from the CBD and the new Bay Financial Area. However unless it's raining cabs are available and the journey is quite quick. For me it was nice to return to the hotel and the relative quiet of the area.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,All round great stay,
"I originally planned to stay here for the entire week while I was in Singapore for business. However, I only stayed here for one night and checked out earlier. The reason is mainly the inconvenient location to business district. You need to take a cab and the waiting time is highly uncertain every morning during the peak hour. When I came downstairs to check out, I let the concierge know that I wanted to take a cab, however, they didn't get me in the queue until I finished check out five minutes later. Even though it's nothing big, I just thought that the service is not as good as what you usually expect from four seasons.   If you are here for business, I'd rather not recommend this one...",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very average experience at the four seasons,
"I stayed here for a week as part of a conference. We were all really delighted. The rooms were spotless, modern, and of good size. The swimming pools and gym were very nice.

Very clean hotel, very comfortable bed and good air con in the room to keep it at the right temperature.  Staff at the hotel were all fantastic, very helpful, friendly and always smiling. From check in to departure I was really well looked after. I will stay at this hotel on every future trip I make to Singapore. Very sad to leave such a lovely place.

"Everything is done Top Notch!  My husband and I had a wonderful experience staying here. My first trip and his one of many. He always chooses to stay here when traveling to Singapore. It is a beautiful hotel and it gives you a very calm and quiet stay. The staff is very helpful and treats you with utmost respect. Breakfast has all that you would want and very yummy! The restaurant serves the most amazing dish Crispy Aromatic Duck. It is roasted and shredded served on thin white pancake with plum sauce, thin sticks of spring onion and cucumber. It is like a duck fajita. I am not a huge fan of any other duck choices but this is Delicious!  The location is great, close to Orchard street shopping, just a hop skip and jump away.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top Notch!,
"Nice decor and lovely room but at $500 a night I'd expect breakfast and wifi as standard. Amazing that a hotel aiming at this standard should adopt a 'Ryan Air' approach to everything other than just sleeping. My advice: stay here if you like the location, but don't eat, drink, or use the internet. Chiseling isn't the word ",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Expensive,
"Took my family for easter to meet with relations from Australia who also stayed here. From the efficient ,friendly pickup by the hotel limo at the airport to our return we had fabulous service. All the staff were friendly and often had jokey banter with my children.

"We loved this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. My husband left and we all shared a room, no problem. Breakfast buffet missed, have it take away on the way to the airport. They were fantastic. The rooms were a good size and three minutes from Orchard Rd.  My one gripe could be that that the pool lady was a bit over efficient and not that nice to the children - I felt like we were an intrusion on her territory. Food and drinks were expensive with a pool side lunch for three (two meals being kids small ones) and three drinks costing $96 SNG but I am starting to think that's just standard for a five star property.  We loved the rasberries on the breakfast buffet and the beds were super comfortable.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This is a great hotel,
From the moment of our arrival all the management team was very attentive to us and service they produced was impeccable. Suite is very comfortable. Just one thing: breakfast was really overpriced and very poor. As for me I was so impressed with full size olympic size swimming pool in the hotel with a stuff which trying to predict your every wish. Not to mention that everything from towels to freshly squeezed juice was perfect. Fairwell which was organised to us by porters team on our departure was so nice and warm which will be very hard to forget and I am looking forward to be back to this hotel.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent,
"While I went for a business trip to Singapore, this hotel kind of came across as more off-business kinds. It is located in a fairly quiet location on the Orchard Road. Pretty and clean rooms. However, laundry is a serious rip-off - I reiterate this - it is very expensive! Other than that, it was good. Breakfast spread was alright - cold cuts were quite less and cold breakfast range was small.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Good rooms, expensive services..",
"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel though my previous experiences at Four Seasons in other countries was better. There are at least 2-3 top-quality hotels in Singapore that offer higher 5-star quality standards. For example, the pools (there are 2) are less luxurious and attractive to spend time around than I had expected. The dining experience is also quite limited. In my opinion: very good hotel but not good enough for the Four Seasons quality label. The bar next to the breakfast/dining area is nice and has all you need in terms of food and drinks. Service was very good throughout the hotel and the room was also very good quality and size.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Very good, not excellent",

Location is great as it is away from orchard rd, but only short stroll to the main strip through the Hilton. Breakfast was also one of the best in-room brekky's i have had till date.

It is very conveniently located in waking distance to ION Orchard, but it is also easy to get a drive to the Zoo or any other location.  The rooms are spacious and well maintained. The afternoon tea is something we would highly recommend to try, we never miss it.

The things I less like: although  it is close or Orchard Road and the shopping area but it is far away from the financial/business center, less convenient for business travelers. It is also farther away from the airport than hotels in Marina Bay. The hotel does not provide tooth brushes and combs - make sure you bring your own.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Typical Four Seasons,
The hotel is in a good location being just walking distance from Orchard MRT station and set among some wonderful foliage.

The service by far is the best service I have received, the staff went out of there way to make my 5 year old something that wasn't on the in room dining menu and the concierge desk booked all our tickets for universal and the night safari, the door staff were attentive and polite every member of staff we met were genuine, helpful and polite.  Looking forward to trying another four seasons hotel.  The Chauhan Family",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best service,
Just checking out after 5 fantatsic days rounding off a perfect family vacation. Zoltan (reception manager) and the team did a great job from the moment we arrived to departure. A fabulous suite on arrival with extra beds in palce for the kids (7 and 10 yr old daughters). Location is excellent! Transporatation no issue. ION shopping mall and other shops very close with a link through to Orchard road via connection with adjacent Hilton. Family pool on roof top is great! Fitness suite and spa not to be missed.Great location to expolore this wonderful city state.We will be back!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,An outstanding experience,
This maintains the expected standard.  Extremely high service.  Everyone knows your name when you check in and need anything.  Good location. Easy walk to the botanical gardens and cab ride to other locations.  a very good stop on your trip through the far east.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Classic Four Seaons - Service excellent.,
"I stayed Four Seasons Hotel and Resort Singapore for 8 nites with family and would say excellent service makes the hotel oustanding.  From house keeping (Thank you, Mrs. Tien Sing, for your attentive care to my family during our stay in FS) in-room dining to club service, staffs are very professional, willing to help.   We enjoyed the room, tennis courts and great location of the hotel. Nice and quiet up-hill surroundings though just a short stroll to shopping areas. There's also a jogging path outside the hotel up to Botanic Garden.  Not so impressed with the Chinese restaurant on 2nd fl. We liked room service and One-Ninety much more.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent service makes the hotel outstanding,
"It's been 10 years since my last visit to this property. It underwent significant renovation, but preserved the essence of colonial style. The lobby and cafe whisper quiet luxury, in contrast to many modern hotels which scream ""new wealth"".   The premier room is sizeable, though sparsely decorated, it is equipped with a double closet with plenty of storage space. Bathroom is very spacious with separate toilet compartment. It is lined with pink marble which brings back memories of a Roman palazzo.   Four Seasons is at the heart of the busiest shopping district in Singapore. Just minutes of walk away from Orchard Road and Scotts Road, which boast giant malls such as ION, Takashimaya and Paragon.   Hotel service is typical Four Seasons standard. In a word - excellent.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nostalgia of colonial days,
"This hotel is walking distance to the main shopping center Orchard Road and MRT Orchard station. The staff are very friendly , and lending a hand for tourist. My boyfriend and I were having a late lunch at the one ninety restaurant on the main lobby. I had my tourist book and map to figure sightseeing. The waitress took notice and offered his help. He also recommended  Level 33 lounge that has the best view of the bay and went out of his way to print name and address of this bar.   We had the executive suite which was very spacious , excellent view and very clean. The laundry is quite expensive here as we had 4 shirts, underwear and the bill came to $130 SD!   Overall we had a wonderful trip!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Executive suite -Enjoyable, Luxurious Hotel",
"This is an excellent hotel in the city of Singapore. Why were we disappointed? Having spent over four thousand Singapore dollars with this hotel in six days we were quoted 246 Singapore dollars for a late check out. Our flight out of Singapore was at midnight so we wanted to shower before the flight, needless to say we did not pay 246 dollars for a shower. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER FOUR SEASONS THIS IS UNREASONABLE TO SAY THE LEAST.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,246 DOLLARS FOR A SHOWER,
"Following the tradition of Four Seasons Hotel, we had no complaint regarding the service and attention to detail.  However, the hotel bar and restaurant needs renovation and the food needs some refinement.  Other than that, we very much enjoyed our stay and will be back.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Service but Hotel Needs a Facelift,
"Tucked away in a leafy boulevard yet a stone's throw from the heart of Orchard Road, a quiet welcome retreat. Interior is calming and restful, extremely comfortable beds, attentive yet unobtrusive service.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Quiet and elegant,
"The Four Seasons was a wonderful experience.  I had to go to Singapore unexpectedly on a family matter , there were 5 of us travelling. Normally this hotel would have been out of my price range , but somehow we got unexpectedly good rates! The staff were very attentive at all times. My only criticism they may have been too over zealous when clearing plates, before everyone had finished eating. The Interiors were tasteful and seating areas comfortable.The bedrooms and bathrooms spacious and luxurious with lovely additions as in L'Occitane soaps and creams and herbal teas. We had an early check out time, I was impressed that they had Teas, Coffee and small pastries laid out at such an early hour.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Welcoming,
"Last visit to this hotel. Four reasons not to stay at the Four Seasons in Singapore; 1. They overcharged on 2 seperates stays above their internet booking rates. 2. The breakfast buffet selection is very poor and overpriced. 3. Rooms are bright and clean but none of the expected 5 star frills, like fresh flowers and fruit. 4. Dingy bar area and lobby.",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Could try harder,
This is a beautiful hotel and staff is courteous and helpful. Love the fruit and appetizers on the floors near the elevator. The thing that Really brought it down in reviews is how noisy the halls and rooms are. I could hear everything going on around me and especially the staff as they cleaned rooms. Really very annoying when trying to stay in for an afternoon nap. I could hear all through the vents and walls.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,I give this 3 1/2,
"Spacious lobby with plentiful seating areas for meeting. Open plan, rather bland architectural space internally. Room fine, breakfasts bog-standard. Basically nothing special, and very expensive (even by Singapore standards).  Friendly staff, free wifi the highlights.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pretty standard business hotel,
"The Four Seasons hotel is just off Orchard Road (the main shopping street in Singapore) on Orchard Boulevard.  It is close enough to walk down for a spot of shopping and dining (via the adjacent Hotel).  Breakfast was the usual hotel spread of pastries (nothing exceptional, stodgy doughnuts), japanese, egg counter, noodle bar, porridge etc.  The rooms were spacious, bright and airy.  The hotel staff from reception, restaurant to housekeeping were friendly and efficient.  Altogether a pleasant stay.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay,
"Stayed at the lovely Four Seasons on Orchard Road. This hotel is fabulous. For starters, the breakfast buffet is second to none. Absolutely delicious with plenty of healthy options. The Four Seasons is conveniently located yet away from the hustle and bustle. A must stay if you are in SIngapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons does it again,
Whilst the hotel is a little bit older it is still an amazing venue and is under renovation. The suites are lovely and it's the small things the hotel has thought about for the comfort of guests. Will definitely be back,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic experience,
"Stayed here for a week on Business. Business room was perfect and the food delicious. Had two meals in the Chinese restaurant on the second floor. All the staff I met from the arrival area, reception, restaurant and Business areas were extremely helpful. The beedroms were spacious and very comfortable and the spa and sports facilities were also good. The Hotel was not as far away from Orchard road as I thought so if the hotel was quiet, you were in Orchard Road within 3 mins walk. Somehow though the Hotel lacked some atmosphere/buzz about it but perhaps that's not what Four Seasosn are about.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Business Hotel,
The bed/mattress here is the best ever! The hotel/rooms are impeccably clean and sparkling yet I found the hotel a bit dull and boring hence moved to st. Regis soon after. I suppose this is the perfect hotel for business travellers.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Impeccable yet boring!,
"Very good stay at the Four Seasons Singapore, the beds are fantastic! Concierge has been very helpful to print out important documents, just before going to the airport! Just a shame that they were not able to prepare a proper Old Fashioned at the bar (they put it in a shaker)! Ended up drinking Negroni's in stead.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Had a very short stay in Singapore (2 nights), but it was very nice! Exactly what you expect from a Four Seasons!",

"A wonderful room with excellent staff and service.  You know when a Hotel lists that they have a gym...and you walk in to find a couple of weights, a treadmill and not much else? Well not here at the Four Seasons! Was very well equiped with free weights, weight machines and a number of treadmills and cross-trainers. Even at peak time in the morning, you have the space and eqieipment you wanted. Free use of towels and free bottled water. No excuses not to get your pump on or work up a sweat.  As for the rooms, perfect. Spotless with every detail taken care of...even a turndown service.  All the staff were friendly and egar to make sure we were taken care of.  Would I stay there again - YES!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Large and comfy,
"The staff are without exception trained to a level no European hotel seems to aspire to. Within minutes of one's arrival, they all know your name on sight, arrival / departure date, and quickly come to learn one's preferences. They are unfailingly polite. Service is quick and smooth.

Location is very central for shoppers or business visitors.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,For Seasons Hotel Singapore keeps group's reputation for excellence,

Four Season hotels are great because of the staff and this hotel was great!  At least 3 people knew our names by the end of the first day.  You truly feel like you are in a club when you stay with Four Seasons.  Shopping is walking distance to one of the biggest malls in Singapore.  A cab ride to the new sands casino is on $10 and worth to see.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great hotel in Singapore,
"I was in Singapore for a meeting. Just over 24 hours, but the staff at the hotel were friendly and accomodating. The gentlemen at the door or the ladies at the Front Desk, always a pleasant smile and a wonderful attitude. The hotel was very busy with a dignatary from a European country, security, lots of people, ploce escorts, etc, but still they managed to make us all feel welcome. Many hotels failed to find the balance between looking after a VIP and the 'rest of the world"" not this hotel....well done",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,For business or pleasure a great place in Singapore.......,
"Absolutely cannot fault this hotel during our short stay.  Our expectations were exceeded in every respect from the moment we checked in to the moment we departed. That was when the Doorman inquired which airline we were flying with, and was able to direct the taxi driver to take us to a particular terminal drawing on his own knowledge of the airport. We were impressed. The room was beautifully furnished and service superb, with the shower the best we have experienced. A potted orchid in the bathroom was a nice touch. We have yet to encounter another centrally located hotel in a major city being able to boast not one but several tennis courts. FS Singapore is what every 5 star hotel should aspire to be. Well done!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Refinement and Service Par Excellence,
"High-end luxury hotels who really look after your children are hard to come by, but Four Seasons Singapore tops the list for us. They spoilt the kids with sensational welcome gifts, the kids room was heavily discounted and they supply children's amenities. But above all, the staff love kids and it really shows. Other luxury hotels rather not deal with kids, Four Seasons Singapore is different and they make the kids feel more spoilt than the adults :) Also, the rooms are one and a half times the size of regular hotel rooms which makes for a very comfortable stay with children.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Luxury Family Hotel,

"Lovely welcome including gift for our 2 1/2 year old daughter. We stayed in a suite and they had set it up with an extra bed in the lounge area. For families I would recommend a suite as it is huge, has 2 bathrooms, dining area and enough space to spread out. Breakfast was huge and a great selection - it does get busy but they have plenty of space. Swimming pool was nice with some toys for children and an excellent view over the city. Only surprise was the price of dry cleaning but this is a business hotel I suppose. Whilst the hotel was busy & aimed more at the business traveller we were made to feel welcome at all times and they could not have done more to make our stay any better as a family.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent,
"There were some mediocre reviews of this hotel on this site that nearly put us off booking, despite the fact that we regularly stay at Four Seasons hotels around the world and are part of their ""By Invitation"" loyalty programme. In fact the suite that they gave us was fabulous, and the service every bit as good as at any other if their hotels. It is well positioned right by Orchard Road and the subway station, and I would not hesitate to recommend it for a holiday or business stay in this rapidly developing city.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A good as ever,
"The room was a little aged, with sign of ageing especially in the bathroom. I didn't like the bathroom, with solid dark green marble - it felt like a modern sacrophagus! The bed was WAY too soft - so soft that I got a backache sleeping on it! Also, a toothbrush set doesn't come with the room and had to be specially requested. I was trying to order room service, and the menu was nowhere to be found. When my clam chowder arrived it was extremely disappointing - I think any tinned clam chowder would have tasted better! The lobby is also very poky. Didn't really like the place, especially for the price. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not up to expectation,
"We enjoy this hotel for it's unsurpassed understated elegance, privacy and residential location. Our preferred address in Singapore, close to everything making it easy to catch up with friends and entertain. The staff is absolutely wonderful!

"The concierge at this plase is amazing! And the service is presented, always with a smile. Location is good for Orchard Road and some serious shopping. Close to MRT. Did not have breakfast at the hotel. Rooms and lobby area is just as every other 5 star hotel. Very cute with child size robe, slippers and childfriendly shampoo. Gym was superb! And the aircon was a bless, REALLY quiet! :-D",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,It´s all about the service,
Dropped in for afternoon tea with my husband. We decided to sit in the Alfresco section and not inside where the air-con was way cold as with most outlets in Singapore.  Afternoon tea served on a traditional stand and not on a buffet  with a choice of TWG tea at $38++ per person was a pleasant surprise and sufficient.  Portions just nice  - not too much. The scones were a let down.They were heated up and then just became hard and dry. The rest of the items on offer were nice. Perfect place if you do not want noise and children running around.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Afternoon Tea @The Bar & Alfresco Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,
"We stayed just a night. The staff was always extremely friendly.The room was large and clean. The view was average (to a parking lot). The hotel - a short bit from the busy part of orchard road - offers a good location to be quickly anywhere.  The afternoon tea at the terrace is extremely good, you should try. But make sure to make a reservation to get a nice table, since it  seems to be quite popular, especially at the weekend. The hotel also has a nice pool, which was not crowded at all. The service at the pool (water, drinks, snacks) is also very good. The breakfast was something which was truly amazing. The hotel has an amazing variety of food and drinks to offer. It is difficult not to sit half the day.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Hotel,
The Four Seasons Singapore is well known for its excellent service. Breakfast is wonder ful and the location for shoppers perfect near the famous Orchard Road. For me the beds are by far too soft so that can be a problem if you have problems with your back.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good Service,
"Stayed for a week and cant fault anything - check in process was outstanding as was Concierge for any questions I had .The room was perfect, in room dining, roof top pool with the obligatory Singapore Sling were all  amazing and so close to Orchard Road for shopping!! Loved the late check out and swim before I left on the night of Singapore Independence Day after enjoying the festivities. Would suggest a Premier Room - best sleep and no noise. Also loved the Ming Dynasty displays throughout the Hotel.Cant wait to return.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Luxurious,
"Lobby areas are sane and comfortable, staff is good, room was good but expectations were a bit higher for us.  It's near time for updating the rooms but such easy access to nearby Orchard Rd for restaurants and shops makes it tolerable.  Room size was good, but sleep comfort could have been better as in sheets and bedding.  We had a view of the Tennis courts on a lower floor so nothing positive to say there.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,great location,
"The location, the service, the room, the ambience--all were perfect.  Well, maybe the room wasn't very high-tech...tv offerings were very limited, no in-room movies.  But that was the only negative I could mention.  We were there before Christmas and the hotel was decorated beautifully.  The staff was so friendly and accomodating that we didn't want to leave.   We had a package which included breakfast and one dinner--very well-prepared but very expensive if you had to pay extra for the meals.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,I love this hotel!,
its location is just perfect not too far from orchard street..everything u want is just 10 minutes by cab from there the metro station is also close by.. very nice staff..very helpfull too..the room was very comfortable the bed very amazingly soft..and the chinese restaurant was also really good..i would suggest anyone staying in this hotel to try the chocolate milkshake its amazing....,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,too good service,
"Simply wonderful hotel, great location.  One of my favourite hotels in the world, it's always a great personal welcome from the staff.  Rooms very comfortable and large.

"Stayed at hotel overnight, it lived up to our expectations. Consistently reliable high standard and service. Fantastic beds ! We stay at four seasons because they have THE most comfortable beds out of any of 5* hotels. Like sleeping on a cloud. Bed Linen has a luxurious silky feel, not the usual hotel standard issue. When travelling quality of sleep is important to us. it's No wonder they win industry awards for their beds!  Great location, can walk everywhere, close to shops & restaurants on orchard rd. no need for taxi's or a car.  Only complaint No free wifi !! Very disappointed. We travel all over the world and free wifi is now expected from the savvy traveller. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, fantastic beds, but no free wifi",
"This was our first stop in Singapore.  We were on our way to Australia.  The Four Seasons was fantastic.  It was just in the right position, close to the shops and restaurants however, for us, it was the standard of service that made it shine so brightly.    Every single member of staff we came into contact with was fantastic.  Our room was very big, the bathroom had an enormous shower.  There were plenty of fresh, clean, soft towels.  The breakfast was unbelievable.  Expensive but worth every penny.  The service could not be faulted.    We would stay here again and again!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Practically perfect in every way,
"somewhat typical 4S hotel but more ornate and ""less zen"" than their other properties I've been to (Istanbul, NY, London, Paris, Bev Hills).  The hotel has the magnificent florals as always but the overall feel is more busy that the other properties.  Rooms are nice and the service is,as one would expect, impeccable. Of particular note is that this hotel had one of the best concierge desks I've seen in a long time.  Not only willing to help and provide information but the two women i consulted with were very knowledgable about the airport, shopping ideas and restaurants.  More so than the average concierge at other 5 star properties.  I just didn't love the atmosphere as I do other 4S but it is truly a lovely hotel.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"top business hotel, what you expect of a Four Seasons",
"I am a member of the Marriott but due to a change in their awards program I search for another hotel.  Then I came across a special on the Four Seasons. It was actually the same price as the Marriott.  I had not stayed there for 5 years.  I was so surprised at the level of service at this hotel compared to others in Singapore.  It was like going to a different planet.  Even the JW Marriott in Hong Kong , which I love, did not match this amazing hotel.  Singapore is getting very expensive however it is worth the experience to pay alittle more for this fantastic hotel, also at a very good location.  On check out day they brought me a cup of tea right after the wake up call.  WOW",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful surprise awaits,
"I have had an opportunity to stay at Four Seasons in Singapore for several times and it has all the time exceeded the expectation.  The service was very attentive and the restaurant and room service was very good.   Whilst it is not a cheap option, it worth staying here if you can afford it.   I would say both Four Season and Ritz in Singapore are top notch hotel in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very nice and relaxing hotel,
"Having explored other hotels in town in the recent past & reviewed one or two - I am compelled to write a review about the Four Seasons Hotel where I stayed on many occasions 2007-2012. It's the impeccable service that distinguishes it from the other five stars in town . Although the building from the outside is nothing special (on my first stay, I was disappointed when approaching the hotel from the taxi) , the little things, the ""welcome back to us"" , the fantastic breakfast and great rooms (and incredible bathrooms equipped with L'Occitane products ... that make it a wonderful place to stay - a near boutique hotel feel ! Great location too !!!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,It still is my favourite in SIN,
"Upon my arrival, we found the hotel to be conveniently situated to the shopping palace - Ion Orchard Singapore's newest shopping center. However the hotel was a little hidden with its  entrance less grandeur than the other Four Seasons I had been to. e.g. HK 2IFC.   Nonetheless, the hotel staff were very attentive and the room was spacious. The bed was more superior and comfortable than most other hotels I have stayed at. We loved the opulent bathroom.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Luxury colonial style hotel,

"The Four Seasons is about ten years past due for a refresh. It's tired and there's nothing special about it compared with either its Four Seasons siblings or other hotels in the same bracket in Singapore.

"I have stayed for the 2 weeks at hotel during business trip. The hotel service, facilities and staff was good. I thought Four Seasons Singapore was more a business hotel.

"The hotel is located very close to the heart of Orchard Road. The rooms are good and spacious(especially the bathrooms), though my room view was boring (trees and tennis court). The complimentary wifi was very slow and getting disconnected and they prompt you to buy premium plan at $25/day if you complain. Room service was good and in general staff was okay, but this is due to fierce competition as I have noticed same level of service during my stay in singapore in other hotels.

"4 Seasons is my hotel of choice in Singapore.  Have stayed in about 20 hotels in Singapore, and this is my favorite.  The differentiating factor is probably the service.  The concierge, doormen (especially), front desk staff are all excellent.   I especially like the way they really do seem to to try to find ways to keep people happy.  My only slight niggle is the reception; there is no queuing system and on least one occasion I have had somebody cut in front of me.  The bar is very pleasant, and the restaurant also pretty good, especially for breakfasts which are excellent.  Location is obviously also very good if you want to be near Orchard Road.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Superb Service, nice bar, excellent breakfasts",

From checkin, with complimentary wait-time in the ""living room"" to the clerk's self guided tour of our room, nothing was left to ""pedestrian.""  This was our first stay and a Four Seasons, but I can honestly say, that if their property in Singapore was an indicator of the level of service they provide, we will choose-first The Four Seasons, wherever we travel.  Thank you to the staff for making our trip most-extraordinary!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Absolutely, Definitively, Amazingly, the best service we've received worldwide!",

Two pool choices (roof for families and 3rd floor for adults) are both very good, with attentive, but discreet, attendants.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Super location. Sublime bed comfort.,
"Booked this hotel for seven nights as it has two outdoor and two indoor tennis courts but I disputed the charges for using them as a paying guest. Outdoor courts charge was dropped (they suck anyway) and indoor court cost halved, still harsh though as there should be no charge at all. Afterall, hotel does not charge you to use the pools! That said, great indoor courts. Spa good, as are the staff. Friendly efficient service; nice spacious rooms; good level of house keeping and laundry. Afternoon Tea was good; bar lounge and staff are great. Superb dining and overall.....I will stay again during my next business trip.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Worth every penny.....almost,

"The Four Seasons has by far the best service I've ever experienced while staying in a hotel. We had a wedding in the main ballroom and stayed at the hotel two nights. The day of the actual reception, we needed a lot of assistance from the staff with printing documents, room service, and other last minute items we needed assistance with. No matter what time of day, the staff was available and always delivered.   Room service was great and the breakfast was absolutely amazing with many great choices. Can't go wrong if you choose to stay here.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Superb service with modern, clean rooms",
"The Four Seasons has been around for a long time and it may have a tired look on the outside. The rooms are in excellent shape for the price you have to pay. The rooms are larger than neighboring Hilton and Regent. But mostly, the service is top-notch. If you are looking for a stay in the Orchard Road area, but away from the madding crowd, you should consider Four Seasons for a truly 5-star experience. Very close to Ion shopping mall, the Orchard MRT...truly the heart of the shopping district.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,On the right side of Orchard Road for privacy and classy service,
"Have visited this property on 3 other occasions and have always been happy with the room size, amenities and service quality. This visit was also a pleasure, the rooms and lobby are showing a bit of age and the 20th floor pool was totally void of any 5 star service. The food was grossly overpriced and the quality of the menu in the 190 restaurant was disappointing as well was the food. I never saw more than 5 guests for any dinner service, making for a depressing eating environment. But overall I would return to the hotel , but would eat elsewhere in town.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great location but...,
"Travelling with a 5mth old is not normally easy, but the Four Seasons really went out their way all week to ensure the trip was smooth. The hotel itself is lovely, well sized rooms, fabulous dining and excellent amenities - but the service is what really makes the difference here. Nothing was too much trouble, they were proactive about what is needed in a room with a baby, and all staff were greeting each of us by name by Day 2.  We will definitely be back !",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Outstanding service on Orchard Blvd,
"I was two days in the Four Seasons Sigapore for a small conference my company promoted. The infraestructure provided by the hotel was great, the staff always friendly and helpful. The hotel has a small pool on the roof top that used one time for relaxing. Very close to a very good comercial area and the best mall in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very Good,
"Stayed one night for a business trip. Was upgraded to a honeymoon room as the hotel was full! Lovely room, very luxurious. There was also treats like macaroons and brownies on a small table next the lift - nice touch from the hotel.  Very good service from staff, address you by name and always with a smile. The location is nice if you are planning to spend time on Orchard road for shopping.  Really enjoyed breakfast, good spread and delicious food. Had cocktails at the bar in the evening which were also good but pricey( standard for the four seasons).   Overall great hotel but pricey even for singapore. Stay here if you want to be treated like an honoured guest.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Lovely hotel with amazing service but on the expensive side,
"Stayed here for a few nights in November 2011.  Got a suite with a nice view of Orchard Road.  The hotel is on a quit street just off of Orchard Road, so it is quiet but still just a couple of minutes walk to all the shops and restaurants.  The location is nice, but I personally prefer to be closer to Marina Bay as it is more lively in that part of town.  We had a great Thanksgiving dinner in the restaurant with an interesting take of the traditional turkey and fixings.  Overall, certainly not the nicest Four Seasons... but still a Four Seasons.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Very nice, but it is the Four Seasons obviously",
"What do you expect from a Four Seasons? It was a short stay but luxurious.  The check-in experience was very brief but professional. This is exactly how it should be. No qualms.   The room was very nicely done. Extremely clean and comfortable. A bit on the small side if there was 2 people in the room. However, for a solo traveler, it is perfect.  Room Service arrived quickly and the food was great. Do try the cream fettucine!   Parking was complimentary which is great especially with Singapore's exorbitant charge rate.  Overall, a perfect hotel in the heart of Orchard.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Luxury. Nothing less from Four Seasons,
Fist two stays at four seasons were flawless. The third was poor. For the first two stays management presence was obvious and the service was exactly what would be expected of a hotel in the group. The last stay there was no obvious management presence and it was obvious. Desk staff fiddling with mobile phones rather than deal with customers etc etc... I am very disappointed. Room was much smaller than any I had previously stayed in at this hotel too... and you could hear the elevator noise.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Disappointed with my last stay,
"Everything about this hotel was outstanding.  My sisters and I shared a suite, which was truly beautiful.  The staff were exceptional and couldn't do enought to help the traveller.  The main restaurant was excellent for a hotel.  The porters were exceptional.  Just having arrived, they knew my name.  Would recommend to anyone",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The Four seasons hotel singapore,
"Love Four Seasons Hotels....however, we were all very disappointed in the service - did not think it was up to their normal.  Hotel is in a great location - nice rooms - quiet but hotel itself is a little 'outdated'.   We left our room for the day - not back until after 4p.m. and our room had not been cleaned - very surprising for a Four Seasons.  We did, however, leave some items in our safe - called the hotel and they found same for us and packaged and returned items to US - that I have to give them high marks for but.....when we were at the hotel - just did not find the service/personnel anywhere near the level we found in other 5 star hotels in Asia - sorry!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Disappointed in Hotel......,
"Our 6day vacation was awesome! It's our 3rd country in one month, meaning our 3rd hotel too. I loved everything about four seasons in singapore. Let's start with the location, very near Ion mall-it's the newest and most complete mall on orchard rd now, from high end to mid, casual to formal with loads of restos and foodcourts..just literally a few steps away. The room is very well kept, maintained and smelled really good. From the service, breakfast,  sheets, pillows, carpet and plush slippers, and most importantly the bathroom was perfect. Separate toilet and shower, had loccitane toiletries, for a choosy and sensitive hotel person... i can say, it was a wonderful stay!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful Stay!,

"Well-located, close to the shops and MRT on Orchard Road, The Four Seasons is a typical five-star hotel: large, comfortable rooms with good wi-fi and the sort of first-class service you expect.  The breakfast buffet has a good selection of foods, the lobby bar is decent and the Windows function rooms command a great view over the city and provide the perfect setting for small gatherings.Staff are friendly and efficient, though on check-out they did try to bill me for breakfast for six people! Overall a very good hotel.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Singapore in Style,
"Stayed there for a conference. Rooms & service are great as usual. Loccitaine bathroom amenities are a nice touch. I like the arrangement where you can stream movies from iPhone/iPad to the TV. Only downside is no-complimentary internet/wi-fi access and breakfast no included despite a S$500/nite price tag. They should have at least these 2 items which are standard features even in 3 star hotel, but having to pay S$30 for 24hour internet access is crazy.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Very good, could be great",
"A beautiful hotel, wonderful rooms, perfect size with great service. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. Quick to respond.  We stayed in a one bedroom suite which was beautifully appointed.

"I stayed here for 2 nights while on business in Singapore. Its located in a very quiet location, slightly off Orchard road, but not exactly close to Marina bay or the business district. Service is excellent and personalised. Rooms were quite large and beautiful, everything was perfectly in place for a business hotel, This one was more traditional as compared to Four seasons Hongkong.  The hotel is superb in all respects but I have stayed at other Singapore business hotels which I would personally rank better than Four seasons Singapore - St. Regis Singapore and the Fullerton Bay.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Business Hotel - good service.,
"The Four Seasons Singapore lived up to my expectations and more! An absolutely top notch hotel by all standards. From the moment the car picked me up at the airport, to the complimentary breakfast waiting for me in my room, to the fresh fruit set out each day, to the personalized service at every turn, the Four Seasons had me at ""Hello"". I will absolutely be returning on my next visit and will be looking to stay at FS other locations in the future. I am hooked!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,THE go to place in Singapore!!,

The service, food, and location of the Four Seasons Singapore makes it an easy choice.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This Hotel Has to be my favorite for Singapore,

"Once again loved our stay at the Four Seasons, it is the little finishing touches that puts it above alot of top quality hotels.  From when we arrived to when we left nothing was too much trouble, the staff from the door to the dining room were lovely, always a smile and hello. The breakfast had everything for all nationalities, japanese, chinese and of course a good old english, eggs done whatever way you choose, I loved the pastries as well especially the fruit and nut fresh loaf which was delicious!!! The room was lovely with fresh fluffy towels, fresh sheets, with a good view of the city line. I would recommend this hotel just for the lovely finishing touches that you get, Hats off Four Seasons.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Didn't Disappoint,
"I love this hotel, largely because it is not too big, has excellent service and is in a great location. I stay here twice a year, and still recommend it. The only caveat is it does seem to have slipped a little. My room was not as perfectly clean as expected (very minor things but one expects perfection at the Four Seasons), and breakfast was a little chaotic whereas it used to be seamless. However, it still is amazing service overall, and has a great buffet breakfast (expensive so try to get it included in the rate). The room decor is pretty but neither feminine or masculine - has a good balance. Service still remains top notch.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent,
"I stayed in Hotel Four Seasons, Singapore for about a week. It is an excellent place to stay for business travelers as well as tourists. It is located on Orchard Boulevard in Singapore, which is a nice and quiet road to experience a gentle side of Singapore through a casual walk. But those looking for Malls and Movies need not be disappointed - for they are located very close to the Hotel, on the other side, in Orchard Area. The Hotel itself has very good, spacious rooms with good quality furnishing. Services are of high order with smiling and courteous staff. It is not exactly cheap- but good value for money.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel for Business Travelers and Tourists alike,
"Nothing bad to say about this hotel. The furniture soo beautiful, clean, and love the bathroom. Its can fit for 2 persons, and of course the ammenities is from loccitane.

Fantastic hotel & had little touchs for couples like they will not contact you until after miday so you can sleep in & relax. Biggest disappointment was the pools that are very dated & look NOTHING like what there website shows.

"The Four Seasons Singapore is an older hotel.  The upkeep of this hotel was good and our room was very comfortable and clean.  Renovation/Upgrade was done to the room to provide some modern bells and whistles.  The perk of being built longer than other hotels is that it has one of the best locations in the city.  The Four Seasons Singapore is right on Orchard Road and it is connected to a shopping plaza underground.    However, our minor complaint is that the window of our room was dirty outside, with the high humidity of Singapore; it was hard to see anything from inside the room.   They should really clean their windows more often, after all, they are Four Seasons, and that is what their customers expect from them.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect location for first-time Singapore visitors,
"Stayed here for three nights at the end of our wonderful Singapore stay. The hotel is outstanding and the service is even better. Our daughter (4 yrs) was treated like a princess:) Good location, close to the shops but still in a quiet spot.   The room was large enough and had a great bathroom with all amenities one could hope for. The hotel has two pools, we used the roof top pool and our 4 yrs old loved the toys they had. Very quiet and nice to spend time around the pool.   Loved everything about this hotel, would love to stay here again!!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Wow, a true 5 star experience!",
"I stayed here about seven years ago, and it looks like they haven't spent much money on upgrading the hotel since then. The room was reasonably sized but is quite dated now and doesn't feel special. The cafe/ restaurant is a bit bland. Likewise the 'club' space is very gloomy and has poor facilities. The only saving grace for the stay was the gym, which has a lot of up to date Life Cycle machines and a good range of free weights.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Needs upgrading,
"By first appearance the hotel is not visually amazing, the lobby is dull and the facilities a bit cold. Terribly overpriced for what is offered, compared to its competitors St. Regis and Marina Bay, Four Seasons needs a facelift to stay competitive. The Chinese restaurant was not as good as 1 year ago when I visited, and the all day restaurant is lacking an identity.. The location is top notch which is why I chose this hotel again its steps from Orchard, and the 20th floor pool has a great view, just needs to be refurbished a bit..   Dont bother with the concierge they have a bit of an attitude, they had difficulty just changing my air ticket to another date!",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pricey and Average,
"Very nice hotel with super nice and clean rooms, but there is a strong odor in the lobby. Maybe it's the perfume they use. This is a top rate hotel, and I have no complaints expect for the price of the internet, and that this is located a block and a half away from Orchard Rd, which I suppose it's that big of a deal.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Nice hotel, but expensive",
"Disappointing food and service at the 190 restaurant, not up to FS standard compared to other hotels in Singapore also the food is lacking. Service was good although concierge was a bit rude, seemed agitated to give advice. Need to seriously change there website pic for pool looks nothing like the real thing!! ",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Been Better....,
"We stayed there for 3 days for visiting. We arrived late and were tired so not ok for complaining but one of our room had a strong smell (like if an animal had stayed there!).  Breakfast is not good and it is in a dark place.  Concierge was not good, we had the feeling we were annoying her with too many questions. We did ask for a nice peking duck restaurant and it came out to be a bad advice she gave us while after we realized they have a good chinese restaurant in the Hotel.  We wanted to rest around the pool after a full day of walking in the city but we decided not to, the pool is ugly! Absolutely not like on their website! We will not come back to this hotel if back in Singapore.",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not up to the standard of a Four Seasons!,
"Expensive hotel but well worth it.  Extremely courteous and helpful staff. High quality furnishings and fittings, excellent bed. Clean room, good bathroom products - housekeeping very good.  Jiang-Nan Chun restaurant - very good food.  One-Ninety restaurant also good.   Children's swimming pool on 20th floor, separate from pool in fitness and spa section on 3rd floor. (Not only ideal for lone adults who want to swim for fitness, but also a relief for stressed parents!) Only aspect that we would fault was that the breakfast buffet was charged at adult rate for children, and was cleared away early.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent leisure or business hotel,
"Love this hotel. Service is best, always remember my name.  Room is beautifully appointed and bed very comfortable.  If there is a negative, room I stayed inn had a motion detector that made a no ice when you moved.   I would rate the restaurant as a solid good.  That is not why I stay here though.

"I stayed at Four Seasons for more than a week, on a business trip. Perfectly located for shopping and dining - just across Orchard Road. Mine was a spacious room with a king size bed, and with an extra large bathroom. The room over looked the Orchard Road area. Buffet breakfast has good variety and quality. The room has internet and a good range of TV channels. The swimming pool is pretty small and was a disappointment. Did not use the spa or gym, but had a walk through them and they looked very clean and well maintained.  Besides that, check-in and check-out were very quick and hassel free.  Since Four Seasons does not have a Membership Program, it might not be an attractive option for frequent travellers. Service and quality were exceptional though.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good Service and pleasant stay,
My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons 15th to 24th June 2011. Perfect surroundings attentive polite helpful staff. Very very professional clean rooms excellent pool gym sauna and so forth. To make this hotel perfect sort out the wireless connection prices there really is no excuse this day and age to charge $35 a day for connection. I fully understand that this is a 5 star hotel but even so this is far to much. But all in all very good the best stay ever in singapore!!!,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel attentive staff,
"When we arrived, I dont know what the staffs were doing but I ended up taking the suitcases out of the cab myself. Never happened to me in any other 5star hotels.  Other than that we loved the hotel, the lobby had scents and it smelled great all the time. We did not spend enough time at the hotel, but I remember that their service was fast, for instance when I had called housekeeping for something, it immediately arrived. The bathroom was big! The standard room was very spacious!  The best part of the hotel was the bed and pillows, the best from any hotels I have ever stayed in!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best bed! Huge room.,

"Staying in Four Seasons is always fabulous. The greeting from the Porters and Doorman shows a very warm welcome. The Receptionist is friendly, courteous. The bedroom is very elegantly furnished and yet relaxing. The bathroom is spacious, too, with luxurious toilettries. Porter always delivers the luggage in timely manner. The breakfast is a great thing to start the day; sumptuous food, a real gourmet delight for the morning. The turndown service is very nice, too; the chambermaid always prepares a bucket of ice ready to the guest to make some cocktails. The hotel's green attitude is also well applied; offers the guests the option whether or not the linen and towel changing is desired.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent stay. A true home far away from home.,

"We stayed 6 nights in April and every single person made our stay here special.  This was my second time here - the last one was in 2008. Alex Porteus the Hotel Manager is one of the friendliest and most professional person we have come across in the hotel industry.  You can tell how good a hotel is with the way they deal with problems.  We had a slight hiccup when the staff entered the room despite being told we did not want anyone coming during our stay, but this problem was dealt with promptly and professionally.  Good location, high quality fixtures and fittings but the thing that sets this hotel apart is the superlative service.  We stayed in a superior room with separate shower.  Breakfast is good but not quite as good as 3 years ago. Fitness room and 2 pools are good too.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Superlative service - a true reflection of the Four Seasons brand,
"Four Seasons is a famous brand for luxury around the world.  But this hotel did not meet my expectation given the price.  The electronic hookup didn't work, the in room safe failed twice, and a dvd they lent me didn't work on the player in the room.  Combined with no program to credit airline miles, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  Oh, and two female staff members walking into the men's locker room while I was there.  Good thing I'm not shy!",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not up to expectations,
"I was reminded upon check-in that it has been awhile since I stayed with them. I was told that I would be led to my room but as the receptionist was slow, I went myself. The Premier room had the same look and feel as the past: large, classical, cosy, relaxing. Some items looked a bit dated - but no real complaints. Had breakfast and brunch at the Three SIxty Resturant. Excellent offerings and excellent quality. Service staff not 100% knowledgeable about the food.

I arranged a vehicle transfer from the airport through the hotel, and was fairly overwhelmed when, on arrival, we were whisked straight to the room, by-passing reception, and with the (minimal) check in formalities doen in the room.  WE felt like real VIPS (which we are not)..  Hotel standards, comfort and friendliness right up to 4 Seasons expectations, and its a block and a half walk to Orchard Road.  Obviously, there is a cost, but I got a 3 nights for the proce of 2 deal, which they make available quite often on the web site, and that made it really good value.  Can't fault..",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Impeccible,
The hotel offered more than 5 star services. There were variety of food stuffs offered in the restaurant. The chefs were accmmodative enough to cook the desired meal.

Overall it was enjoyable and EXCELLENT.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent value for money when in Singapore,
"Exactly what you would expect from a Four Seasons - great service and a modern clean hotel. On arrival, we were exhausted after a long flight with our baby daughter. They gave her a bee toy with integrated book which she loved. Checkin took place in the room and a cot was delivered swiftly so we could have a family nap. The rest of the stay was similar - nothing was any trouble and the staff were both helpful and friendly. We would stay there again.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, friendly staff",
"Four Seasons Hotels vary from country to country.  This one is located just off Orchard Road and close to major shopping.  Rooms were very clean.  Bathrooms in true Four Seasons were clad in white Marble.  My only comment is that the hotel was promoting the use of some of their facilities to non guests? A Sign of the times?  As a side note, I booked the two nights on expedia which is the way I often do.  This time the rates changed while I was online causing me to have to pay one price for one night and a higher price fof the next.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Close but not all 5's,

Feel very cosy except for bed, which I think personally a bit hard. Having said that, I still had a good sleep :-).  Area: Walking distance to Orchard road. It is on the other side of the Orchard.

The hotel was just great, as soon as we walked in, check in was in the room, the rolloway was already laid out, the bags arrived just behind us.  The hotel is really well situated just near all the shopping on orchard road.  Breakfast was really sumptuous the gym, absolutely spotless and really well equipped, sadly we only stayed one night.  The food in the restaurant was very good and our daughter wanted chinese which they duly brought down from their chinese restaurant without even a second thought.  An excellent stay, will definately come back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,what a lovely smart hotel,
"Tis hotel is really nice. te interior is beautiful and also the stuff is very helpfull. But why is the 4 seasons so overcarged? I stayed in many hotels but they drive cazy in singapore. The rooms are very very small for that price and you do not have any speciall thing you get extra, like breakfast orwhatever. If you wanna book somebody a hotel to save your immage book the 4 seasons but not for your self. Unless somebody is paying for you.

"We stayed here  for five days in November.  The rooms, service and general ambience was excellent.  We had a deluxe room and the most comfortable bed we have had on our  travels.  The hotel is  not a cheap option but if you make up your mind to go for this price bracket you will not be disappointed.  A small point - the  General Manager sought us out for a conversation on two occasons in the  five  days.  He clearly has his finger on the pulse.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,An excellent choice for central Singapore.,

"Room quite comfortable.  The location is good as well and the bed is quite comfortable. Big standarad Four Seasons bathroom, no complaints. However, carpet and decor a bit aged and minor renovations really needed.  I did not feel that the staff are particularly helpful.  Doormen did not offer to help with luggage and check-in was slow.

Four Seasons - Beautiful service, excellent location, clean smoke-free rooms and beds you can die for.  All this for a much much better price than MBS, and a much much better value for money.  The morale of the story? Don't bother staying at Marina Bay Sands.  Stay Four Seasons, or any of the other real 5 star hotels in Singapore.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons - Can always count on it as a nice place to stay,
"Stayed for 3 days in November.    While the hotel is nice enough, it is definitely in the lower quartile of the Four Seasons properties we have stayed in.  Nothing was terribly wrong, but nothing was done that well either.    We arrived late in the evening and it must have taken the desk clerk 30 minutes to check us in (new employee?).    The rooms were ok, but tired -- a little beat up and need of updating.   Each day it took till late afternoon  for our room to be made up and turn down service was hit or miss.  On the positive side, the internet was free (a rarity in Four Seasons) and the room service was quick and tasty.  Seemed like this Four Seasons missed a bunch of easy lay ups that most Four Seasons properties have down cold.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Not as Nice as Other Four Seasons Properties,

"After our stay in KL and Samui, we stayed 2 nights in Singapore. Singapore is expensive and so are the hotels, but since we had to be here, we decided to make the best of it and staying in a real 5 star hotel, which was going to be the Four Seasons. It was a very pleasant stay. The room we stayed in was big and elegant. The bathroom size knocks you out!  As to be expected, the service from the staff is excellent. Very helpful, polite, perfect knowledge of English, just like you can expect from a 5 star hotel in a city/country like Singapore.

"The hotel is fantastic -- great facilities and a phenomenal breakfast buffet spread.  The rooms were very nice, especially the spacious bathroom.  The staff has the typical Four Seasons service with a smile, but my experience at the two Asian Four Seasons was that the hotels nickel and dimed you over small fees and charges (kind of annoying when you are paying a premium to stay there already).  If I had to do it over again I might have stayed closer to downtown where there are more things to do other than shopping.

Pool wasn't the most interesting, but I guess you don't come to lay by the pool!   Gym was great too.  We didn't eat at the Hotel, chose to go off and explore.   I highly recommend staying here to anyone..",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Loved it!,
"We stayed three days at Four Seasons in Singapore. It was a very pleasant stay. The room was big and elegantly decorated. Size of the bathroom was particularly impressive. The staff was unusually helpful and polite, they went out of their way to assisst us in everything we requested. The hotel is not located around the bay area but this is compensated by the proximity to Orchard Road, a shopping parapise. Probably one of the best hotels in town (still behind Mandarin Oriental).",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,very pleasant hotel,
"Quite simply, there are nothing but positives to say about this property.   Every request was handled with unbelieveable efficiency and professionalism.  Nice location off the beaten path of Orchard Rd. but within easy walking distance via a nice park-lined street.  The food, internet speed (the hotel said they recently upgraded to a 100Mbps connection and it shows in the fast speeds I obtained), security, and room amenities are unbeatable.  Concierge, reception, room service, etc. perfect.    This is my new home base in Singapore with I need luxury, 5-star+ accomodations.  Rather expensive, yes.  But, so is most everything in Singapore - the difference is here that you get what you pay for and a lot more.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons Singapore Will Not Disappoint,
"Though I stay at Four Seasons often, I almost didn't stay there in Singapore because of some of the reviews on TripAdvisor.  After staying there for two nights in August and nine nights in September, I would absolutely recommend the Four Seasons Singapore.  I stayed into two different level rooms and both were wonderfully furnished with super comfortable beds and bedding.  The location is great because it is just behind the Hilton off Orchard.  You get the benefit of being near Orchard without the noise.  Most of all, the staff provided exceptional, friendly service.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Fantastic Hotel with exceptional Four Seasons service and rooms,
"I am currently staying at the Four Seasons, Singapore. Without exception, my experience thus far has been outstanding. The service is impeccable, the room beautiful and the location ideal. To give you an idea of how excellent the service is...I am an allergy sufferer. I have a severe allergy to nuts. Since I have arrived, the hotel staff have gone out of their way to ensure I am safe and not exposed to any food with nuts. So much so...tonight when i ordered room service, i had a visit from the Sous chef to check my meal was okay. And, of course, it was delicious. I can not recommend this hotel to you enough. It is by far the best in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Outstanding!,

"Room was marvelous! large with TV screen connecting to i-pod/ laptop. Equipped with DVD player. Welcome drink provided in room after entering into the room. Decor was modern but elegant. Still using the old style door key, which was an unique but traditional experience. The bed made me refuse to wake up...softy and fluffy! Location was not very convenient, as need to pass through Hilton hotel to subway station. Service was great. Reception desk staff was very polite and attentive. Doorman was very helpful. Would recommend to friends in future.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,excellent stay,
"Though it is frightfully expensive, this hotel serves as a perfect place to enjoy a romantic getaway in a bustling city.  Four Seasons offers the best service that any hotel can and has the best restaurants and rooms that you can see in the hotel industry.  This particular hotel has a fabulous location and they think through all the needs of a customer and plan ahead.  If you want to relax, enjoy and rock in Singapore then this is the Hotel to stay in.  It is walking distance from Orchard Street and they arrange for their car to drop you to Clarkey.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,If you want total luxury at your fingertips then this is the place,
The room service food was uninspiring although the Jiang-Nan Chun restaurant was excellent The staff were generally very good and friendly. Strangely (in my opinion) after a two week stay (ie: expensive) they wanted to charge me for an hour or two's internet access after I'd checked out but was waiting to be taken to the airport - I thought that was poor form.,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Vaguely disappointing,
"Gorgeous hotel.  Arrived in the middle of the night .  They new all our preferences and had a complete twin bed set up for my son- not a rollaway.  Beautiful British accents.  Beautiful andf large room and bathroom. Allowed 4pm checkout and had great spa area to come back and shower and change for 10 pm flight.  Nice gym and pool.  we were the only ones using it.  Food extremely expensive..  There are many choices right outside the door including the food opera in the mall.  This modern hawker stands with great food right in an adjacent upscale mall.. If you want ot shop there is every designer and store you can think of within a few blocks.  MRT station on corner as well. Near botanical gardens, but otherwise a little removed from central area.  We really enjoyed our stay.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Usual excellent Four Seasons hospitality,
"We had a great 3 night stay at the Four Seasons Singapore.  The hotel is elegant, comfortable, modern and exudes stately luxury all without being stuffy.  We loved the location - close to Orchard Rd (enter via Hilton) yet not right on the main road itself.  Staff were excellent...helpful and knowledgable and always so friendly.  We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment but prices did look very high.  There were 3 of us sharing so we opted for a 1 bdrm suite which was well worth it - gave us enough room to spread out and be comfortable.  Would not hesitate in staying here again when in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Class & Luxury In Great Location,
We travelled with extended family from 10 month old baby to seniores and  arrived very late flying in from Beijing.   The service at all times was faultless. Food great.  Rooms spotless and comfortable.  The concierge arranged a guided tour for us around Singapore.   The laundry service was excellent.   The pool and tennis facilities were brilliant.   Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  If you have the time visit the zoo and botanical gardens.   Once in a lifetime experience.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect!  Nothing too much trouble.,
"We spent two nights in Singapore before our cruise.  We chose the Four Seasons because we got a good deal for the quality of the hotel.  We were not disappointed.  The rooms were very spacious, and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!  What I like about the Four Seasons is its understated elegance.  The breakfast was fabulous.  Thankfully, it was included in our room rate because it was very expensive.  Service is top-notch.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Everything was perfect!,
"Our third stay at the recently refurbished Four Seasons in Singapore did not disappoint - perfect service, lovely room. This hotel really gives you a cuddle when you walk through the door and then wraps itself around you. Wonderful, what more can I say.  Make sure you book Breakfast in your package - I forgot and it can prove an expensive extra although there are loads of perfectly good places to get breakfast nearby",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The very best hotel in Singapore,

"I stayed at Four Seasons in Aug 09 as part of a business conference and was really pleasantly suprised. I am not a 5-star hotel traveller by choice as i feel they are in general a bit cold and dont really help you experience the city, but this one was different. It has some really nice views of Orchard Street -felt like you were in the thick of things just looking out from the room.   The front desk and staff were excellent , and managed our conference very well. Most surprising , was that the food was spectacular. they kept sending some lovely Chinese nibbles every hour which would just disappear in no time!  Nice rooms, very appropriate for business travel but I especially love the one indulgence-grand bathrooms with the queen sized tub!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great business hotel, wonderful food",
"We stayed at The Four Seasons Singapore hotel for 3 nights with our 17 year old son. After an efficient check-in at 7am, we were escorted to our suite. We had been upgraded from a one-bedroomed suite to a magnificent themed suite with its own Christmas tree , kitchen and enormous dining room! The service throughout our stay was perfect - to say the least. Other hotels could only strive to meet the standards of this amazing hotel. Well done to all the staff! We will be back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,You cannot get better !,
I stayed with my wife and 3 year old son and this was a great hotel. My wife and son arrived one day earlier than me and they were picked up by a nice driver in a Mercedes and were greated by name when they arrived at the hotel. We were booked in an executive suite but got upgraded to the larger one bedroom suite which was really nice and spacious. Overall we couldn't fault this hotel and all our requests were dealt with promptly and efficiently. We certainly did not feel that the hotel was dated at all and we thought that the hotel compared well with other four seasons properties or other top quality hotels. When I go for business I like to stay at the Fullerton due to its location but when I return to Singapore with my family I will almost certainly stay at the Four Seasons.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very good!,
"It is the Four Seasons, so there's an expectation that comes with the pricetag.  Definitely a nice hotel, beautiful rooms, huge comfy beds, big bathrooms, 42 inch flat screens and L'occitane amenities. And the service was decent (though not truly spectacular as at other Four Seasons I've stayed at.  The biggest issue I have is the wireless internet not being free.  The amount you pay for a room here, there is no reason you should have to pay an extra $65 for internet.  That's just robbery.  Too bad, because everything else is pretty much top notch.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"IT IS THE FOUR SEASONS, BUT...",
"-Stayed at the FS (not to be confused with The Regent) for 2 nights back in Oct  Pros - Great service from concierge, bell hop to check-in - Special request (like food not on the menu) were honored at the lobby lounge even thought it was late at night - Beds comfortable  Cons - In-room internet both expensive and EXTREMELY slow.. not an understatement. I tried both wired and wireless and it is painfully slow. It takes like 2 minutes to load a page - so this is very frustrating - Hotel decor very plain - more towards bland than classical -  just none of the ""wow"" factor or cool factor - just plain old boring, even if comfortable",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Nice but dated,
We have now stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore on at least 3 occasions. It never disappoints!  The service is 5 star - in particular concierge for whom nothing is too much trouble.  We will only stay at the Four Seasons in Singapore and highly recommend it to all!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,The best hotel we have stayed in!,
"Our adjoining suites on the 18th Floor  provided us with comfort and amenities that we were looking for. The decor of the rooms is old but not dated; where old money meets techno savvy; classy but not over bearing, modern but discreet. The pool, gym,and sauna areas are well serviced and maintained. Staff assistance is attentive and thorough. We wouldn't recommend this hotel just for its great location; an oasis of calm in a main strip of shopping chaos; but also for the its thoughtful, relaxing beauty.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Beautiful hotel in the most convenient location,
This is an expensive hotel. They have more personalised service (i.e. the people try to call you by your name). The have a traditional look. The location of the hotel is not good for tourist. It is fine for Business people.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Loved the Ambiance,
"We stayed here for 2 nights on our way to Japan. After reading previous reviews I was very worried and almost cancelled our booking. I am so glad I didn't. The room was lovely and spacious and grand. I have stayed at the Penninsula in Bangkok- my no 1 hotel of all the places I have stayed and this was great standard. They allowed us to check in at 7 am when we arrived to sleep with no extra charge. The bathrooms were huge and bed so comfortable. Location great, we could walk everywhere.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Wonderful,
"haven't been back to the 4 seasons Singapore for years but still the best hotel in town, not necessarily the most interesting hotel (from a design perspective) but the most comfortable hotel and the best service  it's the little things: i.e. being walked to your room by the same person that checks you in, coffee being delivered 5 am along with the wake up call, I didn't do this to them but my friend ordered food from another hotel (Mandarin Oriental apparently best known for their hainanese chicken rice) and they ordered it for her, picked it up and only charged her for the food+ taxi fare  if on company expense (as I was last week) I'd definitely stay here again",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,best service best hotel (if on company expense),
This is a great property.  The rooms are lovely and the service and location are exceptional.  Singapore is not known for delivering on good service but this hotel is an exception.  I felt that hotel staff were not only responsive but predicted by needs.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Exceptional property,
"There was not one single problem with this hotel.  Perfect airport pick-up, in-room check-in on arrival, excellent modern-amenities room, luxe bath, excellent restaurant.  And close enough to Orchard Road without being right in the chaos.  (Exit throught the attached mall by Cafe 190 into the connected Hilton Hotel to access Orchard Road.)  Taxi service always immediate, business center excellent, concierge available and well-informed.  They've got it all going on.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect from beginning to end,
"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, first stop on our honeymoon.  The hotel itself is well decorated, clean and the service was exceptional.  The room itself was exactly as you'd expect from a Four Seasons.  The concierge couldn't help enough, even when my wife drove them mad.  All the staff were constantly friendly and nothing was ever to much for them.  the front door staff know your name from the moment you arrive, and refuse to let you open the door for yourself. The breakfast in the hotel was brilliant, with more on offer than you could ever eat. All in all this hotel was a great start to our honeymoon, and i would definately return.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, as expected!!!",
"My friend and I stayed in a Deluxe room for three days in June, and I must say I was extremely impressed with FS Singapore!  We arrived the hotel 1am in the morning as our flight was delayed, and upon check in the agent was alreaday expecting us--seamless checkin and the porters were extremely friendly as well. Rooms were fairly large and a very nice bathroom with separate shower. Buffet breakfast( included in our package) was  nice, but one would get bored easily as the selection was the same every day. This FS is relatively small compared to the one in HK but I felt it is more cozy and really genuine warmth from the staff. If you don't mind walking for a bit Orchard road is just 5 minutes away from the hotel. Will definitely come back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent stay,
"This hotel is old! Much of the room furnishings are old and a little tired. However, the staff and the maintenance of the hotel make up for the old and dated furnishings. Very friendly staff, excellent breakfast buffet, good facilities (with 'private' lap pool on lower floor and sun tanning pool on roof top), well maintained.  Would recommend this hotel in a city that is not short for choices. The bonus is that it isn't a very large property and therefore doesn't have those large crowds. Plus, it is off Orchard Road, on a slight incline, away from the bustle of the street.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Good dated hotel,
"When you hear the name Four Seasons, you expect a superb 5-star hotel. Four Seasons Singapore does not offer a big range of in-house dining. You need to leave the hotel to look for a varirty of restaurants. In general the Hotel is relatively small in size. ",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Can be better,
"I've stayed at the FS for three days; business and leisure. The staff and service was absolutely excellent. Had a minor problem with the in-room safe in the beginning, but it was fixed wthin 10 minutes.  I had a corner room with a very big bathroom and everything was in perfect order.  Used the two pools on the roof and in the ""Club"", where you also can take a shower after you have already checked out. Nice service!  The location off Orchard Road is good, too. It is much more quiet than on the ""big"" road and so easy to access via the indoor link with the Hilton Hotel. You can find the link right between the bar and the restaurant.  Overall, a great stay and I can absolutely recommend to choose this hotel while being in Singapore. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel - Great Service,
"Up to the normal standards you would expect from the excellent four seasons chain.  Huge room, clean and well furnished.  Helpful staff and very efficient.  Wide choice at breakfast although service can be a little slow.   It feels very much like a business hotel though - but great for a short stay passing through. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great for a short stay,
"There are certain aspects about hotels that turn them from good to great. The Four Seasons is a great hotel, we are frequent visitors to Singapore and would not think about staying anywhere else. The welcome and check in are friendly and straightforward. The rooms, classically decorated are soooo comfortable. The breakfasts are amazing. What more can I say-fabulous. Looking forward to our next visit in November ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Our favourite hotel - the Four Season,
"Great rooms, location and staff, was not impressed with the breakfast. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Shame about the breakfast,
"Stayed for a weeks holiday in a superior room in late June. Hotel room and service very, very good. Staff could not do enough to help. My wife needed to see a doctor while she was here (not serious and nothing to do with the hotel) and the staff did everything but carry her there themselves - lots of chocolates and fruit for several days afterwards plus staff check-ups. Pool and Club areas excellent with helpful and attentive staff. I would rate it excellent but for one ""gripe"" - the restaurants are a rip-off. Not a major problem though as there are numerous restaurants within a few minutes walk where you can get better food at half the price. Moral of the story is ""get out and sample the town"" and dont just be a hotel person. Overall - highly recommended. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Recommended,
"Based on my experiences staying at five different Four Season's previously, the Singapore hotel falls a bit short. It is still a grand and excellently run hotel. However, the Premium room that I got was not up to other Four Season's standards and the view out the corner windows was quiite ugly at both views. I may be a bit picky, but as highly rated and as relatively expensive this hotel is, it should be perfect as, I found, was the case at the Four Season's in New York and Paris for instance. The policy of all Four Seasopn's of charging between $10 and $20 extra for high speed internet access is downright foolish on their part. Instead of charging $600 or $800. for a room, charge $610 or $810 and forgo the embarrassing surcharge for what should surely be part of the room rate. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent but.......,
"Stayed at the Four Seasons end of May in an executive suite. It was an amazing experience. Staff knew you by name and service was friendly. However, I think the  Mariott and Hyatt were closer to shops. To be fair, the Four Seasons was close to shops as well but you have to walk through a walkway to get to the shops and if you go late at night, the walkway was a little deserted.  Food was great - had the curry laksa and room service was fantastic. The rooms were also spacious, very new and had lovely tolietries. I liked the little touches that the Four Seasons had like being able to check in in your room and not queue up at reception which made the stay memorable. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great stay,
"I rarely enthuse about a hotel but this one breaks the mould. Not so much for its rooms and facilities, they are fine enough but replicated as well elsewhere. No, what makes this one different is the quality of service. The staff are the best trained and motivated I have ever encountered, I think. So few chains understand the need for this to ensure repeat business. Service is personalised, discreet and anticipatory. From the wakeup call to the concierge, the transition is flawless. The emphasis on safety is also very welcome. My only niggles are the constant fiddling with the room key, especially for the lift - time they went wireless - and the room safe is too small for a laptop. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,As good as it gets,
"I like this hotel, and am inclined to agree that the rooms and the decor are indeed the best I've seen in Singapore (although I haven't stayed at Raffles - slightly different price range!)  But there are a number of minor issues that could be addressed:  - Complimentary bottled water is standard in most 5 star hotels in Singapore, but not the 4 Seasons. - Complimentary toothbrushes are also fairly standard in Singapore, but not at the 4 Seasons. - Some daily chocolates are a nice gesture, absent in the 4 Seasons...  It's a good hotel, I'd stay there again, but I prefer Raffles The Plaza (which also is more convenient for the business traveller) ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Very good, but room for improvement",
"Not my typical Four Seasons experience, the hotel was very busy when I stayed with them for 3 nights and the lobby was a complete chaotic mess when I checked in. There were more people hanging around the lobby than at the MRT station. I had the unpleasuring experience of dealing with Ms. Fairoza at the desk who tended to my check in inquiry regarding a non- smoking room and I can honestly tell you she may have been the rudest employee I have come across at any FS. 'No sir we dont have it, are you going to stay with us'.     I ordered breakfast through room service and received the wrong eggs, when I asked to have them replaced it took an additional 35 minutes.   All in all a nice hotel just small details.  Cheers ",2.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Rough Stay,
"Stayed here 2 nights and it was a pleasant stay. The service was generally excellent. The concierges provided some good nontouristy restaurant recomendations and helped us plan a day of sightseeing. The pool area was pleasant with good service. The room was typical Four Seasons, though it did seem smaller than their other locations. The only negative was the casual restaurant. It seemed to be just a step above a TGIFridays, and the service was not very polished. The bread was stale, and it took a long time to get food. At the breakfast buffet, used plates piled up on our table....never being cleared. The entertainment in the lounge was also very loud. However, these two negative would not turn me away from a future stay at this hotel....I just wouldn't eat here for dinner. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Pleasant stay...but not stellar,
"This hotel lived up to my expectations. It has an excellent location in my opinion, close enough to Orchard Rd that we could walk easily, and far enough from Orchard Rd so that it was very quiet. Service was excellent in this hotel, from the moment we checked in, when I used the 3rd floor pool, when I used the gym. The complimentary breakfast was excellent. Of course, the room looks a bit outdated (considering this is not a new hotel), but they have kept them in pristine and clean condition. All in all, I was very satisfied. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel,
"Four Seasons Singapore is a phenomenal hotel - although it is away from much of the fun (unless you have a fortune to spend on Orchard Road).  I would definitely stay here again.  On a side note, my girlfriend and I saw John Travolta in the lobby at 1AM as we were checking in! ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Plush,
"Have just returned from a wonderful stay at Four Seasons. This was a family trip with an elderly mother. The professional staff could not have been kinder. We(party of 3 daughters and one son with mother) stayed in two executive suites and one deluxe double. Rooms were spotless, superbly equipped and very comfortable. Concierge was amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Staff at breakfast were excellent, after a couple of days we were recognised, which was nice. Health club facilities and staff first rate. We had an early departure and the wake up call was followed by a welcome cup of tea. Cannot rate this hotel too highly on all counts. Delighted to stay again.

"We moved to the Four Seasons after a not very pleasent stay at The Oriental. The hotel is very well located at Orchard road , connected via The Hilton. The reception is small but luxury. The staff are friendly and check in quick. There was a really nice cake for my partner 40th birthday. We booked a weekend break which comes with breakfast and free tennis lessons. We arrived after the Sat lessons but the hotel arranged lessons on Sunday especially for us. The rooms are nce and specious but in some need of renovation. The breakfast is nice but not great. The pools are clean and relaxing. Overall the hotel is better then The Oriental, expecially based on service but far worst then Shangri-La. If you want a reallly hotel in Singapore, there is only one place: Shangri-La. ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,very nice,
"As title says we had an excellent time here over two nights. Lovely room (normal size). Breakfast very nicely laid out with huge variety. Staff could not have been more helpful or friendly. Superb huge shower in marble bathroom. Roof pool refreshing with views. Recommend botanical gardens 20 mins walk up the road, little india interesting as is the river area. Eat in the food halls for huge variety and v cheap prices. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Could not have asked for better..,
"From the moment we arrived - very early - till the time we left everything was sensational. Room, food, service - excellent. We also stayed at Raffles which was a great experience but the service at the 4S was better and it was great value for money. This is probaly one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The only downfall would be the rooftop pool, but you don't go to Singapore to lie beside a pool. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Can't rate this hotel highly enough,
I probably cannot afford to pay for this hotel if I was on holiday on my own. Very nicely designed rooms. Large spacious toilets. Clean. Nothing much to complain actually except that the buffet breakfast should have a bit more selection and they should have provided free drinking water. Very good location . ,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,High Quality,
"i visited during March 2005.  I liked Singapore much better than expected--the flowers and botanical garden are great.  The hotel location is very good.  the room was extremely nice and the Chinese restaurant was outstanding.  The concierges were extremely helpful with great restaurant recommendations.  Overall, among the top 10 hotels I have stayed at worldwide.  Two suggestions: (1) upgrade TVs to plasma.  The football games would be much better and (2) the breakfast buffet selection is not as good as many other top Asian hotels, e.g. the 4S in Shanghai or the Peninsula in Bangkok.  Over an extended stay, I like more variety for breakfast.  I will definitely be a repeat visitor! ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel,
"Outstanding in every respect.  I stayed here in March and again in April, first in a suite and then a deluxe room.

",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A great hotel!,
"I could not find one thing wrong with this hotel. You are treated like royalty, the staff are superb. The hotel is perfectly placed for a stroll into town.
