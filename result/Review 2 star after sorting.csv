A lovely group of professional and attendtive staff - who have become friends over the years). We stayed for 2 weeks. But the experience was very disappointing.

Stayed for 2 nights in the hotel and while it's an architectural marvel the level of service is more along the line of midscale hotels.  When you mention this to the staff they quickly remind you how big the hotel is.  Be prepared to que and be prepared to serve yourself.  ,2.0,Marina Bay Sands Hotel,,,,Self Service Hotel,
"I chose this hotel for its location around different malls. However, do remember that this is an old hotel and everything in it is very well used. The most evident is the aircon system, which works, but pumps out air that isn't fresh and hard to breathe with. The pool's filtration system is questionable too - with many debris and a salty taste when you accidentally get some water in your mouth",2.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,It's an old hotel,
"Sonia very helpful and professional.  Prompt to our request.  Good service and we enjoy our lunch very much !  Wish to come here again to enjoy the great services   In short, very good service and professional.",2.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Good service,
"The room had a musty smell and looks a little rundown, toilet floor was dusty. Certainly didn't felt like a 5 star hotel to me. Very limited choice of food for breakfast. Pool was good, allowed more than 1.5 hours of stay there.",2.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,Pan Pacific Singapore not worth the amount paid,
Dont use the wakeup call. If you will be late answering them by 15 minutes they will break into your room. If you complain they dont hear you. then they force you to priny 200 words in order to advertise it.,2.0,Pan Pacific Hotel,,,,The hotel does honor yout privacy,
"Cons: - Waited 1.5 hours to check-in. Check in time was at 3pm. We reached at 3.30pm but had to waited till 5pm to check-in. - Phone operator hung up on me - Room service food was below average. Nasi goreng tasted like chinese fried rice. Pizza bread was soft. - Pool area looked a bit run down   Pros - They gave us free drinks while waiting for the check-in. - They gave us a late check out at 12.30pm (instead of 12nn), they pushed it to 1pm after I requested for more time. - Gym was big - They allowed me to leave my car at the drop-off point",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,"Slow check-in, rude ohone operator.",
"Called to check-in but told me they cant accommodate due to high occupancy. I do understand that. Went on the day of check-in at 2.50pm. Check-in time should be 3pm and end of the day we checked in around 4.30pm. A 5-star shouldnt have problems with this. Should buckle up their service given to customers. Manpower might be an issue, but for a 5-star hotel checking in at this hour isnt acceptable. Room is okay but isnt as clean as we hoped for. The toilet floor was still wet when we came in. Hope to see more improvements in the future or else i wouldnt even consider to come back here for my second visit. ",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Disastrous ,
I booked the Deluxe  room with patio . The dining table was infested with ants. The Singapore govt policy allow 2 people in same room and 2 social gatherings/day. But the hotel set their own rule that prohibit 1 visitor  even though the max people is 2 ( including registered guest )in the room.,2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Boring and below expectation,
"I never ever eat such a Eggs Benedict.   The bread was croissants and the sauce was just a large amount of mayonnaise. It's just mayonnaise. It was probably made by a person who had never eaten Egg benetict. Even a cheap hotel wouldn't want to put such a food on the menu list. Surprisingly, it took 40 minutes.   I'm sure this hotel won't survive. I've stayed at various hotels, but this hotel isn't worth the price. You had better stay at Goodwood or Hilton.",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Breakfast is terrible!,
"Can't say that i am going to choose it again. It only has the advantage of the surrounding view and parks beside this i had a problem with Ants and other problems in bathroom tabs. Also it's so close to the partying place so you can still hear the DJ & music while staying in your room, maybe because my trip was for work so i didn't enjoy this part :)    with that being said, i may still recommend it for people who are looking for great nature views and parks and it also located in a short walking distances to many other good places in Singapore.",2.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,6 days' stay,
"I had a poor experience here while on business. The hotel has a faulty fire alarm system which went off several times overnight on two separate nights. The only compensation offered was free laundry. The staff appear newly trained and are very ""in your face"" from the moment you enter the lobby. They could improve by relaxing a little and having greater respect for peoples privacy and space.",2.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Faulty fire alarm system,
"Stayed for a week in Sept for work. Great hotel and location. Decent food options.  Checked out, few weeks later happen to review the invoice. Found incorrect charges and reached out to the hotel staff. They send an email back asking me to tell them what are the wrong charges - utterly absurd and clueless. Weeks of conversation later the manager makes refunding the wrong charge seem as if a favor is being done. I wonder if every customer (whether P Elites or otherwise) should take a double scan at their JW invoices.  Poor accountability. Takes weeks for the line-managers to respond. Given the incredible options in Singapore, I'd give this a miss on my next trip.",2.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Great hotel, flawed billing and management",
