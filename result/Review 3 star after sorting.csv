"We experienced a rocky start to our stay at Hotel Fort Canning when our room safe stopped working with our valuables inside it.   Thanks to Dayan at front reception our trip significantly improved when he was able to offer us a free room upgrade. Dayan went the extra mile, showed care and was attentive to greeting us and helping us each time he saw us. He deserves to be commended. His service was excellent.   Before booking at Hotel Fort Canning, be mindful that you will need to walk 5 steep flights of stairs coming / going from the hotel given its situated as a fort.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Dayan Saves The Day,
"Room is nice. Hotel staff were polite. But hotel policies on some matters are disappointing   E.g only one carpark coupon per day.  E.g when I asked for more water , they said only two bottles are provided each day.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice hotel but poor policies,
"seamless easy check in, kudos to front desk Shana and Salon Ruby for providing assistance when required. room was cosy and nice, need improvement to reduce the sound on the air con air blower, was abit loud at night. Salon restaurant's menu needs to be improved and restaurant need refurbishment, seems old. the blinds at the window suggest to have 2 layers, one semi transparent and one dark, so that in the day time can use the semi transparent blind, to allow some light to come in",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,exploring staycation on a hill,
"My room was ok.  Comfortable bed and pillows.  Nicely appointed bathroom.  Strange to have the windows all along the bathroom.  Breakfast was a letdown.  Getting taxis takes some time.

"Location,quietness, staff, breakfast and bed quality were all suberb, unfortuanately the room (107) was looking a bit tired! The bath was surrounded rectangular raised tiles  making the room very dangerous to walk around day and especially nighttime! Also the toilet and shower were located in the bedroom meaning that any smell and steam generated wern't contained in a room with an extractor fan - what was the designer thinking!",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Interesting rooms!,
"The location of HFC is great as Fort Canning is right at the doorstep and Orchard Road is also within walking distance. The lap pool and gym are both wonderful for those keen on some serious exercise.   A few things however, marred our stay and made it less than satisfying.  The Nespresso machine wasnt working properly and neither was the weighing scale in the bathroom. There was mould on the door of the shower cubicle and some of the towels are beginning to look tired i.e. frayed seams. We asked for extra floor mat and were given bath towels instead. All in all, the housekeeping department needs some polishing up.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice but could be better,
Poor sound proofing. I could hear the voices coming from the room opposite my room even with both our doors closed and a corridor separating us  The bed quality can certainly improved. I struggled to have any sleep... Big plus points for the pool facilities with NASA treated chlorine-free water.,3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Poor sound proofing,
"Hi the hotel and staff was really nice. I liked the serenity.  Only thing we felt the carpets along the staircase especially didn't smell too fresh.  Otherwise the hotel is nice, cosy n clean.

"Pros Nice hotel, very calm location, Nice rooms Cons I arrived at 6am in the morning, I was made to wait for 4hours in the reception till 11am to get a room. Their checkin time is 2pm. But I had booked for 5days stay by paying around 1500 dollars. Hence they could have given me preference.  choice of food for inrroom service is too less. You wont find aything eatable from that menu.",3.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Nice hotel...but beware dont go there early...,
"stayed during valentine's day and it was a surprise move from my husband. The hotel should add day curtains or one way see thru window from room to protect guest privacy, the hotel should also consider one switch for each blind control. we left home late night and came back the next early morning, to my surprise the things in the room moved. maybe they thought i check out? bathroom only have one glass cup? suppose to have two. i had tomyam soup in the glass house but it tasted like plum soup.  afterall, jasmin the manager was very helpful and attentive she will assist you in all ways.

"The room was big at 100sqm but the bed size was kinda pathetic to just only be a queen size bed. Huge bathrooms and living area. Fridge was in a hidden cupboard, very sleek and classy look for the whole suite. Service was great as well, even just by taking the elevator together with the staff, we will be greeted by them. Best place to be if you're having a conference at Suntec City due to the proximity. However the lights in the room can be quite dim, making it hard to work at night due to all the warm lighting.",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,"Good location, Minutes walk to Suntec City",
"Stayed here for 2 nights. Great location. Good service and nice pool and food.   However, the check in and check out is very slow. It took us 30 mins to check out.   The room was also very wierd design. Avoid room 464. ",3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Good location but weird and small rooms. ,
For a JW this fell bit short in my opinion. Rooms though spacious has metal chairs which give a low cost look. Housekeeping was somewhat lacking and had to be called and reminded to make up room. Breakfast restaurant and staff excellent and choice of cuisine very good. It's a nice property and well located if attending exhibitions or events around Marina Sands Bay but for the price one would pay it can ramp up its offer more.,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Not So Impressive,
This JW Marriott in Singapore provides a very modern style of design. The hotel also provides very attentive staff throughout the hotel. If you like modern style hotels this is a very good choice of hotel to proceed with.,3.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Modern design and very good service,
"We had our high school graduation ball there yesterday. Everything was fine but I admit I am utterly disappointed when a 5 Star hotel is unable to serve one table at the time. I had at least 4 times to call the waiter to show him That food was still missing but they a started already the next table. Sorry Shangri la, I would have expected much better from you .",3.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Ball room experience ,

The staff and hotel was absolutely amazing. Beautiful area and even more beautiful rooms and hotel lounging areas. But the only problem we had was checking in to our room. Our plane got in at 5 AM and of course we knew we wouldn't be able to check in to the room at that time. The front desk staff knew of our dilemma but continued to clean other vacant rooms first. It would've been nice if they could've put our premium suite on priority so we could get in as soon as the previous guests checked out. At $800 a night they should've been able to help out and be a little more concerned with our situation. ,3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Could've Accommodated Better ,
"We stayed in one of the enhanced premier suites last summer in Ritz Carlton Millenia.  We also had the club access. You have to queue for breakfast for at  least 15 minutes in the lobby, very big hotel and very little personalized service. We realised that they forgot to give us information on kids activities in the hotel although we spend there 5 nights. We once had a late cleaning and we actually had to call the reception to request cleaning of our room. It is more of a business hotel than a leasure hotel. Overall, you pay a very high price for an ordinary service.",3.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Avarage Stay in every aspect,
"The hotel is conveniently located on the Orchard Road and has a good gym and nice swimming pool. There is a spa - I asked for a pedicure and was told the lady wasn't based on the site so they would have to call and see if she was free (which she wasn't). Given we were in Singapore and a leading hotel one would think there would be a back up. The hotel felt a old fashioned and tied. The staff were very helpful and breakfast was delicious - they make lovely healthy juices for you. At the sister hotel, The Regent, 5 mins around the corner, is the Manhattan Bar which is worth a visit",3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Standard,
"The location of the hotel is good if you want to be within walking distance of Orchard Road. However the hotel feels dated when compared to other hotels in Singapore.

"Location was good, easy access to orchard road with lot of shopping. Service staff was friendly and helpful.

Having just come from the Pen in HK and the Banyan Tree in Phuket this was an extremely average experience. The club facilities were worthless. Nice building and pleasant staff but something was missing! ,3.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Average,
