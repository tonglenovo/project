"Struggled to find our way to Gardens at the bay and back to the hotel.  Need better signage.

"Well located Hotel within easy walking distance to the Marina Bay harbour. Hotel is part of the Marina Square shopping centre which through the One Raffles Link connects with the City Link Mall and enables patrons to walk practically underground all the way to the City Hall MRT station and stay out of the Singapore heat & haze. City Hall MRT station enables you to get to Orchard Road shopping via rail. The pool area is a great place to rest at the end of the day, with plenty of seating around the pool. Stayed in a Harbour View Studio on the 32nd level which was a beautifully appointed room, spacious in size, had a great bath and views of the Marina Bay harbour. Good choice of breakfasts & coffee from the Marketplace and the bar in the Atrium is a great place to have a drink at the end of the day. Enjoyed the dinner buffet at the Edge Restaurant, where there were at least 10 different food stations, with an amazing range of food options including seafood, such as oysters, lobster & grilled octopus.

"We arrived at The Fullerton Hotel in the early hours of the morning. The concierge staff immediately made us welcome, collected our bags and allowed us full use of all hotel facilities including the pool and spa until our room was ready for check in. We went straight to the pool deck, where waiter staff offered us fresh juices and smoothies and ensured we were as comfortable as possible.
Our room was ready for check-in early, however  we didn't feel pressure to leave the pool to check in. When we finally checked-in the staff had upgraded us to one of their recently refurbished Premier Marina Bay View rooms as we were recently married and celebrating our honeymoon.
Everything in the room was new, clean and comfortable. We have stayed in a number of 5 star hotels around the world, but this was one of the most lavish we had stayed. Our own private balcony overlooked the iconic Marina Bay, and provided us a money cant buy perspective.
We only had an overnight stay, so we ordered in-room dining. Effortless to order via their in-room tablet. Enjoyed a nice meal with a glass of champagne each, whilst watching the Spectra light show in Marina Bay.
We are already planning to return to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary.",5.0,The Fullerton Hotel,2019,Australia,Marina Bay View King Room,"Celebrating our honeymoon, the staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was memorable.",Couple

"We didn't stay at the Hotel, but visited the shops (which were very posh) & we wanted to visit the top.  My husband worked out that it was better value to go up to the bar & have a drink - as the set price to go up to the bar (drink 'included') was better value than the cost to just up to the top. From the bar you see beyond the viewing platform, plus also get a view of that superb pool ....! The views around Singapore from the top were just outstanding.

"The hotel itself is very nice; the staff are great ... friendly and helpful. There are various options for eating. But, probably the best thing about the hotel is its location: right at the doorstep to the marina and attached to a mall (although there are many malls in Singapore).  We like to take the Hop-on-and-Off when we go to a new city to orient ourselves with the place and the starting point for these buses was (almost) attached to the hotel, i.e. the other side of the mall. Although our room was listed as ""Deluxe"" it wasn't large for a hotel room. This is probably due to the value of space in Singapore. But, it was reasonably equipped.

"Every staff member you interact with genuinely wants to help you. Often anticipating your needs, like bringing cold water to your sun bed without being asked. It is the attention to detail that makes this hotel special. Check out is at 12.00, our flight was at 11.45 PM. We were told to carry on using the pool facilities and then come and ask for a ""shower room"" where when after retrieving our luggage we had an hour to shower and change ready for our flight home. It was a wonderful end to a very pleasant stay.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,What a fantastic hotel.,
"Ideally situated for most things in Singapore and within walking distance of major sites. We had a harbour view which gave us a magnificent view of the the evening light and laxer show. Food in the hotel is good but pricey, as one would expect. If you want to experience the local culture eat at Gluttons Makkan centre just across the road where you can eat well very cheaply. We used it a lot. The rooms in the hotel are beautiful and everything to be expected. You can walk across the helical bridge near hotel to Marina Sands with its shopping mall and the gardens, a must visit. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again when in Singapore.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Great Place to stsy,
"We had a fantastic 4 nights stay here. Great location. Room on 19th floor with stunning Marina Bay views. Well worth paying the supplement just for those views. Cleanliness and service was excellent. Beds are so comfortable. Staff polite and friendly. Bay @ 5 bar is great to relax with a drink. We had dinner at Dolce Vita one night and food/service was very good.  Pool area is very nice and we relaxed there for a couple of hours each day. Winko one of the pool/bar attendants was so friendly and attentive and looked after us exceptionally well. Full marks to Winko, he is a credit to the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here on our next visit.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Fabulous Stay,
city view is poor. especially low levels.  but upgraded to sweet room. room conditions is very good. thanks! the hotel is closed to shopping center and makansutra hoker.  Marina bay sands and gardensby the bay is within walking distance.it takes about 10~15minutes to walk. ,4.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Bay view is recommended,
"The hotel is centrally located to popular sights like the Art and Science museum and Garden By the Bay. The MRT (Esplanade) and Marina mall is steps away from the hotel. There is a currency exchange office in the mall with much better rates (if needed) and many other stores and eateries. Access to pedestrian walkway for those wanting to get in a run is just outside the hotel door. Hotel has classy Asian decor with many fresh orchid displays. The marina view rooms offer outstanding views of both the city and Marina Sands Hotel, the best of both views! Breakfast buffet has fantastic selection of food and were very accommodating if we wanted to get an espresso to take back to our room. Overall we had an amazing stay and with all women traveling felt very safe at the Mandarin.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,Centrally located and spectacular view,

The pool area is great and roomy and the service there is first class. Breakfast in the Melt Cafe is a delight with huge choice both in terms of national dishes or just simple continental breakfast.

"I stayed in this hotel for three nights and I absolutely loved this place. My most favorite would be the pool...I must say Mandarin Oriental has the best pool view in SG, you can see both the Marina bay view and Marina Bay Sands from the pool. This hotel locates in the perfect location, it's very close to all the major attraction in Singapore such as Marina Bay, The Sands and the shopping centers. However, the only thing that was a little bit disappointed was the quality of the bed and pillows. I was so surprised for how poor of these stuffs in this luxurious hotel to the point that I had to call the hotel and asked to change the pillow (and almost the bed, it's really soft and didn't feel like I was staying in Mandarin Oriental Hotel at all.",5.0,Mandarin Oriental,,,,"Amazing Pool View, Excellent Area, Great Service but just ok room",

The deluxe room was spacious, with a high ceiling, very nice interiors, mirrored closet, comfortable sheets, and above all really nice glass bathroom with a city view. By far this is the best pool that we had in SG, it's chlorine-free. The only downside we experienced is the way going to the pool, as you need to go through the car park, instead of direct access from the second level.

"The parkland location comes with much history and the Hotel itself is well designed to create a friendly and relaxing atmosphere. All staff  were very willing to assist us with our queries about what to do in Singapore on a short visit.  We found the parkland picturesque and a pleasure to wander through, the pool ares were extremely well presented (with pools to meet all needs) and the bar & dining areas relaxing and friendly.  The Hotel's central location meant it was only a short taxi ride to most of the tourist spots, and with the humidity in Singapore that is the go.

The showers and toilets follow a very open room concept. Maybe a bit too much so but that is a matter of taste. The rooms have a significant lack of power outlets so charging phones and cameras was a bit tricky. We had the Feeling that the room was altogether a bit too much built for style over practicality.

The room is amazing with the bathtub in the middle of the room. Its a very well set up room but lacks floor space. Love the outside balcony. The service was very efficient   Only thing they could improve on is the room service food. The plate up of the food ect.   I work for a hotel back in Melbourne in the kitchen so I have high expectations when it comes to room service food.  But overall a very good experience. Slightly pricey but worth it if you money to spend.,4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,The shower was our favourite part,

The building was a the British Officers and then Japanese Officers Quarters during WW2 and has a sense of history about it. You can explore the bunkers within the old Fort Canning as well as roam around the beautiful parks. It is close to Orchard Rd, and Clarke Quay. Very central to get almost anywhere in Singapore with Dhoby Gaut MRT station and interchange only 300m walk.

"I booked this room for my daughters. They both stayed at this hotel for a few nights and said it was really lovely. Apparently everything about it was good - they said the room was luxurious, the pool was divine and the food was very above average but apparently there were two things that made it a little special. The first was the fact that it was located in the middle of a lovely parkland away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The second was the staff courtesy - apparently quite outstanding.

We were able to walk everywhere including Orchard Road, Chinatown and Clarke Quay. The rooms were comfortable and the staff at the hotel were always helpful. Good facilities too including a coffee machine in the room. The best extra had to be the Handy device.

I would definitely recommend staying here for the location and the facilities.  ",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great location. Lovely room,
"We took a premier room overlooking the park and it would have been excellent except that there wasn't any sleeping robe in the wardrobe which my husband thought was quite a crucial element missing from this 5-star hotel.

"Quiet, tucked in greenery, great service usually. This was our 3rd or 4th stay in the last year. Yes we love this place!   However, on this visit, the room was dusty. There was visible dust on the floor when we checked in (areas under the table & arm chair). But this issue was solved when we alerted one of the cleaning crew & he used a wet dust mop to clean the dust away. Wasn't too impressed with the fact that there was dust in the first place.   Gave this feedback during check out & they said they'll be fixing this.   Everything else was almost perfect! Love the pool, room & service from staff was excellent!

"The quiet pool side surrounded by dense green jungle and flowers was especially a treat.  The staff are all very friendly, the ambiance just takes you back into a different time.  Really beautiful place.  However, a very important thing that separates a 5 star hotel from those beneath is flexibility.  I had a family emergency that required me to check out 2 days earlier than originally planned but management flat out refused to refund me for the last two days.  This is the first 5 star hotel in all my travels that treated me this way.  The short-sightedness of choosing immediate profit over loyal return business is unfortunate and is what disqualifies it as a 5 star hotel.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Beautiful take you back in time place but NOT 5 stars,

It felt like we were staying in the middle of botanical gardens - though there was a lot of walking up and down stairs to reach to our destinations. Within the grounds is the Pinacoteque de Paris, an unexpected delight as we were able to view the most marvellous European paintings on our own! Our room was comfortable and well set up. The breakfasts were very good. Walking distance to the National Gallery, Clarke Quay, Orchard Rd etc. Would certainly stay here again.

The inside is modern, clean, and the breakfast is superb. The location is very interesting -- easy walk to the National Museum, Art Gallery, Spice Gardens, and Dhobi Ghaut MRT station. What more can you ask for? Ah yes, there is one thing -- a stronger wi-fi signal in the rooms. The wi-fi is very good in the public areas but the hotel expects you to use wired internet in the rooms. What about people who rely on their smart phones for everything?",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Great hotel in the middle of Singapore,

Food at the Glass House is varied and yummy - we would also want to commend Mr Gangga and his team for their high service standards, which always come with a smile.

Breakfast was lovely and the chef took delight in cooking our eggs with care each morning. Thank you!

Although the hotel had 100% occupancy the night before they still manged to get us into our room by 10am - offering free coffee/tea/biscuits and fruit. The room was beautiful and one of the nicest bathrooms we have utilised.

Given the outlook & design of the hotel, it definitely feels like I wasn't in Singapore at all. The location may be slightly away from any transportation apart from Taxi, however it is really very peaceful to be in. I look forward in more staycation with this property again.

Wow. I have just returned from a six day visit to Singapore with my brother to visit places where we once lived. We choose the Hotel Fort Canning for its location and character of building where our father possible once worked in the 1950's. Our choice was perfect. The hotel is finished to a very high standard and the staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. On our last day we were allowed to keep our room for an extra couple of hours and our luggage was then stored ready for collection for our night flight home.

It took a little while to work out all the electrical switches to pull the blinds up and down for some privacy in the bathroom but apart from that, the location more than made up for this.  Loved the location in the park and the sheer peace and quiet.  On one of the days we had the entire pool to ourselves.  Taxis are freely available to take you into the city at night as at the time we stayed few people were eating in the hotel and it was a little soulless.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Peaceful Oasis in a garden setting,
"The quietest place I've stayed in Singapore. It is in a park setting in the CBD. Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, but walking there requires negotiating a significant hill.  Staff and service excellent.  Pool facilities delightful - two of them - also an excellent free espresso station throughout the day, good free internet service, and free wine and snack service in the evening. I've usually stayed at the Stamford, which is more convenient for the MRT traveler (as I am).  But I would stay here again. Clients paid for the rooms so I can't give recommmendations on price, and I am a minimal user of hotel services. Free internet, coffee, pools and evening drinks put this above the Stamford, which on the other hand has greater MRT convenience and spectacular city views from high floors.",4.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Peaceful and elegant,
"While the hotel is an historic building the interior is very modern. It's well located to the CBD and Orchard Rd. Lovely pools and grounds. The hotel gym is exceptional with plenty of equipment.  The rooms are large for Singapore hotels.  Bed is very comfortable and bathroom is terrific.  Shower could do with a rethink, shower head for rain like feel is 9 feet above and hand held is literally hand held - sensible to have a simple addition of placement of hand held above head height.  There is a common platform for turning on lights, air conditioning and lifting and closing blinds - system is logical but takes a little while to grow accustomed to.  Food for breakfast was perfectly fine.  Service was excellent although check in and out took a little time.  Would happily stay again.",5.0,Hotel Fort Canning,,,,Excellent,

Hai Yang went above and beyond when cleaning our room, Hazel had great suggestions for places to visit, and Melvin made wonderful drinks.  I loved the location- being across from SunTec made it very easy to catch the MRT, a bus, or call a Grab to go out and see the city.

Though the city is filled with good cuisine, I didn't feel like going out and on impulse decided to try the Akira Black. Turned out to be a great decision. The food (I had the striploin and the wagyu fried rice) was super, the presentation had a nice flair and touch. Hanny and the staff there made this quite a memorable meal - Great food, superb presentation and attentive service.

"Design of the lobby and lifts were great. we were offered in lounge check in. As they arrived on the redeye- we didn't expect their room to be ready quite yet and it wasn't. Staff there seem unable/unwilling to find someone who spoke Chinese for my guests, but perhaps it was just a misunderstanding. Room was comfortably sized and captured Singapore's skyline well. Lounge offerings were great but the lounge didn't offer any views. Location was great- it's in close proximity to several malls and there were nice restaurants/bars just below the hotel.  Check out was efficient and there weren't any erroneous charges.",4.0,JW Marriott Hotel,,,,Fabulous location,

The service at any hotel is something that allways leaves a lasting impression on a guest and Hazel who works in the Executive Lounge made sure we were well looked after every day.

Food was excellent (though only had breakfast and working lunch) and the health club facilities as good as you get in most hotels. The staff, regardless of their role, were polite and extremely helpful. From the business perspective we were also very well looked after. Close to Dempsey St if you want to get outside and while a little further from the main CBD etc with the taxi prices everywhere is within reach.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,5 star experience,

Each evening we enjoyed complimentary champagne, wine and spirits while listening to the beautiful harp player in the lounge. The rooms are spacious with lovely products in the bathroom.  The hotel facilities are beautiful, a very large spacious gym, clean pool area with comfy deck chairs and the high tea served in the garden was delicious.

"The buffet spread was simply over the top. By over the top I mean the different types of food offered to diners, international and local. My favourite was the chilli crab (very meaty) with the sweet sauce and fried bun; grilled lamb chops and prawns; fresh seafood i.e. prawns, mussels, clams, crabs; roasted prime beef, slow-baked fish; veeeeeery rich and flavourful seafood porridge and condiments. Friedly managers, Hatim and Gobi made sure we had a good dining experience.

Each was so welcoming, friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic,  whilst still displaying total professionalism. They showed pride in providing exceptional customer service to one and all.

"We flew in for 2 days in Singapore and our travel agents had booked us into the Valley wing of the Shangri-la hotel. This was probably the best hotel experience we have ever had! World class room, world class service and world class ambience. The best observation I can make is that it was like staying in your own home with an infinite number of attentive, friendly staff to make your life perfect. Breakfast is brilliant with excellent chefs but sipping champagne in the lobby has already become a byword for luxury for us. We shall return.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,The best hotel ever?,
"The Valley Wing is quiet and beautiful, staff were fab and the free 'British' tea and drinks was really nice. The rooms were quite old fashioned but they had a nice cozy feel to them.

Wish our stay was longer!",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Absolutely loved this hotel!,
Good hotel in well developed gardens just off Orchard Road. Has excellent amenities and good sized rooms. I stayed in the garden wing which has a balcony overlooking the city. Hotel slightly let down by failure to allow late check outs without payment of day use charge and a breakfast that tries and does cater for every option but where quality comes second.,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Return stay,
"Decided to have a family dinner to kick start 2019, and decided to revisit The Line again. The spread was excellent but what stood out the most during the dinner was one of their chefs running the pasta station. His name is Bryan. Greeted with a warm smile and remained calm and confident even though the orders are piling up when I visited the station. He gladly took my order and it was executed perfectly. Always a pleasure to see such young talent out there, servicing this industry. It takes passion and drive to motivate ourself to be standing on your feet for 10 hours a day.

"We spent 3 days and nights. The property is spectacular. Didn't use the Spa or gym, but saw the facilities and they are amazing. Our only complaint is that 2 of the 3 restaurants were booked to wedding parties, so the only restaurant available was the Chinese restaurant. The Bar is AMAZING, and the bartender, Adam Eddy Bursik, is fantastic. They ven re-distill alcohol to make flavored alcohols. The Christmas Gin is incredible. It actually tastes like Christmas.

"We have stayed at the Shangri-La in Singapore numerous times. We were disappointed to see the red and gold panels in the lobby had been replaced with a live wall of plants, a pool and some odd figures. It could be Rome, Paris or London, it has lost its Asian feeling. But the rooms was lovely and service great. We had dinner in the Line restaurant and it took ages for food to arrive and it seemed a bit chaotic. However, in general it is a wonderful hotel. We were fans of the new bar which is off the lobby.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Amazing Hotel, Great Service",

There are also several restaurants within the hotel offering local cuisine as well as Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and steak.  The restaurants also cater to travelers with celiac as they offered multiple gluten friendly options.  Finally, the hotel is a great place for families as it offers a dedicated breakfast area, a kid's baking kitchen, and swimming pool, and an indoor playscape.  The only downside is that the prices are a little steep and its a 15 min walk or more for other food options.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Best of the Best,

Furthermore we were provided both a high chair and buggy.  The facilities were wonderful - our older one loved the Buds and he went there everyday.  due to meeting relatives (try to avoid going at weekends as its super busy), it is a shame that we did take more advantage of the wet play and pool areas.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Luxurious hotel that is totally kid friendly!,

"Shangri-la Singapore is special in it's landscaping, location and sheer size. It also has a fabulous pool. However, the breakfast at Line was slightly underwhelming (Shangri-la Yangon's breakfast is at least twice as interesting and scrumptious), staff friendliness can ostensibly vary (the lifeguard was grumpy), and they made a mistake with our reservation dates. Overall, just by virtue of size, location and landscaping (it's like a resort smack in the center of Singapore), it gets a 4-star rating. ",4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Impressive landscaping ,

"Simply perfect. I genuinely can't fault a single thing about this hotel.  It was the first place we stayed on our honeymoon. The first night, with grand plans of heading out for a lovely meal at a fancy restaurant, we liked it so much we stayed in!  We upgraded to a slightly bigger room and access to the Horizon Club. Definitely worth the money getting access to the club, especially for the drinks and nibbles between 5-7!  It's one of the fanciest places I've stayed, and I'm so glad that every part of the experience with them was flawless.",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,Perfect,
"We had three nights in Shanghai-La Hotel, Singapore. We will like to come back. Beautiful hotel, excellent rooms, excellent breakfast, very clean, very friendly staff.  It is situated a little outside the centre of the city which we liked. Access to the centre is easy. We stayed in the top floors and had lovely view over Singapore.  The last day before leaving for the airport was spent in the garden by the pool. Lovely and relaxing. We had lunch in the outdoor restaurant before leaving for the airport. But service there was very slow, so if you are doing the same, I would recommend you to do that in good time before you have to change clothes and leave for the airport. This was the only disadvantage.   I highly recommend Shangri-La Singapore. An excellent hotel. ",5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,An excellent stay,

FIRST RATE OPERATION --It is old and has been redone but without losing it's charm---this is the first Shangri-La built and the concept has done well--This place is very business and family oriented so it gets a little frenentic but we love it. We always get premium rooms and the Horizon club to make best use of the facilities.  My favorite is the S L in Hong Kong  becuse the premium rooms are on the same floor as the Horizon Club.,5.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,MY GO-TO HOTEL IN ASIA,
Stayed here for four days prior to starting a cruise. A beautiful hotel but very pricey when it comes to buying drinks and restaurant prices. We found it much better to enjoy the many restaurants Singapore has to offer. ,4.0,Shangri-La Singapore,,,,"Excellent hotel, but pricey ",
"The beautiful grounds and pool were the drawcard for us for a girls weekend, but I would come back for the service. We stayed at the Valley Wing where we were looked after by Raja and Aishah who were delightful and very helpful. Service was amazing. We had originally booked into the Horizon Club, but upgraded to Valley to include the Champagne Bar which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet at the Line offered an amazing array of international foods, but we could have chosen to eat at the quieter, more serene restaurant in the Valley.  The Line was very busy on the weekend. The rooms were very generously sized. The decor is very traditional, and the clientele older, but I would splurge for the Valley Wing  if you get the chance.

They have also got a huge indoor playground- Buds with slides, ball pool, sandpit, shooting areas.   Our check in was pretty quick and in house staff was quite helpful. You got to check their swimming pool with hot jacuzzi and trust me it was so relaxing.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals at Waterfall restaurant and Buffet at Line with a  wide range of spread.

"This buffet was amazing and had so many options and choices of food to eat. Definitely plan on at least an hour as you'll want to eat slowly and eat a lot. Everything we had was delicious - from the eggs benedict to the fresh honey and fresh squeezed juices to the dim sum and decadent desserts.   If I could give an extra star (6 star) - it would be due to Lee Lee's excellent service. She was so helpful, catered to everything we could even want, and just was over the top nice. We loved talking to her and she is an amazing server. Next time I come back, I'm definitely bringing my mom and we will definitely see Lee Lee again.

"I took my family on a short stay at the Ritz in Singapore from 20-22 October. I had chosen a Deluxe room and upon entering things seemed fine but the reality was that the shower in the tub for the kids leaked and it went all over the bathroom. I went down and spoke with the front desk and within 30 minutes they had said that they were going to move us to a new room. They were swift, apologetic and helpful. The new room was a Suite and it was terrific. To top it off they set up a tent for our kids in the room as part of the Ritz Kids program and after coming back from the pool on Saturday there was a dessert platter and a bottle of champagne from the staff. Unexpected and just shows the level of service that the Ritz provides. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Salty to Sweet,

"The Ritz Carlton is in the thick of it for the Singapore GP weekend.  It would be hard to find a buzzier place on the planet for three hectic days, and then the caravan moves on!  The hotel copes with all tis very well, serving breakfast in two locations until about 2pm (so F1 people can remain on European time).  The bar at night after race or practice is also a fun place to be.  Having only ever stayed during race week, it's hard to comment on how the hotel performs at other times.  But my feeling is that if they can cope with GP week, everything else will seem easy.  Nice pool, adequate gym, and superb marina views.  Imperative to spend the money for a marina view.",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Go to hotel for grand prix,

From the time we have checked-in with the front desk with Alvin, till our encounters with Katherine at the Club's lounge. Every staff was professional! The bedroom and bathroom were famously spacious and well-fitted with thoughtful details. The bathrobe was the softest I have encountered and the slippers were thick and cushy! I did feel the scent of the toiletries was kind of 'out-datedly pungent' but this may be personal. The views were stunning from most windows. The Christmas decorations and the food range and displays were Instagram-worthy. Well done Ritz-Carlton Singapore! ",5.0,Ritz-Carlton Hotel,,,,Staycation,

However, we weren't able to get a room on the side of the hotel which faces Marina Bay (We've never been able to manage that!)

"Well maintained hotel!   I have never consider staying at four seasons considering the number of years it has been around. But COVID and Christmas gave us a chance since we had tried most of the hotel around the vicinity.   Upon walking in, hotel smell nice and was well maintained throughout. I had very low expectations of the room but it surpasses me! I asked for an extra bed for our toddler and they also placed kids amenities around. Very nice touch!   Overall, we are very pleased and will consider staying again for the price and location! Well done for keeping such a old building so well kept!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Well maintained hotel and great location!,

"We booked four seasons for a birthday staycation and the service was out of this world. As we have a baby girl, Four Seasons communicated with us before our arrival to find out her age so that they can make the necessary arrangements - eg provided some diapers, baby wash and even a thoughtful diaper bin. Of course, because it was a birthday staycation the cake was already set up in the room during our check in. In addition the staff were all very accommodating to our requests during the stay. We had three staycations since hotels opened for staycation in Singapore and Four Seasons hands down had the best service.

"This is a great hotel pretty much on Orchard road (down a side street). Hotel was beautifully presented for Christmas and the guest rooms were very clean. Guest bathroom also had a luxury feeling to, which some 5 star hotels can lack. Bed was big a comfortable. Good electronics (digital aircon switch, electric blinds etc), arrival cookies. Maybe air conditioning was a bit cold on arrival, but you can alter that once you are in. Overall would stay again. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years and this was definitely worth the spend. Much better than the Hilton around the corner - which I stayed in earlier during the week & is a bit dated considering the money you pay for it.

"A great hotel with real attention to detail. We loved the city view suite which had curtains that automatically opened when entering the room, or via wall switches. The views are stunning, and the rooms fitted out to the highest standard.  The staff were all fantastic. Our only slight criticism was the Michelin Star restaurant, which we felt didn't live up to other Michelin restaurants we have visited.  A few people in the reviews complained that the hotel isn't directly on Orchard Road, however perhaps they didn't realise that there's a discreet door next to the lobby bar which walks you straight into the shopping centre, and will bring you out on Orchard Rd by The Hilton lobby.  We will almost certainly stay here again on our next visit, however we'll eat in other restaurants.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,We weren’t disappointed!,
"Beautiful Hotel. Large comfortable room with fantastic view, great location, morning breakfast is amazing and the service is impeccable.

"I had expected the month of June to be extremely hot and humid, and was pleasantly surprised that it was fairly mild.  Possibly a big reason is that Four Seasons Singapore is only a 'long football kick' from the Orchard underground gems of shopping, eateries and transportation, besides being in walking distances of Shopping Plazas and Hotels.  I travelled mainly alone, but met with members of the family and friends.  It was a time of gelling further with family, and friendships deepened - often over the typically Chinese hospitality over famous Singapore hawker food, or in classy restaurants.  I love Singapore.  I love Four Seasons Hotel Singapore!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,An Excellent Hotel For A Satisfying Break,

Compared to other Four Seasons I have been to around the world--particularly in some vacation spots--this would be on the lower end of the chain.  This may simply be because the hotel gets a lot of use and probably is at the end of its lifecycle before having furniture and carpets replaced.

"I have recently returned from a three night weekend at the Four Seasons Singapore with my teenage daughters. While we did have some issues, what was impressive was the way in which they were dealt with by Reception, and in particular, Zolton the Reception Manager. Inevitably, travel overseas can occasionally involve some anxieties, especially when traveling alone with children, but I was impressed with the thoughfulness and individual concern that my children and I were given. Unquestionally the hotel's faclities are beautiful and the housekeeping outstanding, however, it is the personal service and kindess from staff like Zolton, that we will remember.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Kind and helpful service from reception,

The therapists, professional to the core giving their best for 90 minutes put me at least to sleep with great pampering.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A couple's massage at off-peak gets you 30 minutes more!,
"We have stayed in many Four Seasons Hotels. Too often, the staff at them confuses snide pretentiousness for true hospitality; however in this case, the Four Seasons in Singapore hits things dead center. I asked for a room with an excellent city view and had a gorgeous one indeed. Breakfast was included and outstanding. Best shops on Orchard Rd. are a few steps away.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Staff has a ""must do ""attitude",

The Four Seasons in Singapore is located a 2 minute walk from Orchard Road and also very close to the Botanics. The welcome from service was good and was very surprised at the size of the room and bathroom - both very large.  Had dinner in One Ninety which was good and the choice at breakfast which was amazing.  Pool on 3rd floor next to club room where the staff are very attentive.,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great location and excellent service.,

My room, which was just their standard room was a very good size. Lots of room to move about and work if necessary, and everything looked elegant and classy.  The bathroom huge, with 2 sinks, bath and large walk in shower. The usual L'Occitane toiletries are supplier.   I had lunch in the buffet restaurant which was very good, and breakfast too was nice.   There was a lot of restaurants in the area, and easy to get the tourist day bus if you want to do some sightseeing.   It is pricey but that is what you expect for a luxury 5* and you certainly get what you pay for.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Beautiful elegant hotel with fantastic service,
Close to the shopping district (Orchard) yet amidst peaceful greens. I recommend this for couples or holidaying visitors. Getting to business district isn't a stone throw away and better hotel choices are available around CBD.   Hotel is a couple of bus stops from Botanical garden and nearby lots of food choices. Orchard offers multiple choices for exploring night life and clubs (hotels). Be careful at bargain stores around Far east plaza (they aren't totally honest often).,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Great location, amidst greens yet close to Orchard",
"Can't really fault anything about the stay - quick check-in, upgraded to a suite, late checkout organized (at a price however), excellent staff, great (albeit pricey) room service, fantastic location.

Was on a work trip, but would definitely consider for a personal trip (price permitting!)",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Luxury stay,
We stayed here for three nights as part of a multi-stop overseas trip and were pleasantly surprised by the experience.  The room was large and clean. Treats were placed into the room daily (chocolate covered strawberries anyone :) ? ) and we had plenty of drinking water (bottles). The view from the room was average but to be expected in the centre of the city. We didn't bother the staff and concierge too much as we have been to Singapore many times before but they were helpful when needed The location is good and is within close walking distance of the shops on Orchard Rd.  The gym and pool were adequate The breakfast buffet had great variety and the quality of the food was excellent. We will stay here again next time we are in Singapore!,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great hotel for our short stay,
My wife and I stayed at the 4 seasons after a cruise ending in Singapore.  We arrived at 9am to drop off our luggage and were offed an early checkin.

I would highly recommend and would certainly stay again if we are back in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Exceptional service, lovely room, best bed ever!",
From the moment we checked in  we were treated very professionally by all the staff. We ate at the main restaurant for lunch and breakfast which was good.

"Incredible staff! They genuinely make a huge effort to go the extra mile, such as check in and out- just amazing attention to detail. Wonderful location just behind Orchard Rd, walking distance but somehow you feel away from it all. The rooms are lovely with excellent large bathrooms and spacious powerful showers. Double sink etc. Nice gym and facilities. Clean. All I can say is I wish I could afford to stay here on my business trips every month in Singapore, its up there with St Regis for the best hotel in Singapore.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,pure quality,
My husband and I spent our 5th year anniversary in Singapore and we are glad that we chose to stay at the Four Seasons. The room we got was an executive suite and was on promo (3rd night free). After a long tiring day we always looked forward to going back to our hotel room because it was so relaxing....bed was very comfortable!!! We also loved the location because it was just a few minutes walk to Orchard Road. They even had a walkway from the hotel connecting to Hilton Orchard. I would have given it an excellent rating if they were able to accommodate our early check in and late check out. But it wasn't really their fault because the hotel was really fully booked.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,excellent service & great location,

"3 nights. The hotel is good, service very good from most of the staff.Rooms - good size and bathrm with separate shower, air con is quiet, bed is comfy. Housekeeping seem to be doing a good job. However windows need a clean. Coffee Shop staff really make effort to address guests by name. The b/fast spread is very good. 2 swimming pools in the hotel which is nice. We preferred the one on 3/f to do laps. The gym is average size, ticks all the boxes for equipment and it has windows! The BIG problem I had though was the amount of plastic bottles this hotel must use. OK the guests feel more comfortable with bottled water... but surely they could use glass bottles in the room or a water fountain option next to the ice machine maybe.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Comfortable Stay with plenty of plastic bottled water!!,
"Great location (3 minutes walk to Orchard road), very spacious room, excellent service, even the concierge staff was addressing us by our first names by the 2nd day, secluded (great privacy) and extremely comfortable beddings rivaled so far as far as I am concerned by the Ritz. The only downside is the pool areas (both on 3rd floor and on the roof top) are a bit dated and could do with a new look (but spotless clean).",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Exactly what you would expect from a Fourseasons hotel,
"I stayed here a while back, but I had to send a review of this place.  They go over and above to make you feel comfortable here.  I went here on a business trip, and just had the best stay.  They staff was very helpful, and spoke fluent English.  The room I had was impeccible and very clean.  It is close to the Orchard Shopping district and the MRT(Singapore's subway).  Even the hotel restaurant, which is usually just average at best, was a great place.  I was there over a Sunday, and they had a Sunday buffet, and it was great!",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Top shelf hotel,
"Visited Singapore to share a special birthday lunch with friends.

I would return just for the bread and butter pudding!",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Brunch Magic,
"The hotel is everything you would expect of the Four Seasons: comfort, location and absolute professionalism. We spent four nights here on leisure and had a wonderful stay. As always, it is the staff that make the difference - warm and friendly and extremely helpful. The physical appearance of the property itself is slightly dated compared to ultra modern new hotels, but still a high standard of amenity and cleanliness. Without a doubt one of Singapores finest. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,5 star staff,
"From the front door of the hotel straight to our room, we were treated very well. The service is excellent! With a complimentary drink on arrival and a free snack in our room. I also liked that they lay apples out on a table in the corridor so guests could take them and eat them. They also booked my tickets for the movie 'The Dark Knight Rises' at the local Imax close to the hotel and gave very detailed instructions on how to get there. The breakfast was also excellent with a variety of international and local asian cuisine. Overall a fantastic hotel! I had a lovely stay with my family and will definitely recommend this to anyone.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent hotel with great service!,
"Made my 4 year olds feel so welcome. The doorman and concierge were great and created a perfect stay. Only letdown was housekeeping but they were quick to react and amend.

The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, and the room service menu is excellent.  The pool area is also nice, you wouldn't think you were so close to Orchard Road. The pool staff are very attentive, however there isn't a pool bar so it does take a while for your drinks to arrive :-)",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Just what you would expect from the four seasons...,

"We stayed there for a few days in Singapore, a superior room with a comfy king bed on the 10th floor. We were satisfied with our room and services provided during our stay. The facilities are great for both business and leisure travellers.   The hotel staff were very nice, from lobby to housekeepers. It locates on the quieter side of Orchard Road, meaning a 10-min walk from hotel to Orchard MRT station and the big malls on Orchard Road. If there were taxis dropping off guests, there may be a short of taxis at front. Or the hotel staff were always nice to help call a cab for you.   The hotel is pretty close to the Biotanic Gardens - a fantastic park that we went one morning for a jog. You can catch a bus opposite the hotel, or it takes 10-15 mins walk.",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,A lovely hotel on the quieter side of busy Orchard district,
We stayed here for 2 nights in our 3days 2 nights trip to Singapre. We almost satisfied with the room here. They're very cleans and spacious.

"This is one of many stays with Four Seasons and were really impressed with the professional staff and service.  Our room was very comfortable and quite.  We loved the breakfast buffet.  The health club has all the cardio workout machines one could hope for and two pools to pick from for swimming in.  There was a charge for the internet throughout the entire property, but that is just the way these high end hotels operate unfortunately.  Large selection of channels on the television.  Will book it again if the opportunity arises again.  Dinner was really superb.  Didn't need to go outside the hotel for meals during our short visit.  The location was ideal for the shopping mall.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Very good hotel!,
"What can I say, again very solid performance from Four Seasons Singapore. Great service, excellent rooms, luxurious but still comfortable atmosphere. Very friendly staff, most of them remembering your name (I have a difficult Swedish name). Service on the roof top pool (Alison) is always warm.

This is a special place to stay and the location is great - at the end of Orchard Road, just minutes away from the main shopping area but yet a little removed and peaceful.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Another excellent stay,

It was nice to find a hotel that could make a teenager feel so welcome. We loved the easy walk to Orchard Road from the hotel and quick taxi ride to the restaurants at Dempsey Hill.

I found the four seasons in Singapore to be an excellent choice of hotel. The facilities were brilliant and the staff very helpful.  Being off the hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd was also a good choice. One down side is the fact that a number of larger and nicer hotels seems to be charging for Wifi access.. Surely at top prices this service could be free?. All in all highly recommended,5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent,

Cute little robes and amenities for my children.  Hotel is situated at a quieter side of Orchard road.  Away from the crowds but near to everything that orchard road has to offer in my humble opinion.  Extra points with toys provided at the rooftop swimming pool.  I believe having a swimming pool on the rooftop is something quite unique.,4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Staycation in town,
"Well located, The Four Seasons in Singapore feels like a boutique hotel with warm and friendly customer care. I particularly found the concierge team very helpful as they steered me in the right directions. Breakfast was good, the team in the main restaurant were great too - proactively finding me a magazine for my solo dinner visit. Only comment would be to warn guests that the best way back to the hotel is through the Hilton when coming from Orchard Road (despite the address for the Four Seasons being ON Orchard Road). Day one left the hotel in daylight and emerged from shopping after dark and couldn't find my hotel for the first time in my life!

We checked in at 8 am and they still accomodated us in the club lounge for breakfast and access to the club for showers/stam/sauna etc. and gave the room before 9 am even though check in is at 2 pm.

But the food is worth the wait.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Perfect,
"I stayed here for business (a conference) and the room was paid for by the conference organisers so the one thing I can't comment on is the room cost (although the bar menu showed that simple things like a glass of wine will set you back quite a bit!!). But the hotel is fabulous; brilliant service; fantastic breakfasts; very well appointed rooms ... and the bathroom - a real touch of luxury. Great location ... although most things in Singapore are within easy reach anyway. But a few days of pampering. Very enjoyable indeed!  And as an aside, the support for our conference, including catering etc, was very professional and very well done.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Absolutely the best,
"This hotel meets or exceeds every expectation for a five-star hotel anywhere in the world. .  Being a tourist I was pleased with the easy access to Orchard Road and once construction is complete, even easier to get in the MRT subway system.  Other hotels should study the Four Seasons to see how to get it right on every level.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,As good as it gets,
"We stayed here for the weekend, and were very happy with the room as well as the service. The hotel employees were helpful, courteous  and discreet. Even the staff from the housekeeping and room service departments were thoughtful and very considerate with requests, and in the manner they executed the same. The bed was extremely comfortable, the rooms kept clean, plus the design of  and furniture in the room are safe for our toddler. It was a short walk to Orchard road, and the area was very safe even at night.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Loved our stay,

"Ok ok ... 4 seasons hotels are a format ..... but what a format! yes the room decor was a little on the formal side by todays standards yet, yes, the service and facilities are ememplorary. If you have the budget this is a great place to stay and perfectly located for shopping sprees ... albeit in the luxury side of town ... orcahrd road. I,ll be back.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,ALL as can be expected,
"This is a wonderful hotel.    The rooms are large and luxurious.   The location is ideal, close to Orchard Road.    The service is impeccable.   I would specifically cite ""Edmund"" at the concierge desk who was extremely helpful in how to get around the city, what to be sure to see (we wanted to sightsee on our own), and in recommending restaurants.   The breakfast buffet has everything you could want.    The Chinese restaurant serves excellent food.  Highly recommended.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Four Seasons Hotel Singapore is A+ in every way,
"We had one night in SIN.  Took advantage of the weekend breakfast special.  Had a late night arrival from the US.  The staff was welcoming and warm.  The room was great, generous space and well-appointed.  The breakfast was good.  Nice pool. Good location on Orchard Road.  Wonderful friendly staff.",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,great experience,
"This is easily the best hotel in Singapore. Efficient staff, flawless and attentive service, best concierge in town, great fitness centre and tennis courts... the list just goes on and on. I stay here every single time I visit Singapore, and have never been disappointed.  The location on Orchard Blvd is ideal - it is much quieter than Orchard Road, but sacrifices very little in convenience and ease of access to it. The link to the Hilton Hotel (which is situated on Orchard Road) is a great added convenience in this respect. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Best hotel in Singapore - by a mile,
"We stayed here for 5 nights to attend a friend's wedding in the hotel. One of the best hotels I've stayed in Singapore. The staff were courteous, efficient and helpful. I receive a complimentary birthday cake by surprise. The pools were clean. Breakfast was good. Good location. Rooms spacious and luxurious. Absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended! ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Out of this world!,
"We stayed here on our way to and on the way back from Bali, great service, great food, all the usual 4 seasons touches, the Sunday Brunch is the best ever! If you are in Singapore on a sunday its a must ",4.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Great Brunch,
"Got a last minute room here as all of singapores hotels were packed due to some aerospace convention. Had a suite that was very spacious and up to the usual 4 seasons standards.  This hotel is very swish...the reception staff look sharp in their suits and have communication devices to keep in touch with other staff whilst on the move.   The spa is excellent with free use of jacuzzi, steam room, suana etc. Two great outdoor swimming pools (one at spa level - about level 10?)...and one right at the top of the hotel.  This hotel is located just off the top end of orchard road and is linked by a strip of designer clothes shops to the Hilton.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,Excellent Hotel,
"This is one of my favorite hotels.  I have been staying here since 1999 and just love it.  The rooms are luxurious.  The service is excellent.  The food is very good, especially the dim sum.  They have always gone out of their way to accommodate my special dietary needs. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,This is an excellent hotel,
"Wonderful staff (even though they forgot -- despite several e-mails -- that out four year old would be with us).  Great location for shopping, food, and mass transit.  Elegant and kid-friendly at the same time.  A great value for the money. ",5.0,Four Seasons Hotel,,,,"Perfect location, kid friendly",
