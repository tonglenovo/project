Disappointing service and stay,Travelloger2,"I was quite disappointed with our stay at the M.O. earlier this week. I checked out with relief that its over, just yesterday.   I booked an Ocean view Twin room for our family of four (two adults, two children). On checking in, we were directed to a King bedroom. I went downstairs to the lobby to ask them to correct this error. The receptionist issued a new keycard and we hauled our 5 suitcases and kids to the new room only to find that this was once again a King bed room. After that, I spent the whole day repeating my requests for a twin bed, which was acknowledged but ignored. We left the room twice for 2-4 hours to allow for the configuration change. Finally, at 8.55pm, the house manager called upon us and asked if everything was alright and that they were ready to change the beds to a twin configuration. It was of course far too late to change anything. My older one was asleep on the chair and younger one had already slept in the kingbed. Our sleeping arrangement was needlessly interrupted.   Other signs of poor service showed up when:   - the room was not cleaned at all on our second day. Used Towels were left the way it was in the bathtub, kingbed lay unamde. We called housekeeping to request for cleaning. Again, acknowledged but ignored.   - I voiced out my disappointment to the receptionist on their WhatsApp. They did not have the sincerity or courtesy to apologise for their negligence. They sent the housekeeping to address the twin bed configuration issue at night, at a late hour but by then honestly, I didn't want to deal with the change + my children being fast asleep.   Feeling ignored, and forgotten as a guest is perhaps the worst feeling while on holiday. I rather regretted choosing this hotel.   I would rate the service is there was one. There are many service providers ,but little service.   Two plus points about the hotel: The breakfast buffet and the location. But I could have done better research and picked literally any other hotel around the Marina area and had a better holiday experience that guarantees two basic requirements: sleep and responsiveness.   Mandarin Oriental Singapore is definitely a hard pass. We have absolutely no desire to return to this hotel. No longer a ""fan"" of M.O.…",2,October 2022,
Centrally located amazing Hotel,Ankit B,"Stayed for 5 nights with family. Plus points - 1. Location - Centrally located, we could walk up to the Marina Sands Bay, Gardens of the Bay, Singapore flyer or the Merlion. The Hotel is also connected to the 2 large Malls. Airport was about a 20 min drive. 2. Room - Fully carpeted with floor to ceiling window. We had booked a city view room. Would highly recommend booking Sea facing room. 3. Service - Great staff. We requested a stroller for our kid and the same got arranged. The hotel allowed delivery of food ordered online. 4. Breakfast spread was amazing. Overall an amazing stay. Will come back.",5,May 2022,
Simply the Best,Gracie2010,"I cannot wait to go back. Plain and simple. The hotel ticks every box and even more. Booking a club room was definitely cherry on top.   Our room had the most amazing view of Marina Bay! The room itself is spacious and the bathroom was huge.  The offering of breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks at the club lounge was worth every penny! The staff were so gracious and helpful we couldn't help feeling sad by the time we left!",5,September 2022,
Exceptional service,Duncan707,"Stayed here for the F1.  Check in smooth and detailed. Room clean and good size with an absolutely phenomenal view.  Bathroom - shower was very small and the water temp fluctuated slightly every 30-60 seconds. That is my only grope - we moved from here to Shangri-La and it was an inferior hotel in every way except one as the shower was much larger and consistent.   Pool area - amazing. Iced water, mango sorbet, cooling leg spray, sunscreen - all complimentary and service was top notch.   Breakfast - brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.   Expensive",4,October 2022,
Great location,Andy S,"Just spent 3 days here, prior to F1 so a little busy.  Check in was quick and efficient.  Hotel lobby is very dark and dated and not a very welcoming entrance.  Almost identical to the Pan Pacific. Rooms were well fitted and pleasant, we were upgraded to a sea view, WOW what a view, the singapore flyer, gardens by the bay, marina Bay sands all in view, absolutely stunning. Pool was fantastic, personal service, small treats through out the day, iced water, frozen fruit, ice lolly handed out for, lovely touch.  Towels placed on sunbeds for you.  Lovely staff around the pool. Location for Marina Bay is fantastic, everything is nearby, one of the best locations in Singapore. Breakfast was one of the best Singapore offers, also with Al Fresco dining, great staff, attentive and pleasant.  Really felt special and treated with kindness.  Thank you Pauline (chef) for making my pancakes extra special. Highly rate this hotel, but the lobby is a let down being dark and un inviting. Always love the M.O. Hotels, having stayed in K. L. as well, just as good. We are certainly Fans of M.O. Well done to all staff…",5,October 2022,Travelled as a couple
"Stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",GK,"We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights in May '22. We had booked into the City Suite and when we reached the hotel around noon to check in, we were told the room wouldn't be ready for another few hours, and we were given a base category room to freshen up. But the room was ready only around 6 pm, which was okay with us since were out exploring the city till late evening. When we did enter our room, we found that the AC vents in the room were very unclean, and the room carried a musty odour. This was around 10.30 pm, and we were completely exhausted. It took more than one call to get someone to come to the room and attend to my complaint. A few more minutes later, thankfully, a slightly senior member of their management team turned up and attended to our concerns, and was able to offer a better room. I believe her name is Maggie/Margaret. She was definitely understanding and even ended up upgrading us to a Bay View Suite, which we really appreciated. Maggie (I really hope thats her name - I had written it down somewhere but dont have that slip anymore) salvaged the situation.  As for the rest of our stay, the breakfast spread is good, and offers a decent selection for everyone. What does bother me - and this is not particular to one hotel - is the limited selection for vegetarians. My wife and I are practicing vegetarians and therefore find it a little difficult to spot a buffet that has enough options for vegetarians. The Mandarin breakfast was nice, but not exceptional, as we hoped it would be.  Another thing, and this is pretty important to me, I wanted to point out is the mattresses. We woke up with a sore back every morning because the mattresses were just not right. We are not very picky about these things usually, but this time we had to highlight this. This is usually a sign of the property ageing and the management not giving it enough attention. I hope something is done about it.   Overall, a decent stay, and I may consider another stay if the rates are competitive. Let's see.…",4,May 2022,

Nothing less than Exceptional,Cols71,"My cousin and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel for 5 nights and was blown away by the service and hospitality of the staff. We stayed in a Marina View room which did not disappoint and I looked forward to going back to the view every night.  Every morning and evening it was such a pleasure coming to the reception area, as the stuff were so welcoming. Thank you to ALL the staff at, we had an AMAZING STAY.",5,August 2022,
5 star hotel that is far away from being luxurious,Leonie E,"We already stayed in many MO hotels over the world but this one purely lives off the reputation of the chain name. Rooms look shabby and unrefurbished and give the feeling of a 3 star hotel but the price per night is very expensive. The service was very not up to standard, the room was cleaned poorly and drilling works at 12 o’clock at night were the cherry on top. The first night we had a fish that was super smelly and we couldn’t eat it and went to bed hungry. The room doesn’t even have a coffee machine, there’s only a water kettle and a sachet of instant powder. Really nothing is right about this hotel except the view. Whenever we complained we just received a shy sorry. Such a rip off this place, wow!",1,September 2022,Travelled on business
Annual Office  Lunch,Mystices,"Had a very successful annual office luncheon today. The senior manager of the event management, Roger is very accommodating to all our reasonable requests from day one to the day itself.. The operational manager Daniel, on the day itself was just as helpful and even make last minute adjustments to our table arrangements which we were very thankful.  Feedback on food was good and more than sufficient. The fish was fresh and the desserts not too sweet.  This is the type of service we would not hesitate to return in future. The staff made everything so smooth and easy for their guests. Also not forgetting those in the kitchen and service staff - A Big thank you!

"Amazing views, perfect location - highly recommend",Lorna P,Absolutely stunning views from this hotel of the marina.  We stayed with family and were in rooms on the 10th and 7th floor. The rooms were very spacious and had everything you needed and comfy beds and pillows.  Room service was brilliant and the food was top notch.  Plenty of room at the swimming pool and again amazing views.  Perfectly situated to get around.  We were greeted with cold cans of water and towels on our arrival back from a run early one morning which really was a great touch.   Would highly recommend staying at this hotel.,5,September 2022,

Unbelievable service and amenities at a fantastic location,TravellingLee2022,"We spent 5 nights at the MO Singapore for the last part of our honeymoon. Our experience was nothing but spectacular from the first moment.   We were picked up at Changi airport by our hotel driver Ivan, who gave us all the local and insider information on what to see and where to go: from best Hawker Food Centers to best attractions.   When we arrived at the hotel, we were met by Katya, who rushed us to our room for the check-in process, where she spent time with us to explain everything about the hotel and give us more hints and tips about Singapore. As the hotel were aware of this being our honeymoon it was very nice that house keeping had made the additional effort to leave us a surprise in the room.

Great hospitality and thoughtfulness towards guests,Takeo Segawa,"On a family trip from Japan, when my wife's PCR tested positive and it was difficult to return home, Mandarin Oriental cared for my wife with a warm letter and a gift. In addition, the hotel sent a technician to my wife's isolated room for another PCR, which came back negative and allowed her to return to Japan. For travelers, the hotel is far more dependable than the embassy, and I have the greatest respect for their dedication and hospitality.",5,August 2022,
Six Star International Hotel,GB,"This is a five star plus international hotel. Luxurious, clean, well appointed and well maintained rooms, common areas and amenities. Views over bay from guest rooms and pool are magnificent. Staff are extremely professional and friendly. Stayed here with wife and three children  (ages 10, 12, and 13) for three nights in late August 2022. Eight superb breakfast buffet stations. All restaurants five star for food and service (Steakhouse, Japanese, Chinese and Italian). Bars are top notch with great vibe. Special thanks to Katja from Guest Services for making stay wholly memorable. I rate this hotel up there with the Trump International Hotel, New York, and the Four Seasons Hotel, Hong Kong.

Perfect for business,Marcus D,"The MO is in a great location, just a quick walk from Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens. It's also just a short taxi ride in to town.   My room was impeccably clean, a good size and very comfortable. I even had a view of the pool and Marina Bay Sands.   The staff were helpful and polite, and the attention to details in the way in which my room was serviced was amazing - they even tidied my phone cables with MO branded cable ties.

Not up to it,listenwell,"I am a fan, so I do stay a lot at the MOs, and also ranked top tier among the fans.   This hotel in Singapore is not up to it. Dated interior, understaffed, and service people seemed to be in training. Unruly kids were permitted to chase each other screeching and screaming in the echo chamber of the atrium. One could hear them 10 levels apart as if one be on a playground. None of the staff made an effort to tell the adoring parents that their kids' riot is not music to their peoples ears.   After my booking expired I switched hotels to stay elsewhere for 10 days, and for sure I will never return.",1,April 2022,Travelled on business

I am *not a fan of the MO Singapore,xfest,"This hotel is three stars for the rooms and five stars for the staff.  The hotel is in need of a face lift. A quick search shows it hasn’t been updated since the mid 2000s and it shows.   The standard rooms are small. The AC is loud. The light switches don’t make any sense. (I am in a city view suite and there are three different master switches that control three different but sometimes overlapping areas).   I upgraded from a lower floor ocean view room that is one of the standard rooms to a city suite. Let me make remarks on both:  The standard rooms are small. On the lower floors, you can hear all of the activity of the restaurant in the atrium seep through the doors. If you’re sensitive to noise, request a much higher floor.

"A nice hotel with great staff, very nice pool and excellent breakfast.",AussieHrvat,"My ratings are a bit harsh, so 4 over 5 is not a terrible reflection.  I booked three rooms for a family trip from overseas.  One city suite, one city deluxe, marina buy view room.  Arrival and check in was fine,  the from desk staff are excellent - polite, helpful, and sort queries out.  The hotel has the appearance of its late 1980s build date but is clean and renovated I believe 20 years ago.  Our suite was to accomodate my wife and I, and three small kids.  Our first suite had two singles, and two foldaways -- a mix up and odd configuration. They fixed it but we slept in this room one night.  The night staff were great and came and got the foldout beds (which are comfortable for a 14 year old) and a couch was made up for our young one.  The city views are not that great to…",4,July 2022,
(Almost) A Great Stay at Mandarin Oriental,IceBear,"We enjoyed our staycation at MO ). Staff were friendly and helpful.  Have welcome snacks in the room.  We were able to seek assistance from hotel via whatsapp if needed.  Our City Suite (#2027) was spacious and 4 beds (2 were portable) are comfortable. Can see hotel is earth friendly by giving water in glass bottles and shampoo/bath foam in dispensers. Breakfast is delicious and swimming pool is great.  Love it that there is no need to book timings for breakfast and swimming pool.  Accessible to nearby shopping malls.  Only small issue was the heater in our room, hard to operate as it is not intuitive.  Water took forever to be warm, then would become overly hot, then cold after adjustment. Was unable to enjoy a proper bath. An engineer came to fix but the issue still persisted.…",4,June 2022,
Luxury like only Singapore delivers,JenniferonTour,"Perhaps it was because the breakfast host remembered our names and greeted us like she was so happy to see us.  The breakfast was perfect.  The view was legendary.  Could be the location.  MO was 5 star.  There are only 4 hotels to choose from: Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton, Pan Pacific and MO.  Everything else is too far away, too close to the shops or too busy.  MO is a great choice.  Some small foibles.  COVID has left hotels empty and a bit musty.  Some equipment not working.  All requiring patience as we all re-build.  The new complexity is cash.  CR Card has a charge on top of the charge sometimes and in no discernible pattern.  Consider WePay or ApplePay or cash.

A Breathtaking View Of The Marina Bay & The Fireworks!,Nurhakeem,"When booking the hotel room, I indicated that I wanted to have a good view of the fireworks from the NDP rehearsal. The staff emailed us suggesting to get a room with Marina Bay View instead of Ocean view. I appreciate the proactiveness of the staff. We had a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay & the fireworks!   Also, when we entered the room, they left us wine/champagne & some kuih. We can't consume it so we called the staff to have it back. We didn't expect them to apologise and replace it with chilled orange juice.  Also, even though the restaurant do not have halal option, there are many halal certified restaurants and fast food outlet at Marina Square just beside the hotel. It's very convenient.",5,July 2022,

A perfect balance of efficiency, warmth, a “let’s make this happen for you” attitude and also being accomodating to our particular requests (eg food allergies). There were also many changes with regards to covid restrictions through the planning process and we were able to navigate through all that with her.

Swish hotel with great views and breakfast,MonsieurPompidou,"We spent three nights at the Mandarin Oriental to begin our honeymoon. The hotel’s atmosphere was quiet and understated, and the guests appeared to be split more or less evenly between tourists and business customers. The main lobby/atrium is spectacular, with six lifts in a central column rising to the floors above. Every room is accessed via a balcony – while perfectly safe, as someone with a fear of heights I found it a bit difficult.  We took a marina bay view room, which had an incredible outlook across the marina to the skyscrapers beyond. The room was clean and in good condition, although the décor was perhaps starting to feel a touch dated. The bathroom likewise.

Great place for family. Best 5 Star Hotel Service in Singapore,Ace Y,"Due to the pandemic, my family has tried staycations in most of the top hotels in Singapore and by far, Mandarin Oriental is at the top in terms of quality of stay and service.   The Marina Bay Suite is such a nice room for a family staycation. Everything about this hotel is 5 Stars! The staff are polite and helpful. Check in and check out was a breeze. Being a fan of M.O has great perks. The interior design and architecture of this hotel is Insta-worthy. The pool is great for both adults and kids.

Awesome hotel with a superb view and breakfast!,Yewt,"The room was spacious and the hotel staff were very friendly. We were taken aback by the splendid view when we entered the room. They even prepared us some drink and cake for our anniversary stay. Some points to note was that you would have to get some time to be used to their switches, not immediately intuitive. The views at the swimming pool were also fabulous although you have to book a slot in advance and be punctual to enjoy the session fully! The hotel breakfast was a buffet where we could walk around to request our choice of food, a very pleasant memory from the past which we had been accustomed with before Covid. Another thing to note is that the transfer to and from the carpark is not so easy. The hotel is not the newest but our stay was a beautiful moment to keep for…",5,December 2021,

Magical Mandarin Oriental Wedding Banquet,Alex D,"Held our Wedding Banquet at Mandarin Oriental Ballroom in Nov 2021. Highly recommending for any couples who are considering this hotel.  We had our banquet booked amongst the ever changing government rules with number of pax, what we could do, what we could not do which certainly made the planning of logistics an absolute nightmare.   We were greeted by Juliana as our event manager. One of the nicest and cheery event managers we’ve ever come across. Given the changing rules, we were in doubt around many many aspects of the wedding which then led to further questions to Juliana. She was very patient and attentive throughout the planning phase and helped to answer all our queries to alleviate any doubts. There was a last minute change to our tables few hours before the wedding and…",5,November 2021,

Wedding Lunch banquet (Garden Suite),Gene,"Our wedding banquet planning lasted more than 2 years due to Covid. Throughout this entire period Mandarin Oriental Singapore readily stood by us. Over the 2 years plus, there were changes in Event Management managers in charge, however, the transition was quite smooth without much disruptions. The Event Management managers, Zann, Timothy and Juliana were very professional.

They would ask if i was ready for the next course before taking out from the warmer. Jegan even reminded me i could go have some food first, and that could help them with the photo-taking…   Alice reminded the bride to at least warm her stomach with some soup in case she needs to drink alcohol later… when i couldnt find the bride’s phone she had a team of people search for it, even under the stage!

Utterly disappointed.,EENNOVY,"Due to covid, travel is hard and hence our family decided to book a staycation with our SRV vouchers. And also because of covid, hotel and tourism took a hit. Hence MO had a pretty decent deal. We decided to book it using our SRV vouchers. However, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the hotel was designated to be an Shn hotel and our hotel stay was canceled just like that. No apologies no compensation. After much fuss, they finally agreed to give me a ""good"" deal for 2022. Which I didn't think was a good deal as its still more expensive than what we originally paid for. I'm totally utterly disappointed by the hotel. We had wanted to boost their hotel sales and booked with them but they decided the shn deals from govt is better and decided to forego future biz and not valuing…",1,November 2021,

Wedding reception at Mandarin Oriental Ballroom on 24th October 2021,Cheng C,It’s been a while since I attended a wedding dinner due to the ongoing Covid situation.

Number of pax was limited to 5 per table and naturally the table size is smaller to fit just 5. Checking in was fuss free and very efficient. Guests were seated in 4 separate zones and no inter mingling between zones or tables within the same zone is allowed (which is fine and in fact the right thing to do).

Water was refilled without asking and used plates were cleared away very quickly too. Albert and Jane were very friendly and engaging, thank you for their great service.

Disappointed stay,Tatsuo M,"I stayed at MO Singapore in August to celebrate my partner's birthday. Overall I was very disappointed at the hotel/service level.  Pros  1) Upgraded from Bay View Suite to Bay Suite - should be better room even though it was lower floor - 7th 2) Great hardware in Bay suite - especially TOTO washlet 3) Room service - quite good quality of dinner, steak was amazing.  It was in the phase 2 then - we were not able to dine out at all.   Cons 1) Phone in the living room - no indication of phone numbers to connect, such as room service. even Room service menu book does not say any numbers. Operator told us to check the main phone in the bedroom. It is inconvenient.  2) Poor celebratory treat (birthday) as a MO Member - small cake and some Singapore traditional confectionary were…",3,August 2021,

Weekend lunch,Low,"Was served by CK, Ganesan and Alai team on the 21st Aug for weekend lunch. Their services was great and the staffs were all very friendly and easy to talk too. Instead of collecting our own food, the chef will plate our order at their respective station. Food was well worth the money paid for as it was way better than average. Buffet lunch starts from 12pm - 230pm. Arrive at about 12.10pm and was full just before 2pm, sufficient time to eat despite heavy crowd on a weekend.",4,August 2021,

Slightly tired-looking decor but excellent service,ianwyj,"I stayed here as the third of a four-part hotel-hopping staycation.  There was a strong emphasis on contact tracing and hand hygiene at the lobby when I arrived.  Excellent attentive customer service was noted at check-in with staff welcoming me with courtesy and carefully explaining the various restrictions that were in place.  That settled, I was upgraded to a room on one of the highest floors which was a nice touch.    My room was certainly a significant step up compared than the one at the hotel that I had previously been staying in.  It had a good view of the Marina Bay area, which was  especially lovely at night when viewed with all the lights turned off in the room.  On the topic of lighting, the room was actually very dim when all of the ceiling lights were on, and I…",4,December 2020,

Family stay at Mandarin Oriental,Jesse,"Went for a 3D2N family staycation during National Day long weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The room is clean and spacious. Service by all staff is impeccable. As it was heightened alert, we can order our breakfast and was delivered to our room. As we are vegetarian, we had requested for vegetarian breakfast but with no alliums but we were served noodles with alliums and also sausage! We had been more specific the following morning but the fried noodles still smell of garlic. Hope that the hotel will be more sensitive towards vegetarian diet of different requirements as we are Buddhists.  Overall, the stay was fantastic and one of the best family hotels that we have stayed in Singapore.",4,August 2021,
4D3N Staycation + Birthday Celebration!,Mahathir Halim,"This is my first stay with Mandarin Oriental and I have to say my wife and I are delighted with the professionalism and friendliness catered to us from the moment we step foot into the building to the day we checked out. Every staff here treats you with utmost respect and greets you well every time they chance upon you, no matter what service they work in.  MO is now my top rated hotel for customer service in SG. My email liaising with them were smooth. All communications were very clear to me via email on what to expect and do amidst the Covid restrictions.  Booked the swimming pool facilities ahead of time due to Covid restrictions and everything went as planned. MO provided a small birthday surprise gift for my wife when we checked into the room. Great!  We were also afforded…",5,August 2021,
Amazing service in spite of Covid restrictions.,gykung,"Dining out was not allowed due to covid restrictions… but we were able to place orders for breakfast (included in our package) and have an excellent breakfast spread served in-room:) Kudos to the team at Mandarin Oriental for maintaining the 5-star service levels in spite of covid restrictions. A little dim sum was presented to us during tea time on our first afternoon, and slice of cake was presented to us on the second evening (for a family occasion).  One minor observation was that the bathtub’s hot water supply seems much cooler than the hot water supply at the shower - we bathed in 100% “hot water”.",5,August 2021,
"Grand old dame, one of the best in service in the industry",Chris L,"Among the top-tier luxury hotels in Singapore, this is one grand old dame. Last renovated 17 years ago in 2004, the hotel still exudes an air of effortless elegance that belies its age. It is an understated luxury that is not ostentatious, against the trend of light-filled lobbies that make you feel like you're passing through an airport. The focus is on you, and only you.   The staff is always willing to go an extra mile for you to make you feel at home. It's more polished and heartfelt than other luxury hotels in the area.  Examples: 1. As we were dining in our room during P2HA period, the hotel offered to microwave our takeaway meals for us (after we signed an indemnity form) 2. We were celebrating a birthday and they prepared a cake good for 2 for us.  3. Turn down service…",5,August 2021,
Not living to the 5-stars standards,edith lin,"Having a much needed staycation during the midst of heightened alert for pandemic. Price for Marina Bay view room sky-rocketed before the announcement for NDP '21 was postponed, but we managed secured 1 room for our anniversary celebration still. After the annonucement, went to check with the Hotel if there will be any benefit-in-kind in view of the change in NDP. (I was actually hoping M.O would be able to throw in some little perks). At first, they offered me to change date without charges - I took it, but they replied saying that they cannot honour the promise given that they will be converted to SHN facilities. Understood, so ask if there is anything they can do for me, as simple as throwing a meal. Answer is No. Because I am not entitled to having a meal since I booked…",3,August 2021,

National Day staycation,trvkaki,"After our Easter stay, we are back at MO for another stay on the eve of National Day. Due to the rescheduling of the National Day performance till 21 Aug, a ceremonial parade was held on the morning of National Day instead and as a result it became a bonus for us as we were able to sight the floating platform from our room.  MO service continues to be top notch but the front desk staff appeared to be overwhelmed and less service orientated as compared to our previous stay.  While the bedroom is in need of serious refurbishment, it was kept clean and comfortable. The button of the toilet bowl flush probably needs a fixing as it was tough to push down.  It was another great stay at MO and I understand that MO will be supporting the stay home notice scheme and will be closed to the…",5,August 2021,

We haven’t seen each other in 4 months as he lives in Brunei and we’ve been in a long distance relationship for almost 2 years since covid happened.   He booked a Marina Bay view room on the 19th floor. It was my first time staying at MO. I was surprised with a birthday cake, champagne, wine, balloons and hand-written cards for my birthday!   The 90-minute oriental massage was so relaxing I pretty much fell asleep for most of it. I could easily spend an entire afternoon at The Spa. They even wished me happy birthday and gave me a small gift after the massage.

No hassle involved and Lizbeth kindly arranged for some surprises from the Hotel that truly made our stay extra memorable. This was on top of the regular welcome amenity of chocolates and Taiwanese pineapple tarts that were delicious!  We were assisted by Felicia during check-in and her bubbly demeanour lifted our spirits, even extending a 6pm late check-out to us which was perfect because we really didn’t want our stay to end. There was no issue with our key cards accessing our rooms after the original 12 noon checkout, saving us the hassle of resetting our key cards at front desk.

The room was a little small and underwhelming for the high cost.,3,November 2020,
Great experience at MO on my birthday,Sheryl,The room view was as promised (Marina bay view) and the size of the room was spacious making it very comfortable. There’s a nice corner to work if you need to. Was a stay for my birthday and MO never disappoints. They prepared decorations not just for the birthday girl but also prepared decorations for my baby girl. They were generous with time of stay (early check in late check out) and even gave complimentary cakes on two days for my birthday. Room condition is well maintained and clean.

Fantastic service,Wayne,"I’ve just completed an amazing one night stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore. I booked the stay and dine in package which includes an 11am check in, 6pm check out, dinner and breakfast.   The five star service began even before check in when I received a WhatsApp message from the hotel at 11:19am, informing/ reminding me that my room was ready for check in.   I was originally booked in a Marina Bay view room because I wanted to catch the National Day preview fireworks. However, with phase 2 heightened alert kicking in, the postponement of the National Day parade and the need to consume all of our meals in room, I enquired at check in about the possibility of upgrading my room at a cost.

But, dayummm, the food from MO Bar was amazing, you won’t even feel like u were doing a dine in. And, the staff upgraded us to ocean view room which had amazing view. The staffs were al really pleasant. I have nothing to complain. I do have a suggestion that maybe breakfast portion should be clearer cos it was a little small in my opinion.",5,July 2021,
Good service but dated,Kenji,"Among the Mandarin Oriental properties this one is somewhere between average to below average mostly due to the age of the property. The room has a great view and the hotel is easily accessible but the pool, gym and furnitures are all a bit dated compared to newer hotels. Update needed. Service was top notch as expected.",4,December 2020,
Fantastic staycation,Dileep Kumar D,No words to express our staycation.  Fantastic hotel. Friendly staffs  . Good breakfast and epicure dinner.

Great wedding banquet and bridal suite,TongChangYi,Chose to sign with mandarin oriental to hold my banquet. And it did not disappoint. Great wedding banquet and even better reception service throughout the event. Kudos to all the wedding staff and organisers who helped planned this wedding a success. Shoutout to justina who was my planning organiser for the event. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking to plan a wedding banquet during this pandemic.,5,July 2021,
Gd stay but their communication needs to improved.,gayathri,"Celebrated my hubby’s birthday at MO. Had a wonderful time. Everything was okay except the last day during checkout. The front desk staff had not billed us for our room service dinner. I had told them to include accordingly. After which I made the payment and left. After a week, the hotel emailed me that I did not pay for the room service dinner and happily went to double deduct my credit card for payment. Quite disappointed. Seems like there is no proper communication btw the staff.",4,June 2021,
Lovely Staycation!,Jasmine C,"We went on 24 July to celebrate my husband’s birthday. From the check-in to the check-out, the service by every staff we met was great. They go out of the way to make our stay a comfortable one. We were provided with coffee machine when we requested and I appreciate the fresh orange juice we requested and received for breakfast. Love the nasi lemak for breakfast. Love the smell of the toiletries, I requested for one more lotion and was provided for. Love the little touches such as the birthday balloons, envelopes for my kids with their names and the cake. The complimentary photography was great as well and we had such a good laugh. Walking distance to Marina Square n also Esplanade. Though gym not open I love the run. Also the beautiful sunrise and convenient to order food from…",5,July 2021,
Heartwarming birthday staycation,Rebecca T,"My family of 2 adults, 3 children booked a 1-night package ""Suite Moments"" to celebrate my daughter's 10th birthday. We were given a City Suite on the 21st floor.  Even before our stay, we already felt welcomed through the various prompt email exchanges with the hotel. In this pandemic, the many 5 star hotels that we have stayed in fell short in this area. Many were uncontactable and even when attended to, the staff sounded tired. But Mandarin Oriental stands out! Communication was always prompt and even before we asked, they took the initiative to keep in touch and ensured we know what's coming up.  Before check-in, we received a text that our room was ready! How reassuring is that?! Never got this from anywhere, and we know it would not be chaos at the check in counter (it was…",5,July 2021,

Check in was fast and easy .Front desk agent Miss Jessica was friendly and accommodating.Gave us a high floor to catch the great view and a late check out for the next day. Room was comfy and spacious.The view  overlooking the Marina Bay Area was awesome.A pity that the fireworks was cancelled.,5,July 2021,
Memorable staycation with amazing views,Globalfilmmaker,We were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary and my husband's birthday and so wanted to stay some place special. Mandarin Oriental is truly one of the best hotels in Singapore. We requested an upgrade for our Fans of MO perk and got a very nice view of the Singapore Flyer from the 20th floor. We had a package that included in room dinner and early check-in and late check out. The pool was really something special and the breakfast was huge - the hotel caters well to vegetarians. We look forward to returning when the club lounge is open.,5,July 2021,
5 star staycation experience!,Soon Joo K,"I booked an ocean view room at Mandarin Oriental Hotel last week for an overnight staycation cum birthday celebration.  From the moment we stepped into the hotel, all the arrangements were perfect.  Receptionist was friendly and helpful in clearing our enquiries, while in room dining team was thoughtful for our needs.  Even the support staff like pool and gym staff were attentive to our needs and offered to render us good service while we were at the pool and gym respectively.  The Ocean View room was magnificent and we never got tired of the view, especially at night time when we could see the vast ocean and ships in the horizon.  As our package included an indoor dinner set, we had Cherry Garden Chinese Food for our dinner. Splendid, as we prefer eating Chinese food.  The…",5,July 2021,

"Impeccable service, comfortable stay",ashlynne,"Was greeted with excellent service by Andrew at the front desk upon checking in. He was exceptionally observant and offered us with great perks to enhance our stay at the hotel. It was very proactive of him; he even offered to keep the cake I had in their kitchen since it wouldn’t fit the fridge in our room; really appreciated that.  When  I requested to extend my stay for an extra night, Rashidah was really helpful and helped me to coordinate with the front desk to carry forward my late checkout request to the next day. The staff I spoke to before at room reservation, before I spoke to Rashidah, simply said that she couldn’t guarantee if my late checkout request can be carried forward, and that I’d have to check with the concierge myself.  Finally, the staff near the entrance…",5,June 2021,
Service de Luxe @ Mandarin Oriental,Edvl17,"July must be my most special month to indulge- overseas travel, shopping and the likes. However, since the pandemic began, my usual plans to splurge had to adjust as well. What better way to do it ( in the absence of overseas travel and tourism) but to staycay in  5-star hotel! Before I checked-in at MO, I have already spent few days in another amazing nearby hotel , which provides a great way to compare ( in a good way). Both are equally at par but what sets MO apart is the super early check-in and super late checkout (keep in mind that this is of course, depending on the room availability). There was a really nice complimentary bottles of sparkling fruity beverage that has a perfect blend. The bath essentials by Diptyque set a greater experience when taking a shower. And…",5,July 2021,

Best staycation for the family,Daryl,"Had the best time with my family at Mandarin Oriental Singapore  Check in was a breeze and we were pleasantly greeted with a kid’s teepee and balloons in our room! Needless to say, our 3-year old kid was ecstatic and even napped in it.   Location is extremely convenient. Wife and I were spoiled for choice with many of the big malls within walking distance.  We had a great view of the floating platform from the room and caught a glimpse of the rehearsals happening on Saturday. I can only imagine the fantastic view on National Day itself!   All in all one of the best staycations we’ve had in Singapore and would highly recommend to families and couples.

Staycation at MO,Aly,"We had such a lovely time here. Welcomed by friendly staff :)  The room was spacious & clean, we had an amazing full bay view & managed to catch a glimpse of the NDP rehearsal at dinner time, which was really nice.  Gym facilities were good and the pool had a beautiful city view, really relaxing area.   Our in room dinner was one of the best experiences! Every single dish we had was so good and so made with effort. Really yummy desserts & unique cocktails.

Their service is excellent. When I told them that I planned a staycation for a break from work, they were nice enough to give me a room with a good view and also decorated the room. Their food is also fantastic. It's right next to Marina Square. It's also a walking distance from Suntec as well. Definitely coming back here again.

They even went the extra mile to decorate the room with balloons for our little one's birthday celebration, not to mention a super yummy cake.   Every corner was filled with personalised messages for me & my family, from little things like Care Packs, to a set of cute little pink slippers for my littlest one.  Our staycation was exceptional, smooth and without reason for worry.  Even the pull out bed which we request was set up in our room only just before dinner, so there was enough space for us to finish taking pictures around the hotel room first :D   MO is a hotel that really thinks for its guests, and care enough to make sure their guests fall into the rhythm of…",5,July 2021,

Prior to arrival , I had wrote to the hotel to check if they could arrange a complimentary cake as it was my mum’s birthday and Jarrod from reservations team was quick to reply to my email. He was able to arrange a petite cake.  On check in day , I arrived early at 11am and the lady named Shannon from front desk was prompt and super fast. No hassles. She was very informative as well and gave us all the info needed such as how to book breakfast timing and book a slot for the pool .To my pleasant surprise , she informed me that the room was ready and  I could check in.

Bad  (Wedding reception),Adeline,"My husband and I would like to express our disappointment of holding our wedding at MO back in April 2021. We had signed with the hotel because of its reputable services and cuisine but this is a contrast with how things were being managed during our banquet reception. We experienced a change of three different coordinators within a span two months and that was two months before our wedding day. What was the most exaggerating was a change in the coordinator just three days before the wedding day. I was only informed through my husband even though there was a group chat with that coordinator, my husband and myself. There were also other things that the team did not manage well.   1.

Pleasant Encounter @ Mandarin Oriental Hotel,Justin Teo,"Dear Mandarin Oriental management and staff,   Covid has been with us for quite a while that sometimes having the thought of going for a staycation at Singapore Hotels could at times be perceived as not worthwhile. That was my mindset before I set foot on Mandarin Oriental Hotel on a faithful night.   My family and I went on a night cycling venture from our place of residence to the Marina Bay Area, just to have a glimpse of night skyline. It was also with the hope that we could also cycle back home right after that. To set the context, I brought along my three children (all turning to age 5; 7 and 9 this year). Which meant there was also a possibility that my youngest may go ‘boneless’ and refuse to cycle back home when upon reaching the Marina Bay Area.   We set off and…",5,July 2021,

Thanks to Ian Soh for the room upgrade, complimentary birthday treat (cake and wine) and the birthday decoration to make it a memorable birthday celebration for us. Really appreciated. You made our stay memorable.   Our stay at Ocean Grand King was really great in every aspect, especially the bed and pillows are soft yet firm to make us sleep tight. Complimentary 2 bottles of sparkling flavoured water, face masks and a bottle of sanitizer. Definitely will come back again.",5,June 2021,
Home away from home,Emmanuel,"Mandarin Oriental's good service began even before we checked into the hotel. Julia helped me to weigh the pros and cons of various deals and suggested what would be the most value-for-money for my family of five. During the stay itself, we had impeccable service: our various housekeeping requests were always met and food came punctually despite them having to serve us in the room. By the end of the staycation, the children were reluctant to leave and said it was 'like home away from home'. We can't wait for another opportunity to stay with Mandarin Oriental again. Thank you, again, for the great stay and your warm hospitality. It made our stay extra special.",5,June 2021,
Birthday Weekend,Farah F,"Best weekend I’ve had in a long time! Felt so relaxed & recharged after a 3D2N stay.

Refreshing change from Marriot Group,Edwin K,"I have been a Platinum Elite member at Marriot for years. Due to the rewards system in place, I haven been exploring hotels in a while. This time because of an Amex promotion, who got to stay in Mandarin Oriental, and yes it brings back memories  of what service level should be. We are not any member of MO at all, instead you can categorise us as just a normal customer and yet the service and attention throughout our short stay here is incredible.  First the turn down service, whereby the staff placed the room slippers beside the bed. Such a normal turn down service in a 5 star hotels ,have been lacking in other brands.  Second,  a normal well organised  buffet spread in times like this. Really deserve the recognition n applause. Whilst other 5 star chain hotels uses this period…",5,June 2021,

"Amazing staycation, wonderful team at MO!",Charlene T,"This was a staycation for Father's Day celebration (19-20 June) and I stayed in a premiere room. I booked directly with the hotel website and joined as a ""fan of M.O."" - it has been a wonderful experience since then. Special shoutout to Christian the hotel manager, Shabana & Jarrod (reservation executives) who were super helpful and helped made my reservation process and requests such a smooth one, even after postponing once due to the Heightened Alert. Check-in was smooth, and I was delighted to receive a complimentary snack (yummy pineapple tarts). We then proceeded to use the pool and there were no issues at all with the booking in place. The housekeeping staff was so nice to check in on us to ensure if we needed change of towels already. When we were out taking a walk in the…",5,June 2021,
A Magical MOment,S L,"Had a memorable stay at MO in the midst of the P2HA period. Opulence abound. Think dark wood work and various Oriental themed ornaments . This carries on to the guestroom with beautiful carpets, white marblnd furniture with wood panelling that mimics the shape of the fan.  We are grateful that late check out was graciously extended to us. The staff at the pool and spa were very friendly. We had dinner in room due to restaurant dine in restriction and the experience was magical. MO has clearly displayed its positioning as a luxury hotel that does not compromise on delivering a 5* guest experience. This is most evident in the breakfast service, whereby the food was  served in room with proper diningware and white starched linens, unlike other hotels that serve them in takeaway…",5,June 2021,
Best staycation experience !,Shirley K,"Would like to thank the whole team of Mandarin Oriental Hotel for making my recent staycation a wonderful one. Initially I used my Singapore Rediscover Voucher to place the booking without expecting much in return, just wanted a place to rest and re-charge. However, I was really impressed with the service provided by its staffs, their politeness and willingness to offer whatever help is required. My friend and I also enjoyed the welcome sparkling juices, snacks and sumptuous breakfast. Liked the nice view facing Marina Bay Sands as well 👍 Thanks for offering us early check before 12noon and late checkout at 4pm. We will definitely consider going back again for future staycations, and also introduce it to other friends 😊",5,June 2021,
STAYCATION JUNE 2021,Kate S,"We have a good staycation at Mandarin Oriental Singapore though the check in was not so quick.  As Fan of MO, we choose to check in early at noon.  Upon arrival at about that time, was told as registration was ongoing that the room wasnt ready.  Surprised.  After some points of registration, another lady appeared from the office behind the front desk and we were told that she was going to check if a room with balcony as requested by us was ready.  The young lady didnt come back before we finished the registration so we were ushered to sit somewhere near the reception area.  After some minutes, no one appeared so went to counter and was told to hang on for a little while more ( the lady who registered us was busy with a couple of young ladies checking in to the hotel).  More…",4,June 2021,
Excellant service from everyone,Gary W,"As usual, everyone in the hotel displayed the same high level of service standards. Regardless of their roles, they will always think ahead of ways to surpass your request and make your stay memorable. As Mandarin Oriental has been around for a very long time, it is inevitable that things get worn and amenities get dated, thus the 4 star rating. Overall the stay was delightful and everyone aims to make our stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible despite the restrictions in place due to Covid and try their very best to accede to our requests.",4,May 2021,
Memorable Time at Mandarin Oriental during Phase 2 - H.A.,Leon L,"Bed was very plush and comfortable. The room as well as the marble-tiled toilet had an overall luxury feel to it. The hotel was quite empty during our stay, perhaps even less than half the hotel was occupied as it was a weekday. We stayed in the Marina Bay View room, which had a spectacular view of the Marina Bay area. When staying in this room, we found ourselves just staring out the window at the view, as a view like this is hard to come by.   The breakfast provided was tasty but we found the portions for the mains slightly insufficient. The swimming pool area had cabanas to enjoy the view while relaxing by the pool, although during this time of Covid, guests are limited to only 1 hour by the pool which we felt was insufficent.  As we were celebrating our anniversary during…",5,June 2021,
Staycation,Esther,"Mandarin Oriental is considered an old hotel and I was initially chose it as the pool looks fantastic. However, the interior was still well maintained and looked very classy. Also i was lucky enough to be given a highest floor with the ocean view, which was so so so good. Their service was also impecable, with welcome snacks, smiles on their faces and always making sure we are well taken care of. The pool is fantastic, though it looked smaller than the official photos, the benches are always clean and filled with clean towels. The view from the pool is also very good. We has many requests as we have our kids with us but the room service was always quick.

Hui Ru and Shannon helped to check us in and the interactions with them were really pleasant and made us feel welcome.   We stayed during heightened alert phase and dining in was not allowed by government regulation. My family were looking forward to trying out the highly acclaimed restaurants for in-room dining however, all restaurants were closed and the only available menu was a smaller selection from the in-room dining menu. The closure of restaurants were not made known at any point, neither was this information available on the hotel’s website as well.

Exceptional despite HA,family_ong_4,"Extremely delighted with this stay. We do like to treat ourselves to staycations every few months and this is likely the best stay ever as the hotel is very accommodating to families. We bought a voucher for a night’s stay in the city suite which came with b&b for third and fourth occupants. Check-in was fantastic as I had communicated earlier via their WhatsApp channel that I had put in a few requests. We were given an upgrade as well as a welcome amenity for MO members. The suite was lovely - spacious enough for two adults and two teens to lounge and yet come together to eat at the dining table. TWG tea bags, coffee capsules, an extensive spread for the in-room breakfast - no expense was spared. What I really appreciate was the hotel’s commitment to the environment in not…",5,May 2021,

Great staycation,Fared Jhi,"Been wanting to stay here for the longest time and finally did it. I would like to say, the room and hotel ambience is quite cosy and the Diptyque amenities dispensers were really nice not to mention the 'We Care' pack which were very thoughtful.  Favourite highlight would be the pool with the inifnity-ish pool deck with sunbed. Plus, the cabanas is such a nice private area to lounge at with views of Marina Bay, an absolute gem as well.  Breakfast was in-room due to HA, which was good. A hearty set, although miscommunication among the staff was made but it was resolves in such a short span that it didn't ruin my breakfast at all.

I requested for upgrade to Grand Ocean Room (not free, they insisted that I pay for it at a discounted price but it’s all worth it) and she even brought the key to my room.   Having been on frequent staycations every 3 months, most of the 5 stars hotels do send you welcome email closer to check in date. There was however no welcome email 1-3 days before check-in from the hotel to inform you on the check in time or at least send me the menu for the lunch which was included. When asked, they still tell me checkin time is at 3pm which was way past lunch time, then told me I can check in at 1pm after reminder.

The only downside would be that their pillows are too soft! And the bath gel/shampoo and conditioner didnt smell too nice to me. It felt as if the bath liquids were left there for months.

Great hospitality and safe,Chin71,Hotel premises are clean and staff friendly despite the challenging situation they face. Can sense that safety is their utmost concern and staff do gently remind even swimmers who got out of the pool to put on mask if they have forgotten. That is reassuring.

To be honest, we are Marriott loyalists but wanted to try someplace new - and “MO” didn’t disappoint.  From the start, it was a pleasant and easy experience.  With all of the safe distancing and reduced capacity measures, enjoying hotel amenities has become a scheduled activity which doesn’t carry the same charm as being able to laze endlessly by the pool!  Unlike other hotels, MO offers a seamless reservation system through WhatsApp and allows guests to prebook their pool and restaurant slots.

Warm and Welcoming,Jeremy N,"I planned for my proposal a few weeks before the actual staycation at Mandarin Oriental.  When emailing the staff, Princess was more than willing to facilitate my recce of the possible layout for the room. She even brought me up to the room (with Safe Distancing in place) and showed me the amazing views of the Marina Bay area from the window, which completely locked in the hotel as my proposal destination.  During the set up phase before the proposal, the staff were helpful and went out of their way to help me with my requirements and wishes. They facilitated the booking of a romantic dinner at Dolce Vita (the Italian restaurant in Mandarin Oriental) as a successful celebration of the proposal, and were even kind enough to allow my fiancee and I a late checkout on the last…",5,May 2021,
Room needs an upgrade to keep it in line with the MO brand,Wrenkahn25,"Overall an above average hotel stay. The common areas are stunning, however room is dated and breakfast quality is below average. The Nasi Lemak had no protein at all except an otah and a boiled egg. The hotel might attribute this to the enhance measure by the government that restricts dining in, but Park Royal Marina Bay is serving Nasi Lemak with lobsters and all.",3,May 2021,

Once you open the door, you will see the birthday balloons and cake waiting and the lovely view of the city!  It was a big room with 2 toilets and separate spacious living room area.  Complimentary beds were provided for our kids and we had a comfortable king size bed to ourselves.  Shopping was convenient at marina Square which was right next door.  Kids get to play at Kidztopia with tickets arranged a week in advance by the staff as part of our staycation package.  Breakfast was ala carte buffet style and was delicious with great service.

Mandarin Oriental is definitely one of my top hotels that I will choose to stay in again.",5,May 2021,
Excellent experience for family staycation,Benny,"We did a 4 day, 3 night stay at the Mandarin Oriental Ocean Grand Room with our 10 month old. The view was AMAZING!   We were most impressed with the service in MOSIN. We were warmly welcomed with balloons and a personalised message for Baby A. Room service was quick and attentive to our needs. The poolside experience was lovely. We especially enjoyed our spa experience at the Mandarin Spa- the therapists were skilled, and the overall experience was one of the best we have ever had.    Situated next to Marina Square, a stone’s throw from MBS and the Gardens by the Bay, we had no shortage of things to do and places to dine at.   ",5,May 2021,
Little Singapoliday in Singapore,Ninjia,"I would like to extend my compliments to room sales staff Julia Y for her utmost professional service during our entire booking process.

Upon check-in, staff at the counter was very welcoming and cheerful (sorry didn’t catch her name!)

Outstanding Birthday Staycation,Unazaki,"Stayed over the weekend from 6 May 2021 to 9 May 2021 to celebrate my birthday and I have to say that the product offerings and service are exemplary. Despite only booking an Ocean View Room and not selecting the Room Upgrade perk, I was given a free upgrade to the Marina Bay View Room on account of this being a birthday staycation. Just upon check-in, and I was already seeing the signs of Mandarin Oriental's legendary service.  The room itself was incredible as well, with a spectacular view of the Marina Bay, lots of space and a very neat working desk that easily doubles as a dining table. The bed was exquisite, with comfortable cushions and throw pillows, in addition to the primary king sized pillows on the bed, all stuffed with feathers and down as I had requested. I…",5,May 2021,

Fantastic Staycation!,Jiayong,"The whole experience we had from the moment we step in MOSIN till the end of our staycation was awesome! The room was well prepared with amenities and we didn't expect there were balloons with drawing on it to greet our kids. A cute small tent was another surprise for the kids. Never expect that my kids enjoy so much, end up I will have to prepare them in the bath tub 3 times a day! Breakfast at the Melt cafe was wonderful too, lot of choices to choose from American breakfast to Asian breakfast. It is so convenient that Marina Square is just beside the hotel where you can do a shopping or to have a meal, not forgetting Pororo park and Kiztopia is located there too. Lastly, well done to the Team and we will definitely be back again soon!",5,May 2021,
Wonderful 3D2N staycation,cheytan,"My friends and I booked a suite for a birthday celebration. The Marina Bay view was absolutely stunning during day and night.

Amazed by Mandarin Oriental Again! 🥳🥳🥳,Orange,"We had our staycation with @mo_singapore, the team amazed us once again with their great service. My daughter enjoyed herself so much! She loves pulling her little luggage to her room. When she entered the room, she found balloons with her name and that got her excited. Next she found a little note for her on the bed with the MANDARIN Panda. A tent full of balloons sat at the side welcoming her, Wow! Little slippers and bathrobe were also made available for this little guest. There she is, sitting like a little influencer having her room service. The room service gentleman brought this little guest apple juice, muffins and extra fries. Because they heard her voice over the phone. Set up the table and made her comfortable for a meal.

Avoid Twin Beds,UWA_Traveller,"I had a high floor twin bedroom with fabulous Marina Bay view. Check in was smooth and overall service at the hotel was warm and friendly. In fact the hotel texted me with an invitation to check in early at 9am as rooms were available.  Hotel was quiet and had an exclusive feel. The swimming pool area is nice with cabanas but lack some privacy as it’s right next to the Italian restaurant. Breakfast was very good with wide ala carte selection, and items brought to your table quickly.   I gave it an average rating mainly because of the quality of the twin beds. They were way too soft, making for a very uncomfortable night of sleep (or rather, lack of sleep). They were also narrow and pushed together, not like the newer 5 star hotels where you get separate Queen-sized beds. The…",3,April 2021,

"Keep it up where you do well, MO and polish up where you fail to measure up",Sal the Fat Fish,"Many reviewers have described the high service standards, the cleanliness of the room and the nice amenities. I shan't waste more time describing these; suffice to say that I agree with them all.  The one thing which truly took my breath away was the view from the room; look at the photo attached. It was even nicer at night, when the Singapore Flyer lit up and the symphony of light show dazzled from the Marina Bay Sands, while the super tress of the Gardens by the Bay sparkled. It was WOW!  Yet there were issues. Chief among them the truly average breakfast offerings at Meltz, which I believe was due to the pandemic which meant a much reduced selection, the lack of staff (existing ones looked so so overworked obviously) and the uninspiring standard for the food served. And the…",4,April 2021,

Staycation,Olh,"Went for a staycay to celebrate couple's anniversary. They accommodated to all my requests, such as getting a bouquet of flowers at a very reasonable price, and which were also extremely fresh. Also provided us with a slice of cake and helped us to take a photo as a momento.   Not the end, they allowed for late check out all the way till 6pm, which was a great courtesy given by them. Pool was great too, venue was super near marina square/suntec for meals if not dining at the hotel.   Kinda wished I had a slightly higher floor as I went on a weekday, but hey I'm nitpicking already haha.  All in all though, fantastic service and definitely recommend MO as a venue for staycation.",5,May 2021,
Great lunch buffet experience at Melt Cafe,Kim,"We visited the Melt Cafe for a luncheon & the experience was great! I could tell that they paid attention to the quality of the food that they serve.

Second best hotel in Marina Bay area,nyu2n,"I stayed here for 1 night in Jan with a very good deal from klook which include late checkout till 6PM and dining credits!  First of all, the check-in is fast and no long queue. The front desk is also warm and welcoming. Room was clean although the bathtub didn't really work. Upgraded to ocean view which was amazing (somehow better than marina bay view although the second one is more ex). The highlight of our stay is the pool! It is big and not crowded. My toddler loves the pool a lot. Even when we stayed at the 6 starts hotel just beside this, she keep pointing at this swimming pool. Such a memorable things for her.

Might warp your life expectations - be warned!,Berji L,"My buddies and I had a short staycation at Mandarin Oriental over the weekend where we checked into a suite which, I was told, was usually booked for diplomats.  It was bigger than my own home. Also, way more luxurious than my own home as well. The moment I returned home, I find myself feeling bitter, yearning for that weekend stay of great comfort and excellent service that I had.",5,April 2021,
Staycation mandarin oriental,Khai,"Great stay, hospitable staff and they had a petit cake for all 3 rooms that I booked to celebrate my nephew’s 21st bday.

Cockroach and throwing away birthday cards,Christina V,"Arrived for  birthday staycation and welcomed by a lovely member of staff who took us to the room to find balloons which was a very nice surprise and great added personal touch.  In terms of service the pool attendants were extremely helpful throughout the visit but some of the receptionists had a little attitude.  On the day of my birthday I was resting on the bed to find a cockroach walking next to me, staff reacted very quickly and this was removed within 30 minuets. We were asked to leave the room for it to be deep cleaned and the cleaners threw away all my birthday cards in the process (from the UK).   I know this was a mistake but the fact I had to call and tell them a few times without an apology was disappointing.   I would not recommend this hotel for service or…",2,April 2021,
Awesome Stay!!,Jocelyn,"Had a totally awesome stay at MO!!! We planned this staycation as a birthday celebration for my 3 year daughter and they totally nailed it.  From our arrival, uncle Chan was super friendly and my girl was very welcomed by him at the driveway while my husband when to park the cark. As we entered the hotel lobby everyone were very warm and kind. Checked in was a breeze, Chole was gracious and very professional. She is very patient with me as my girl was roaming around the lobby and i had to catch her a few times before my husband arrives.  My daughter loved the teepee tent and balloons setup for her by the housekeeping and guest relations team.

Great stay!,Jia,"After our first stay in November, my boyfriend and I decided to come back to MO to celebrate his birthday. The staff were extremely attentive and hospitable. Both times we went for a celebration, the staff took the effort to decorate the room and have some cake/complimentary soda ready for us when we arrived. We've stayed in both the Ocean View and Marina Bay View rooms and both were excellent! Kayta, who was processing the check-in for us, was very sweet and even showed us up to our room to tell us more about the hotel! She also took photos for us in the room and had one developed and sent to our room later in the day. Overall, was a great experience and will definitely be back in the future. :)",5,April 2021,
WOW WOW WOW,LW,"This is my first stay at MO and was indeed very pleased with the overall experience. I was initially trying to decide on a hotel which will give me a WOW experience and decided that MO was the chosen one after shortlisting a few hotels.  I was greeted by an enthusiastic reservations colleague - Siyun who provided every information that I require and went an extra mile when she knew that it was my wife's birthday and also celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary. Her assurance and prompt follow up was indeed essential to make me look forward to the special day.  When I checked in, i was also greeted by many happy faces which you don't really see it in many established hotels. From the front, you can feel the cheerful mood and even when we checked in, the small talks and…",5,April 2021,
A lovely personalised experience for the family again.,SingaporeCbu,"This is the second time I have stayed at the hotel with my family.  We stayed in a suite which gave us a bit more room, each of our children had a pull out bed to sleep on and there was enough room (both times) for us to not feel we were on top of each other.  The rooms are in good condition and spotlessly clean.  Nothing to complain or worry about at all.  The best part of our experience however was the staff.  Everyone was happy, pleasant, cheerful and polite.  The staff went out of their way to make our holiday the best it could be and nothing was ever too much trouble.  I loved how people knew us, remembered the children and generally made the whole stay the best it could possibly be.   We will definitely return for our 3rd stay because of the excellent levels of customer…",5,April 2021,

3D2N stay,Curious500467,Would like to compliment Mandarin Oriental for the good service and good stay! The room is clean just that the bed is too soft.

Upon checking in with our IDs, they realised my birthday would be the next day, they arranged for a photograph to be taken in the room and printed it as a card for me as a momento. A surprise deco was also created when we left the hotel for lunch. Nearby malls like suntec city, marina square and millenia walk makes the hotel super convenient with 2 mrt station just minutes walk away! The view is also spectacular, can imagine how beautiful it would be during national day with the fireworks! I love it that they are babies friendly, providing baby bath tub, steriliser as well as high chair when we ordered room service. Awesome view, immaculate service & affordable price!",5,April 2021,

Excellent Service with plenty of smiles 😃,limboonchung,"Despite the long holiday weekends, check in took no longer than 20 mins. The hotel staffs were most welcoming and attentive to our requests and needs. The upgraded room was wonderful and the fruit platter provided was most substantial as compared to plenty of 5 ⭐️ hotels we have stayed. Breakfast spread though limited due to current circumstances, quality is top notched and ranked highly. It certainly remains one of the main highlight of our stay.. it’s service staff were ever ready to go round and take our orders.. and with a smile 😊.

Easter weekend @MO,trvkaki,"We spent the Easter weekend at MO and it was a great start with an early check in at 12.15pm as we have booked a lunch at Melt.  The queue for the check in took thereabout 10mins while the actual check in process was 5mins. All in it was a short waiting time especially when this was a long weekend.  MO room, while properly maintained and clean, needs a revamp to keep up with the times. The shower water was cold in the morning even when turned to the hottest, likely due to heavy shower usage by many rooms in the morning. It was nevertheless still a comfortable and enjoyable stay although the bed was too soft for my liking.

It also felt healthy to be able to do long walks along the Marina bay, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer, all in the vicinity. It was such a welcoming experience right from the time of booking with Mandarin Oriental, till the end of our stay.

"Excellent, thank you Mandarin !",Rebecca Lim,"Held my wedding at Mandarin and I couldn’t ask for a better hotel, staffs and banquet crew. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything runs smoothly on this special day. My heartfelt thanks Banquet Operations manager, Mr. Anshul Pathania; Banquet operations executive, Mr. Jason Oon, Mr. Lim Kang Le; Chinese banquet chef for the very impressive and sumptuous dinner, Chef Tan Eng Kok.

Memorable Anniversary & Birthday Staycation,Yoqi77,"It is a family staycation... I bring not 1 or 2..  BUT 4 kids to the suite for staycation for a night. I came into the room with decorations and 2 mini cakes.  The housekeeping team is attentive.. They gave Batman kids mask and also kids slipper.  4kids, What to expect? Mess!! The hotel staff clean up the room again when they bring in the rollaway bed.  They even did photocard for us to bring back after the staycation. My kids enjoyed and stay and very excited.  It was abit disappointing cause we didnt manage to book the pool as it was fully booked.  It is convenient with city tours, kidtopia, pororo park, NERF at MQ. Opp is between esplanade & helix bridge. Basically you dont need to get your car out of the carpark after you parked.  Find a snipshot photo from my time lapse…",5,March 2021,
Great pool staff,Shumin L,"We had a short staycation, and what made the stay really special was the pool (we went daily). The view of the Bay was fantastic. But what was even better than was the pool staff, led by Pradeep. On the first day, we thought we'd try our luck even though we didn't have a booking. Perhaps seeing my two young children, Pradeep said he could accommodate us because the pool happened to be relatively empty at that point in time. The flexibility and understanding was really appreciated. Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,March 2021,
Choose Marina Oriental for your 2D1N Staycation,Justine L,"Excellent Value for Money 2D1N Staycation at Marina Oriental (MO) for $360 which included wifi, a lovely ala-carte buffet breakfast and $80 dining credit. After using the Singapore Discovery Voucher $100 and $30 UOB Card Promo  to deduct, I paid $230 for a Seaview Deluxe Room for two pax.   Early Check-in and Free Room Upgrade  I called the hotel at 10am to request for an early check in and they told me warmly that my room was ready. During the check in, I requested for a free upgrade from a sea view room to a Bay view room which they agreed out of good will. These details showed that MO was out to serve and satisfy their guests’ requests. Check out was 6pm as specified in the confirmation voucher and Klook app. That was an additional 6h stay for free.

Average,HappyTummy,"We have booked a city suite for 4 pax.   Check-In: Service is not consistent. Did not tell us that we could sign up as MO fan while we heard the counter staff beside us explaining. Was told that we would be given our group photo when check-out but the staff did not realise until we ask. They did not print it but at least they sent us the photo by post.   Room: Spacious but outdated. Lovely for them to give a birthday cake, fruit platter & balloons  Gym: Wanted to try out the BMI machine. Was told to sanitise myself with the wet wipe before using instead of sanitising the machine for us to use  Breakfast: Food was meh and the service was horrible.

You can see in its full glory, MBS, the Floating Platform, Esplanade and Fullerton Hotel.  We were advised to make prior bookings for the pool, which I did via whatsapp. It was an easy and fuss free process. The pool was great and me and my family had a blast playing in it.  Upon arrival, we were also greeted with a welcome gift pack for my kid. Meals at the Melt Cafe were great too. Marina Square shopping mall was just directly next to the hotel.

Wonderful stay experience with personalised service,Gisten,"Booked a 1-night Ocean View Room staycation package via Klook using SRV. A detailed confirmation email from hotel’s Reservations team came pretty fast within a day confirming my room reservation with the included benefits and was also advised to book the hotel facilities by contacting the Guest Relations team via Whatsapp. It was very fast and efficient using Whatsapp to book pool time slots, make enquiries and request for assistance. They usually responded within minutes to no longer than an hour. I greatly appreciated their swift response and assistance.   On the morning of our check-in day, I received a Whatsapp message at 10.40a.m informing that our room was ready for early check-in. We were pleasantly surprised.

Perfect for our honeymoon!,Regina,"My husband and I firstly booked Mandarin the night after our wedding. When we arrived, there was a turndown service for us, with gifts of wine and chocolate, and they were even kind enough to take photos for us and gave us a printed copy after we checked out. Most of all, we were upgraded to a better room, which had a very good view of the Marina Bay.  Just one day had passed after our first night at Mandarin, we decided to book again for 3 more nights. We tried looking for other hotels but we were very much satisfied with the service of Mandarin Oriental so it was a no brainer for us. To our surprise, we were again upgraded even though this was already our second “honeymoon booking” with them.   Breakfast was superb— it was like buffet although it was served. Taste was not…",5,March 2021,
Superb hotel experience,Joey Amedo,"Nothing beats a honeymoon experience in a very comfortable and superb hotel like Mandarin Oriental. We checked in twice during our honeymoon period! Yes, we went back because the place really is that good, classy modern, squeaky clean, manned with excellent staff, awesome room with Marina bay view, and amazing unlimited breakfast sets. I probably gained weight because of it. Ooops.  We opted to return because my wife and I didnt want to risk going to another hotel as MO had already exceeded our expectations.   Mike, in particular, accomodated us well and made our entire experience very pleasing. Overall, the service team did an amazing job keeping our rooms tidy, and they were very prompt to respond with all our requests.   Highly recommended. We will surely be back!",5,March 2021,
Beautiful view and comfortable stay,Shive81,"Very comfortable staycay! We got the Marina Bay view room and was on the 21st floor. The view is spectacular! All of us love the view so much!!   Staffs are all very warm and friendly too! Right from the time we stepped in, the concierge offered to help us bring our luggage to our room while we have our lunch at Melt Cafe. The food is great! Staffs are very helpful! Managed to have the room ready at 1.40pm too! So we checked into our room so much earlier! :)  One thing is the hotel does not have lift access to the carpark, so if you are driving and coming with luggage you gotta come up via Marina Square.   And also the toilet doesn’t come with a bidet and the shower head is non adjustable in the shower room so a bit tricky to bathe the LO. In the end gotta bathe the LO in the…",5,March 2021,

The thoughtful hotel team not only decorated the hotel bed with nice balloons, one of the staff even showed up at our room shortly after we checked in with a slice of cake :D  We were upgraded and very fortunate to have a room with the whole marina bay view. Superb scenery that the whole family enjoyed at different time throughout the day.  The room is decent and comfortable, expected Mandarin Oriental's standard. Check in was a bliss, though lobby is a little dated. Had a relaxing 2 hour slot at the pool.

Thank you for an exceptional stay!,KhalisMuhammad,"Our inaugural stay at Mandarin Oriental Singapore left a lasting impression. Hospitality was top-notch, from reservation to the actual 3D2N stay. The small touches like the birthday balloons with handwritten message and the room slippers for our daughter made the experience very personalised.  The team made us feel welcomed throughout our stay and really raised the benchmark of what Hotel standards should be, considering we've had staycations at 7 different local hotels.

Excellent service + great value for money staycation,flying_Geo,"Excellent: SERVICE (throughout the hotel from pre-trip to restaurant to check-in to housekeeping and room service); room size and amenities; pool and gym facilities  Ok: room is not the most modern as the hotel was last renovated in 2004 (according to Wikipedia); view from the room (probably could have requested for one with better view as ours was facing Suntec City and Pan Pacific Hotel)  Room for improvement: really nothing much; of course if the hotel decides to close for renovation or refurbishment of the rooms, it would be even better.

Also heard from my fiance's friends that the balloon set up as part of the proposal were tangled up when they arrived in the room.

I had a previous staycay at another luxury hotel (St. Rxxxx) and I was simply shocked at how different the service was between these two hotels. The service rendered at St. Rxxxx simply puts their world-renowned name to shame. Whereas the service at MO was sincere and gracious.

The guest relations officer, Debbie, guided us to the lift thereafter, a first amongst the array of 5 star hotel stays. We were indeed charmed.  The gymnasium was well equipped with the gym staff, Salihin, readily assisting and guiding us with the body fat measurement machine after our strenuous workout. Drinks ordered at the opulently embroidered MO bar in the evening were nothing short of delectable. We could certainly see why it was an award winning bar.

Meltz Cafe and Hotel’s overall review,Hazel Teo,"Thank you for the pleasant facilities in Mandarin Oriental. I would gladly give credits to the housekeepers and a specific guy whom was helping out at Meltz Cafe on 15th Feb for our lunch buffet.  (he was in red tie and probably the only chinese guy in black blazer with his specs on) would like to thank his humbleness and prompt service which managed to salvage our bad impression of the services during our lunch.  Would like to highlight a complaint against ‘Ganesh’ who seem to be a supervisor or manager in Meltz Cafe, of his poor attitude and service towards guests.  First, we were directed in by the receptionists and was told to browse the menu through our phones after scanning the QR code provided.

Bridal table was being served by Alice and I cannot thank her enough. She was ever ready with anything we need and we were very grateful for her. Our guests at the other tables were also singing praises to all their servers. Always attentive and very polite.   Our event coordinator, Katelynn, was also a delight to work with. She made us feel at ease, making sure we are not being stressed out. She gave so much assurance to make sure the wedding was planned beautifully.   The room we stayed at was alittle tired but it was clean. Nothing to complain again  However, the staff who attended to us during check out was a little disappointing. Even though with explanation from us and her…",5,November 2020,
Excellent service and thoughtfulness of the staff,Joshua Tan,"We had previously stay at M.O. for my girlfriends birthday and we delighted that they had surprised us with a birthday cake for her. We had decided then to return for our anniversary and upon informing them, were told that they would take care of us and we were excited when we were escorted to our rooms which was decorated with balloons!   We loved the welcome message and Sy from the Guest Relations team even helped us take a picture which they then printed and gave as a card the next day which was so thoughtful of them. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely want to come back for more celebrations in the future!",5,February 2021,
Wonderful Experience in MO,Edria C,"We had a wonderful experience during our stay with Mandarin Oriental for Valentine’s Day.

Memorable staycay in Mandarin Oriental Singapore,Shi Yue,"Thanks to Friend and Family promotion, we booked 3 rooms and get upgraded to Ocean View and Marina Bay View. Every moment from our check in to our room are full with ""Wow"" factor. Our kids enjoy the stay so much especially the pool. Special thanks to Katya for the treats by the poolside, and Stalin the lifeguard to help us with photos while not forgetting his duty as a lifeguard. Of course other colleagues in various outlet and departments, everyone seems to put on their best smiles while working in Mandarin Oriental. Kudos to the management and all the staff here! We will be back again very soon!",5,February 2021,
Excellent service and food was fantastic,JTNW,"Great service and food - staff are friendly and helpful, going out of their way to help fulfill your needs. Food is excellent - ditch the buffet permanently for the the more relaxed and high quality 'unlimited ordering' style...  Location - it cant be helped but Suntec is a cultural desert, it is simply cement and you feel like you are in a big American mid-west city.  Property - dark, becoming a little aged, but well maintained. Will need a complete revamp in the next 2-3 years.",4,February 2021,
Highly recommended for staycation!,778chewa,"Loved the room, the pool and everything! Food was amazing - had both breakfast and lunch at Melt cafe and it was really quality food. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice staycation!",5,February 2021,

Birthday celebration,pinkopinko,We had a lovely 1 night stay at Mandarin oriental to celebrate my daughter's birthday which I informed the hotel beforehand. She was delighted to see balloons decorations in the room. The room is clean and spacious. We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and food and service is great. The staff are very welcoming and we felt very comfortable during the stay. Only thing is I did not realise that the Premier room does not have views of the singapore flyer!,4,February 2021,

We absolutely love the suite, the view, the facilities and every attention to details offered by all the staff.  We would like to thank Ms Princess who assisted us during check in. Mr Yiming and Ms Midori who showed us the room and even took a photo of us and framed it as our remembrance. Such a sweet gesture.  The breakfast was great, everyone was nice and accommodating. Thank you for the amazing experience Mandarin Oriental! We will definitely make it a comeback. ~Mr and Mrs Holt ",5,February 2021,
Awesome service,jowinnn,Had a birthday staycay at MO with my hubby. All the staff were very polite & helpful from the moment we checked-in. Received a complimentary cake & balloons on the bed. Was sweet of them to also give me a birthday card with our photo printed out. They also upgraded our room to a pool view.   Facilities were clean & good. It helped that there were not much people on a weekday so we had most of the pool & gym to ourselves.   Lunch buffet at melt cafe was the best! Quality seafood & great service by the restaurant staff.   Highly recommend!,5,February 2021,
Five stars and beyond,Darren Lopez,"A refreshing and pampering stay, service staffs with MO provide dedicated and top-notch service. Giving my special thanks to Jasherra from guest services, Alex from Meltz restaurant and the staffs from the gym. Check-in was prompt, escorted to the room within 15 minutes and was surprised with a simple celebatory setup. Room was clean and well equipped. Room view facing upon the Singapore flyer and MBS was splendid esp at night, try to request for such a view when occupancy are low (you'll thank me for it).   Breakfast seems alittle flustered, guess with most rooms comes with breakfast, the staffs seems to be all over the place with wrong order sent. Lunch was great, seafood platter served was fresh, we were well taken care by Alex over there. Pool wise is a must to visit, do…",5,January 2021,
Awesome staycation 👍👍👍,Johnstanno,"I choose MO for a staycation to celebrate my wife's birthday. We stayed in Marina Bay view room.   It was perfect and flawless from the moment we entered the hotel - early check-in, bags/belongings carried to room, some balloons with happy birthday writings, professional service staff, late check out and of cos the mesmerising view from our hotel room. Amenities like fast Wifi, Nespresso coffee machine, bathtub, wireless charging station for handphone and a very comfortable king side bed made me regret booking just 2D1N.  I will totally recommended booking MO for your staycation as you can enjoy the hotel facilities (such as swimming pool and restaurants) due to low occupancy rate.",5,February 2021,
Marina Bay View King Size Bed Room,Peter,"Great view, posh and comfy room.  Lots of welcome balloons which my 4 years old daughter was really delighted with. Welcome chocolate platter was nicely decorated though taste was so so. Had both Breakfast and Lunch buffet included in the package. Food was good but selection is a bit lacking because occupancy rate was low during COVID.",5,February 2021,
Highly recommended!,Jason Oh,"Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed our staycation at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore thanks to the superb service from the F&B team and the best view from our room!   We made full use of our stay there by trying out almost all the dining outlets in the hotel and we were very impressed by the consistency in the service. Thank you to the following staff for making us feel so at home: Sam, Albert and Eve from Cherry Garden, Anshul from Melt and Kamal and his team from MO Bar. But the best has got to be Mhelo from the poolside! Enjoyed the pool so much that we are thinking of our next staycation at MO already :)  -Jason Oh",5,January 2021,
Birthday Retreat,nashassan,Such a wonderful experience. Satisfaction started from the time we checked in.We were ushered to our room with early checkin.Room was superb.The view was fantastic.My daughter was greeted with baloons and cake and Apple Juice.Original was wine I think. Thank you Mandarin Oriental for taking care of our needs and made us feel at home. All staff played their part from bell boy to pool attendant and Gym manager.,5,February 2021,
Great customer service,Charlene,"Had a one night stay to celebrate my husband's birthday. Apart from the complimentary chocolate cake, what surprised me were the balloons with handwritten messages not only for my husband but for my toddler also, 'welcome princess xx'. What was cool was they also included a kodomo toiletries set for her, something we don't get at other hotels, including higher end hotels. Service staff were very friendly, whether at front desk or melt cafe. Love the late check out promo so we don't have to rush. What would be great would be to provide more parking coupons for multiple exits as it would be more convenient for us to drive out when required. For example, working to suntec is 10-15 mins but with children in tow, it would be much easier for us to drive. It would also be better if…",5,January 2021,
Best Hotel and services,Yun,"Super duper good services for the hotel guess relation team, I must said this is the best hotel and services I have stayed for staycation in SG so far! Many thanks for your room decoration with balloon for my wife's name and son, also the tasty birthday cake! Surprised by the birthday card made for my wife on the same day with the photo taken in our room by them. Foods are nice for breakfast, semi buffer lunch and in room dinning too, we like and enjoy! At this price and late check out, I don't see any other hotel can match the same. We are really enjoy and my wife also has a memorable birthday celebration in Marina Oriental Singapore Hotel. Compliments for all the hotel staffs, you deserved it.",5,January 2021,
Marina Bay View,kohleongfoo,"It is easy to take many things for granted when one stays in a hotel, especially a renowned 5-star one. This is particularly true for true-blue Singaporeans who have grown to expect nothing but the best. When things go right, these are expected; when things go wrong, even the best hotel becomes a shabby inn. Fortunately our experience is the former. That saying, MO went beyond expectations. From the thoughtful gestures such as the surprise decorations for our little one's birthday and lovely family photo, to the cheerful and friendly staff with their ever-smiling eyes, it has been a stay that rejuvenates the body as well as the soul. If I have to nitpick and think of something negative, it would probably be the wide range of food for the sumptuous buffet breakfast and…",5,January 2021,
Great Staycation!,Nelly l,"Love the personalised messages, the birthday balloons for my daughter, and the late check out till 6pm is so generous of Mandarin Oriental! Our family had a great time!  Just one thing, for the voucher usage limited to few dining options...  thot dinner at Dolce Gusto was too fine dine, melt is only for buffet... we were only left with bay5 which is dark n non aircon.... not as family friendly.  Otherwise lovely stay! We will be back! ",5,January 2021,

Best staycation experience so far,Sophia,"Did a 3D2N staycation, package included 2 bkfts and 2 lunches. Our first and definitely not the last. Extremely impressed with the great service (consistent throughout at the front-desk counter, operator, housekeeping and restaurant). Details such as additional towels (we were with 2 young kids), bathing essentials and checking in with us etc truly made our stay conmfortable. The food portion served at the ala carte buffet were just nice and if you want more, can always order again (this is better than std menu which waste food n limit the food variety). The beds and pillows are really comfortable! This is truly the best local hotel staycation so far, after trying a number of branded hotels.",5,February 2021,
Long Overdue Review,ShawnSugendran,I booked the Healthcare Heroes package and woah was I impressed with the impeccable service from start to finish. I booked the staycation for November 2020 to celebrate my birthday. Was with my family (3 active kiddos included) and in deed Mandarin Oriental never failed to ensure everyone in the family was taken care off.  Overall it was one of our best stays in any hotel around the world and I am happy to be able to do this in Singapore despite the travel restrictions and still have a great time.  Special Thanks to all the staff especially Ian and Terrance for making this occasion very memorable for my entire family. Cheers and see you all soon.  Shawn SK,5,November 2020,
Stunning view and spacious room,alanthegreat,"Booked a Marina Bay suite for staycation late last year.   The view of the room is stunning. Just for the view alone is worth the money.   The room is also comfortable. Love the sound systems in the adjoining bedroom. Surround speakers and a 50-60"" tv. So comfortable watching tv on bed that I can't get out of it!   Everything else is perfect. Visited the pool, and I felt it is a bit small for a hotel this size. But the cocktail is great.   Will visit this place again if I have the chance.",5,November 2020,
Great stay and service staff,Pen03,Opt for the 6pm late check out package via Klook and stayed there from 28-29 Jan for birthday celebrations.Read a number of great reviews online and we were definitely impressed when we experienced it ourselves.  We will definitely be back for more of our special moments in life.   Pls keep up the great work!,5,January 2021,

Birthday Staycation,kooifei,"We have a wonderful birthday staycation at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore! Our coordinator Ms Janet Wan was friendly and prompt in replying to our queries.  The hotel has kindly acceded to our request for a baby cot for our toddler.  From the conversation, they gathered that we are celebrating a birthday.

Birthday Staycation,Jacquelynn H,"Always our favourite choice for a family staycation. This time round to celebrate my god-daughter's Birthday.  The reservation team were very helpful, understanding and patient with our reservation request as we were using our sg vouchers for a 2 nights stay we booked online.

Pleasant stay during 2D1N,HS712,Had pleasant stay during 2D1N at Mandarin Oriental. We booked a semi-buffet lunch package (with late check-out at 6pm) for staycation purpose and everything was great. Cleanliness and view were great; staff were professional and friendly as well. Felt the Hello MO service was great idea in view of COVID19 situation (& for people like me who feel a little awkward to talk on the phone haha) where you get to WhatsApp the number instead. Response was fast as well. Particularly enjoyed the semi buffet lunch at the Melt Cafe. Will definitely recommend whoever considering staycation at this moment! :),5,January 2021,
A Home Away from Home 🏡,wanderwoman,"Stayed last December 2020 for a quick staycation. Safety management procedures of the hotel were on point especially when it comes to pool bookings and check-in.

Excellent,Jia,"Everything was just too perfect, be it service/food/room. Will definitely return again !   Your staff at the check-in counter was friendly and helpful in attending to us and even went extra mile in bringing us to our room personally and helping us to take photos.

I truly had an amazing wedding!,Mindy Tan,"My husband and I would like to thank Elizabeth and the banquet team for successfully running our wedding dinner in Mandarin Oriental on 16Jan2021. We are both truly grateful to have such a wonderful team to make our once in a lifetime event so meaningful and smoothly.  Mandarin Oriental was our first choice when we were exploring venues to hold our wedding banquet. We signed the contract in 2019 for our wedding to be held on 31Jul2020. However, Covid happened and we were uncertain to postpone or cancel our wedding. We had a meeting with our previous coordinator with regards to this and we encountered some issues communicating.   Hence, Elizabeth took over our case as soon as she is aware of it. The first time when we spoke was when she was hospitalised! I can imagine at that…",5,January 2021,
Wonderful Stay in a great hotel - Mandarin Oriental,Siew Wai,"We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The room was clean and big and the view was unbelievable. The staff were friendly and professional. When we gave feedback on the roti prata during breakfast, they took our feedback seriously because when we were back for breakfast the next day, the chef took the trouble to cook the roti prata and served them to us personally. Very impressed. Will definitely be back.",5,January 2021,
Thumbs up for the good service,Judy Tan,"I have a list of people I would like to thank!  Firstly, I sent my enquiries to Jacilyn Sim in regards to the booking of swimming pool and she replied promptly!  I would also like to thank Grace from the Melt cafe for being so patience with us when we had our dinner. As we needed non spicy fried rice for our toddler, she is helpful enough to request the kitchen to try expedite for us.   Thank your chefs for the scrumptious food and you guys really expedite the fried rice for my hungry toddler! Appreciate it!   Lastly, I would like to feedback that it would be good to add on the beverages inside the e-menu, so the staff will not have to be overwhelmed by the enquiries. Cheers!

Wonderful experience,vee,"Warm welcome by Mandarin Oriental's staff. They prepared balloons for my children and they absolutely LOVED them. Location is great, near the mall and easily accessible.

Enjoyed my stay!,Siao Wen,"Booked the Ocean Grand room with my sister for a staycation and totally enjoyed it! Love the spread at the breakfast - you can try all the desired dishes (unlike some other hotels only allowed one choice of main dish). Love the swimming pool the most, especially the Capanas. We were lucky to get one!   The areas for improvement - in room hair dryer is too difficult to use for long period. Too big a crowd for breakfast, not enough staff for the guests - causes some waiting time.   Would go back again, and in fact I’m going back again in April 2021! Looking forward!",4,December 2020,
Family Staycation Well Spent,Syrah_09,"Check-in process was very smooth. Appreciate the team for allocating rooms overlooking the Marina Bay. Rooms were in very good and clean condition.

Will definitely  return and recommend anyone coming to Singapore to stay here.",5,January 2021,
5 star hotel with impeccable service,tiramisu_life,"We chosen MO for our staycation after reading the reviews. And it has lived to our expectations. Check-in was smooth with welcoming guest relations staff. They were all smiles and also took note of our requests. We booked a Marina Bay view room and the view is stunning. Our experience (breakfast and lunch) at Melt Cafe is worth mentioning. Instead of simply taking orders, the staff went the extra mile to advise us on food choices. We ended having more variety and less wastage, which is great. We have been talking about our stay at MO after our staycation. And yes, we will definitely choose to stay at MO again.",5,December 2020,
Felt right at home,M. Gazder-Heng,"My husband and I did a short staycation at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore to celebrate our anniversary. We experienced such warm welcome from all the staff we interacted with, especially Princes who checked us in, to Ronny who served us at Dolce Vita both times we visited.  Despite it being our first time ever staying with the MO Group, we were welcomed like family and made to feel right at home.   The views from the hotel were spectacular as well, with our room overlooking the Marina Bay area. Our plans to explore the neighbouring area were foiled due to the incessant rain but we were happy for the excuse to spend more time in the room.  I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel!",5,January 2021,
Great and Clean Hotel in Singapore,IMKH,We stayed for a night for a staycation. The premier room was clean and neat.   The swimming pool was great too.

Great stay experience with top-notch service,HW0,"It was a pleasant stay at Mandarin Oriental and wonderful staycation experience. The check-in process was relatively smooth and as more people arrived for check-in behind me,  I saw that the staff did their best to help one another out to clear the queue as quickly as possible by opening up more counters.   My family and I booked 3 rooms and even though it was not requested, they arranged for connecting rooms for us, and all 3 rooms were side-by-side which further enhanced our stay.   We booked the Ocean View room and had stunning view of Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer and the CBD skyline. Room was spacious and everything was well taken care of.

Wedding Banquet Dinner,Linghui T,"MO was our preferred choice when selecting a venue for our wedding event. My husband and I was lucky to have met Elena Ong (Events Management Senior Manager). Elena was professional, responsive, attentive and gave us valuable advice on wedding planning, she went above and beyond to assist with our request.   We were pretty skeptical when Elena told us, we couldn’t sample the banquet prior to the wedding. However she assured us and told us with confidence that the food is excellent and there is nothing to be worried about. And indeed the food was AWESOME, many of guests raved about the food. We added an another rice dish, as our guest are pretty big eater. So in total we had 9 course dinner banquet.  On the night of banquet, the banquet manager Jovine did everything as planned.…",5,January 2021,
"Excellent service, above and beyond!",MD_008,"I would first like to extend my thanks to all the staff of Mandarin Oriental for our stay from 10/1/2021 – 11/1/2021.   I was planning for a surprise anniversary celebration for my wife and decided to choose Mandarin Oriental due to the promotional offer that was too good to avoid.   I was referred to a staff from the Guest relations team, Juliana, from a friend within Mandarin Oriental. Juliana went out and above to ensure that I get my booking through Trip.sg right and using the Singapore Rediscover voucher. She ensured that she will have my anniversary surprise ready for my wife. She also recommended  to have a high-tea at Dolce Vita using the dining voucher by Mandarin Oriental. It was my first time so she assisted in booking our high-tea session. I really appreciate and…",5,January 2021,
Nice staycation in an outstanding hotel,Ramesh G,"Had 1 night staycation on eve of xmas. Good feeling to see a lot of guest in the hotel. Staff very friendly and explaining all the new norm SOP. Safe Distance been practiced and staff are there to make sure guest follow the 1 meter rules. We were given room overlook Marina bay and it is stunning. Worth the dollar spent. Very specious room, comfort bed and wonderful shower. Food presentation was fantastic. We order In Room Dining and try the signature Onion Soup.  Thank you for the experience and will come back again. ////Ramesh",5,December 2020,
Truly memorable staycation,Ashley Liew,"Of the three staycations my wife and I have been to since the COVID-19 pandemic started, this hotel experience was by far the best! Top marks for cleanliness which is especially important during this period. We felt really safe here throughout our entire experience. They even provided surgical masks for guests in the room: a small but very meaningful touch. We loved that extra effort by the staff to welcome us back for our first stay here since our wedding there in 2019; the balloons and birthday cake in the room were such pleasant surprises for my wife who was celebrating her birthday weekend! It turned out to be a very  rainy weekend, so although we couldn't use the beautiful swimming pool we spent most of the time enjoying the beautiful hotel room with the amazing views.…",5,January 2021,
Perfect Staycation Choice for the Family,Susan Chua,"Had a fantastic staycation at Mandarin Oriental Singapore. My girl had a stayca here with her friends in Dec last year and they had such a good time that I just have to bring my family this year. We were impressed with the spacious room, ocean view and fuss-free service and were also pleasantly surprised by the hotel’s extra efforts to decor the room and include a complimentary cake for my mum’s birthday. My family enjoyed the stay very much. Special thanks to Jonathan who has been extremely helpful in offering assistance for the booking of my stay on both occasions via the SRV redemption. Highly recommended for locals to redeem SRV with Mandarin Oriental!",5,January 2021,
Great hotel with great staff,soujiokita,"With so many hotels in Singapore, one big factor would definitely be the accommodating and friendliness of the staff. Dinner at melt was fabulous. They are having lobster buffet right now Would definitely recommend! ",5,January 2021,
One of the best,TravellingJerz,"In a city that has new five-star hotels popping up every year, the Mandarin Oriental has managed to distinguish itself year after year by offering top class services and maintaining its upkeep at an exceptional standard. The atrium is one of the most magnificent in town, and the pool has an unbeatable view of both the MBS and the commercial skyline. If you ever stay here, do not miss the MO bar. Would definitely visit again! ",5,January 2021,

"Awesome service, stunning views. Be amazed",wfeo,"From reservations, to check in, to housekeeping, to F&B, to concierge, to check out, they did amazingly well! We expected hiccups, compromises, as Covid restrictions were still looming, and there were big groups at check in. Nope, none of these were excuses for the team at Mandarin Oriental.   We were grateful for a swift check in, doing all the additional but necessary steps, safely and quickly. There was staff all around to help anyone waiting, to make sure things are well within control. Good job, truly.   The room was superb. The view of Marina Bay was to die for!

"An Average staycation, a notch away from being a fan.",Mrdelena,"I have heard a lot about Mandarin Oriental and have high expectations on the brand but have never had the opportunity to stay in the one in Singapore. Hence, using the rediscover voucher and promotion showing on MOSG’ website, I’ve decided to spend one night with my mother to experience the luxury and renowned ‘fan experience’. We decided to opt for a 2D1N stay at the Marina Bay View room. I have to say that the experience was not quite up to expectations and somewhat disappointing.  We arrived at the driveway via cab and there was no one at the driveway to welcome us or to show us the way to the entrance. The ‘warmth’ element was clearly missing already, and I always believe that first impressions always matter. As we walked into the main lobby and after doing our safe entry…",3,January 2021,

Average only family staycation,chiachiang,"We stayed one night in the Marina bay view room on a Sunday check in. Check in was smooth at 130pm and we got the room without much waiting. Children were given folded balloons.  The room is clean and spacious, Marina bay view is great. Housekeeping is efficient when we requested for more towels. 2 hour swimming pool usage is sufficient for the family as it was raining most of the time. I did not use the gym. Breakfast is at the melt cafe served to our table. While there is variety the quality and taste is poor. The staff  The set dinner included in the room package is decent.

Not keeping up with times and not vegan friendly.,Nonochin81,"We stayed here on Christmas eve for a night.  Furniture is dated. We felt like we were living in the early 90s. We stayed in room 1824. There was damp smell in the standing bathroom, even though after bath, the smell would go away for a while. Hotel is still using plastic bottles for drinking water which is not environmentally friendly.   Before we stayed, we wrote in to request for vegan options. The staff told us that there was no vegan menu and the chef would cook vegan meals for us on the spot for breakfast. We chose some some hashbrown and  sautéed mushrooms and tomatoes from the sides. The sautéed tomatoes tasted so raw and the mushrooms seemed like applied with a layer of oil and pan fried for a while.

Amazing Stay!,Noob123," The stay is an experience in itself.  It's not just about getting the software and hardware right, but really doing the utmost to serve the guests. I think all guests regret when they have to check out.  The property has gone through a few rounds of upgrades over the years but it has been so nicely and tastefully done that you don't really see the old and new parts.   The room feels larger than most hotels you will find in Singapore. We got the city view and it was definitely a sight, both night and day. Nicely appointed, it has every thing you need for a comfortable stay. If you need anything additional, housekeeping is just a call away and they usually deliver things up around 11 minutes (yes, I measured :p). The default pillows are way too soft, but housekeeping delivered…",5,January 2021,

I want to specially commend Wai Kei, who took the time to explain the cocktail menu at the MO Bar on 21 Dec evening. There was so much passion during her sharing. We were astounded by how the cocktail menu came about. Bartender John was extremely friendly too. Thank you for the complimentary drinks given in addition to our cocktails.

Below Expectations,Desmund,"To start with, initially we booked 3 nights over the Xmas period 23-26Dec. Knowing is going to be a mad rush hence we decided to check in 22Dec to avoid the crowd ( staying an extra night ) which worked perfectly. The lobby not only dimly lit but almost feel unwelcome. The water features is not lighted and running all day long. During this festive period, no pipe in music can be heard which make it even more depressing during this down time. You feel much relax in most MRT Stations in the morning rush hour. Entire hotel air is stale as few reviews already mentioned. It is ridiculous that guest are allow to book the pool slot prior to staying. This system is totally stupid which MO might want to look into that.

The check in process was smooth. When we arrive at the lobby, the concierge was proactive and took our luggage to the room. The staff were friendly and professional.

"Second time round, disappointing ",SFMQ,"We held our wedding at Mandarin Oriental Singapore 10 years ago and decided to revisit the hotel to celebrate our 10th anniversary as we had such a great experience back then. However we were left sorely disappointed even though we had indicated during our booking regarding our special occasion.  Check in was swift with no issues. Kathya/Kathryn was there to assist and she queried if we were celebrating any occasion to which we reiterated. She went to check the system and mentioned there has already been something special planned for us. So naturally we had our hopes high. We also requested if we could have an upgrade but it was not possible due to full occupancy. Fair enough.   Upon check-in, there was no decor or anything special done to the room.

As Fans of MO, it does come with certain benefits which we could request for during our reservation (eg early check in & late check out) but that aside and given how 2020 has been, they really have out-done themselves this time.

We stayed for 2 nights, and glad we did. Though it rained in the afternoon, we had time to try out the pool too.

Fantastic in this period of pandamic,jillie,"Check in was a breeze! I was so afraid I might end up queuing for hours as most hotels encountered the previous weekend but this was simply amazing. I literally walked in and walked straight to my room (considering there were no prior arrangements for staggered check-in etc). The lady with the Japanese name was simply amazing, she would have roomed me I believe, but she just walked me to the lift (and ensured I've got my parking coupon beforehand). And that time I knew already this staycation was gonna be fantastic.   Got a marina bay room and I could just sit there watching the view (and the pool, which unfortunately I couldn't get a slot for the both days, didn't occur I should check reviews here first to book earlier).

Superb staycation,Samk2012,I decided to treat myself to a 3N staycation to celebrate a big birthday and could not have picked a better place to do so.  From the minute I arrived I was made to feel like a VIP by every member of the MO team.  Luxurious room with a bed so comfortable I was reluctant to get up each morning.  Great breakfast options each day although I did feel that the staff were very over stretched at times.  My family had arranged a high tea in my room as a birthday surprise which was absolutely delicious and the treatments at the spa were outstanding.

THE Best,valerie_lsw,"It was an incredible experience we had as we held our wedding at MOSIN on 12Dec2020 in the Garden Suite. Food from Chinese Banquet Kitchen team was amazing, service by Kang Le and Alice were exceptional. Kang Le was super professional, executing the entire dinner flawlessly. He was assisted by Alice who was so attentive to our needs, proactively checking that our drinks were topped up and that we had warm tea to drink throughout the dinner. (and that I don’t trip over the train of my gown)  Roger, whom we signed the dinner package with, was extremely detailed to explain all points to us. He acceded to our every requests very professionally and was prompt to respond to our queries via email and texts even when he was not on duty. Tim was patient when we met for our AV testing and…",5,December 2020,
Awesome staycation and great service!,csm0512,We went there for a staycation to celebrate my partner's birthday. The service from the staff was great and they were quite attentive to our needs. We were able to check-in early and also allowed a late checkout. Our room was the Ocean View King Room and it had a really good view of Marina Bay. Food and drinks at the MO Bar are also delicious and service from the staff there is great. The Spa might be small but the the massage is guaranteed to relieve you from your stress.,5,December 2020,
Family Staycation,Vacation613498,"I read many wonderful reviews about MO and had probably set too high an expectation for our stay.  Most of the staff are really friendly and attentive but service level is mixed.  1st morning during breakfast one of the waitress overheard my toddler asking for more blueberries and immediately offered a bowl to her. 2nd morning when we requested again, another waitress offered a plate of mixed fruits to be shared instead.  The main purpose of our trip was to celebrate our elder girl’s birthday which we informed the hotel beforehand.  It was thus quite disappointing that there was no balloon setup when we check in when I read so many reviews gushing about it.  A cake was delivered when we returned later in the night.  The wrong slippers addressed to another guest was left in our…",4,December 2020,
Wonderful- will definitely be back!,Melody,"My husband and I brought our toddler for a staycation at Mandarin Oriental and we just checked out a couple of hours ago. Will we be back? YES!  After reading the horror check in stories for other hotels over the weekend, we were rather afraid as I don’t think we can wait even more than an hour with a fussy toddler. To our surprise, we could check in EARLY. Without waiting more than 10 minutes. Already a wonderful start!   We booked the Ocean Grand Room and it was very clean. View was good and my toddler loved looking at the vehicles zooming past. It was beautiful at night as well. Only problem we had with the room was that the shower wasn’t working- only extremely hot water came out. We weren’t comfortable with people coming in to fix due to the current pandemic situation so we…",5,December 2020,
Awesome place and service for wedding & ROM!,desmondtyong,"We had our wedding lunch and ROM at MO Singapore in Nov 2020. The service provided by the staff, especially Elaine and Juliana who is very patient and friendly in explaining all the processes, details and helping to ensure that everything goes smoothly on that day. It was such a pleasant experience that both me and my wife had a great time and doesn't need to worry about anything cos everything has been taken care of by the staff. The location beside the pool is also a fantastic place for ROM with MBS landscape as the backdrop. It is very romantic and nice to have ROM, reading of vows and exchanging of rings.   The wedding lunch is also very nicely decorated and everything went ahead smoothly. The food is awesome so much so that the guests were all complimenting that this is one…",5,November 2020,
Perfect Staycation Experience,Xin Hao,"Booked the Ocean Grand Room and Marina Bay View Room for a 3D2N Staycation in December 2020. Fantastic promotion and value-for-money - each room booking came with a complimentary breakfast and 3-course dinner set.   Waiting time upon check-in is extremely minimal, receptionist was superbly helpful, friendly and accommodating - even offered me complimentary valet parking service and gave me a good overview of what I can expect during my stay.   Both room has gorgeous view of the Singapore Flyer, MBS, and CBD - absolutely amazing at night too! Everything was very clean, well-stocked with refreshments, and also super spacious. Bed is so comfy I could fall asleep almost as soon as I lied down. Toilet was huge as well with a bath-tub.   Meals were very delicious as well at Meltz Cafe…",5,December 2020,
Exceptional service,Kwanda76,"I wanna give positive comments on my 3d2n  stay, between 11-13dec(room 2130). Food and service were prompt. the room view was amazing. All staff provide excellent service but There are few staff I would like to thank for making our stay here memorable.  Mat(hope I get your name right), the concierge staff would give lollipop but also ballon sculpture for my kid when we arrived 3:15pm on 11 Dec.

Nice customer service,komododee,"Our family had a good staycation at MO.   Breakfast at melting pot was well managed, despite the crowd. All the staff from the lobby, to MO bar, reception, Melting Pot,swimming pool and housekeeping, were warm and sincere. The room was also well maintained and view was wonderful!  One hiccup was access to the pool. We didn't realise booking for pool access could be done b4 check-in and found out upon check in that all slots were reserved throughout our two night stay :( Would have been good if it was highlighted at point of booking we should do our booking b4 checking or just allocate slots to all guests anyway?",4,December 2020,
Small dinner reception and stays. Dolce,Fong L,"First when we approached MOSin Elaine the sales for the banquet attended to us, she was very attentive, efficient and helpful.  Towards our event she asked us to coordinate with the event manager janet,she ia very detail and we missed out things and she pointed out to us. We are fortunate enough to have things pointed to us as our reception is small and we don't have any wedding organisers.  And Kang le the one helping us throughout the banquet, he was helpful, resourceful n efficient, especially with our last minute requests and oue unprepaeadeness.

Pool & MO bar were highlights,SayYang,"Kids enjoyed themselves at the pool- there is a small 0.37m deep wading pool for young kids, a shallow pool with in water pool loungers, and a 1.2-1.4m main pool. We had booked our pool slots few weeks prior to our stayca to avoid disappointment, so had no issues getting our slots. The famed MO bar is top notch, with a good selection of bar food to match the interesting cocktails. My favourite is the Milkyway - whiskey, oolong, brown sugar. The Sarimanok is insta-worthy - rum, mango, citrus.",5,December 2020,
Great Service & Location for Staycation!,ZWY,First time staying at this hotel and loved it. You can feel the warmth of the staff and customer service is on point.

"Awesome staff, awesome stay!",Derek Wee,"People are the most important assets of any company. This is so much more true as the staff here at Mandarin Oriental was extremely helpful, graceful, courteous, and flexible.   I stayed here for 2 nights as a fan of MO. Despite the many Covid restrictions, during my stay, it did not felt any less enjoyable. In fact, it felt even more personalized.  Before my stay, I received an email from one of the staff to ask if there was anything I required for my stay.  On the day of my stay, I received a WhatsApp message to notify me of my room availability. Even the breakfast which was alar cart buffet style had very excellent service from the staff.  Overall stay was pleasant and I look forward to my next stay with them.",5,December 2020,
Absolutely Perfect Staycation!,mic_leow,"Everything was perfect from check in to check out. We had a City suite which is spacious and definitely very comfortable for a family of 4. They even added two complimentary extra beds for my two boys when I only expected 1 to be provided.  This is definitely greatly appreciated!  Suffice to say, we all had a good night sleep!  Pool reservation is for 2hr slot and is great as some hotels only offer an hour of swimming time. We had our dinner at the Melt cafe which was included in the booking. Food wise, nothing outstanding.  However, we received such impeccable service from Alex ( if I remembered the name correctly ) . Breakfast was delicious as compared to the dinner. Service was attentive and good too.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay! ",5,December 2020,
Great staycation,DrJLo131,Just finished a 2 night staycation at Mandarin Oriental. The staff was courteous and friendly. Jessica at front desk was superb. I would say she was the best staff we had met at the hotel. Always so smiley and chatty. Said hello to us. even when she was busy with other things. She even remembered our previous conversation. That's the kind of service one expects from 5 star hotel service crew.   Staye at the ocean grand room if you manage to book one. The view there is to die for.,5,December 2020,
Relaxing staycation with great service,Yeo Teck Cheong,"In the midst of the COVID-19 situation, managed to arrange a staycation at MO.

Every wedding banquet should be held here! (especially during covid19 period),Joel T,"Imagine our stress when we heard that Singapore was going into Circuit Breaker (lockdown) 7 months before our wedding, banquet numbers changed to 50 pax three months before our wedding, and another change 1 month before our wedding.  MO went all out to ensure that the concerns my wife and I had were addressed, and made sure we were not short-changed at our end. They followed the Safe-Management Measures (SMM) set by the govt very closely, and helped alley the fears of our banquet guests. On the wedding banquet lunch day on 22 Nov, Alice went out of her way to help my wife (the bride), my mother and my mother-in-law in small little details. She even helped cut the food for my grandma! Alice realised I needed warm water, so she ensured that was always a glass on standby in the VIP…",5,December 2020,

Million dollar views with the warmth of home,Kel,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a night to celebrate her birthday. We chose Mandarin Oriental for this special occasion and we were not disappointed. Right from check in, we were treated to their warmth and hospitality unlike other top end establishments who tend to be a little standoffish. The staff were genuinely helpful and happy to see us and to ensure we enjoyed our stay.  When we entered the room, we were treated to a panaromic view of Singapore icons of Marina Bay Sands, Art Science Museum and the Flyer. The room itself was claasicly tasteful and elegant and we never felt more comfortable.  The hotel's location was another reason why we chose it. Shopping and dining were a stone's throw away with so many malls nearby. We took a leisurely stroll to MBS before dinner and…",5,December 2020,
Excellent family staycation,stiLLtInkIng,Booked the staycation to celebrate son's birthday since we are not able to travel during the Covid-19 period. A Big Thank you to the Guest relations team for their special arrangement. Was even more surprised to receive a card with photo mailed to my home 2 weeks after we checked-out.  My ocean view room was awesome with the flyer and MBS as backdrop. Highly recommend!,5,November 2020,
Not suitable for vegetarians,Johannes,"We booked a 2D1N stay including breakfast and dinner. We called ahead to inform the hotel of our dietary requirements (vegetarian) and they said they will make sure there is something for us to eat. To our disappointment the only vegetarian dinner options was pasta with tomato sauce - which I can't really consider a dinner option when I am staying at a Mandarin Oriental. Pasta with tomato sauce basically means there are no vegetarian options, and even though we had called ahead, the hotel didn't take our dietary requirements seriously. The disastrous dinner experience continued at breakfast, where there was a vegetarian curry + prata option. Usually I love eating prata for breakfast but this one was clearly a frozen prata that was just put in the toaster. The curry tasted like…",2,November 2020,

We Highly recommend our coordinator Ms Juliana Tan as she did a very great job!! She’s very nice and prompt in replies and if there is any issues she will be the first to respond and settle it as soon as possible to give us an answer which is good as she is very busy herself. She is also concern about us even after the dinner banquet to make sure that we have a memorable wedding with the hotel and even go to an extra mile to settle our dinner arrangements. Would like to say a big thank you to her help as without her we do not think that the whole process will be as smooth! Once again , THANK YOU JULIANA!!!  Zuo Dong & Xue Li",5,December 2020,
Excellent choice for family staycation,ClaraT,"Love the little touches that the hotel have for our family. The little ones were surprised with mini bedroom slippers and handwritten note. We were also treated to a cake from the hotel for my boy's 5th birthday - a super delight for him.   What worked for us as parents was the detailed follow through the staff had for our package with Kidztopia, making sure our desired slot was secured in advance and giving us the tickets on arrival.   On the physical facilities, the hotel's suite is very spacious, making it comfortable for 2 adults and 2 children. Rollaway beds were set up in advance, making it hassle free for us.

We were able to check in early and the process was smooth. View from room was great. Had a relaxing time at one of the cabanas - good for lazing around even if one doesn't swim. Ala carte bkft at Melt was adequate though could have more variety.  The late check out the next day at 6 pm was great, plenty of time  to do nothing and just enjoy the ambience.

Let me congratulate too the concierge department of giving an outsntanding service Mr. Howard, I remember him when we enter the lobby and he was so approachable and very friendly. Uncle Chan, who is very helpful in giving his hand for every help he can make. Lastly Ms. Sy who is so energetic and witty who even guide us to our room. She even asked us if we need anything else before leaving. I wanna mention the pool as well, it was fantastic! The view was perfect in every angle! Mhelo did a great job!

Delightful staycation,Ayql28,"I very much enjoyed my staycation at Mandarin Oriental. The room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands and seaview. Happy with the bath tub and well appointed bathroom. The staff was friendly from the front desk, Melt Cafe, MO Bar, Cherry Garden and to the concierge/door man staff. Housekeeping was also efficient in getting items requested. Special mention to Andrews (I think) for checking the bill and making things right, Sun for lugging my luggage down the staircase to the car park, and Joy from Cherry Garden for the great and attentive service given during my lunch. No turn down service and air con was a bit weak - otherwise the stay was perfect. ",5,December 2020,
"Excellent service, wonderful stay",Alison K,"Booked two nights' staycation to celebrate my birthday. Balloons and cake welcomed us in the room. Was also given coupons for free drinks which we used at the MO Bar. The package came with free 3-course dinner each night, which we upgraded to the buffet on the second night with a small top-up. Both dinners were very good. Service from the hotel staff was excellent throughout the stay. If there was one complaint, it would be that the beds are too soft, almost like floating on water beds.

Staycation in Mandarin Oriental,CheskaD,I have to admit I expected highly of this place and yet they have exceeded them. One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in with a staff that goes above and beyond.

Good but can be better,Christian Family,"Had a staycation with my kids to celebrate my wife's birthday in advance and it was great that the team at Oriental provided nice balloons and a delicious cake which made it memorable. Overall it was good but some minor improvements would have made it even better. Requested for firm pillows but i think they did not have sufficient to go around and hence didnt have a good rest. During breakfast (which i think they could be running a little tight on manpower during peak hours), my boy's porridge didnt come with you tiao and my nasi lemak didnt come with achar. We didnt even realised our meals were short of items until we saw the table next to us. Breakfast had less variety due to COVID.

The room is very spacious and the view of the bay will leave you in awe.    The only downside is that the beds and pillows were too soft for our liking but we had great sleep nonetheless.

My First Stay @ The Mandarin Oriental!,engineers12132020,"I have booked the Epicurean Package online and was looking forward to my stay at Mandarin Oriental Singapore. My room was ready when i arrived about 1pm and was greeted by a friendly Receptionist - Gabrield who checked me in professionally. Being a weekend, the pool, spa was fully booked but I managed to use the Spa on a Sunday morning for 30mins. Khim was great, friendly and informative. Artinni at The Melt Cafe was friendly and professional. I enjoyed my stay and I will be back again!",5,November 2020,
Great Staycay!,tanl695,"Had a staycay over the weekend with my girlfriends and we loved it! We had a blast at Nerf (which was part of the package) and the breakfast at Melt Cafe was great. The location is great too, Marina Square is just next door so it was very convenient to get food. The bed was comfortable as well and the view from the room was perfect. Didn't manage to book a slot for the pool though as it was fully booked. Overall, it was a great stay to relax and recharge. Will return again. Highly recommended. ",5,November 2020,
Great staycation,Wander_Girl7,"Stay was very nice. Room was clean and spacious, view was lovely. Staff at the Melt Cafe was attentive and accommodating. Location was convenient, easy stroll to sights and shops. Check in and out was a bit crowded.",5,November 2020,
Wow ed,Ashlyn,"We had a wonderful stay at MO for my husbands birthday on 30 Nov . Checked in by Jessica , she was very eager to help and managed to get the room early on that day. We were roomed too 2037 with a ocean view and was surprised by balloons and cake set up by the front desk. Later in the day when my kids return from lunch Shannon prepared some shaped balloon twisting which made them really happy. Housekeeping made arrangements for kids slippers which was really cute comes in pink and blue. During breakfast although there was many people it was well organized and food was prompt. The lady who served us called Ko if am not mistaken was very accommodating to our request.  We’d return defiantly again.",5,December 2020,
Top Staycation Choice!,grimjo,"We had a 2D1N staycation at Mandarin Oriental to celebrate a birthday, and boy, was it one of the best birthdays ever!

Staycation with family,HUSSEIN AKHTAR,Indeed perfect destination for a family staycation with spacious huge room with a perfect additional bed for my Son & a nice bathroom with bathtub.  The 2-3 minutes walk to Marina square can get you too kids zone and a quick bite at the subway. The hotel pool is set up amazing for a nice swim relaxation in tents while the kid can continue playing in the small river type pool.  Best was since i was looking for halal options they offered a continental breakfast option that made our staycation complete as we did not have to worry on what should we opt for breakfast. Loved our stay !!,5,November 2020,
Excellent Staycation,Weiie_Lee,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Mandarin Oriental from 19-20th Nov 2020. Customer service from the time of booking, to check-in, to the duration of our stay impressed us thoroughly. For example, when I had made the booking in Sept 2020, the guest relation officer automatically enquired if I was celebrating a special occasion (I was planning a surprise birthday celebration for the boyfriend!) and offered a birthday cake immediately. Check in was seamless on 19th Nov, and when I entered the room, guest relations had not only remembered we were celebrating a birthday,  but had done decorated the room for a birthday and had delivered a wonderfully delicious chocolate birthday cake. No prompting was required! I was thoroughly impressed that they had remembered even though I had made the…",5,November 2020,
Wife's bday celebration,Resort13638960366,"Enjoyed the stay here with very courteous and attentive staff. Room is clean and views are great. Only thing is that the bed n pillows are a tad too soft. Our heads literally sank into it and the support was minimal. Breakfast menu is wide ranging, and food are served warm. Staff's attention to detail is what makes this hotel special. Would definitely recommend it. P.s. If u need more support for the pillow, just stack them as they provide a few extra. Or else, u can always request for a couple more (: Cheers. ",5,November 2020,
"Great place to stay, excellent customer services",Mrs ATS,"Spent 1 night in MO to celebrate our wedding anniversaries!

"Relaxing time, convenient location",Amelia_Mei,"We had a two night stay after our wedding, with the intention to relax. We did have a relaxing time, the bed was soft and comfortable which we lazed in the whole day. Their service was great, from the moment we stepped in till we checked out. In room service was impeccable. We were upgraded to a marina view which boost the stunning view of marina bay sands and singapore flyer. We get to see the sunrise without skyscrapers blocking. Location was very central, near to Marina Bay Sands and the esplanade. If you are too lazy to go out, try their room service or their restaurants which has very good ratings.   The only downside was the poolside timing. When we checked in about 6pm, all their time slots were taken up and we were disappointed! We did not expect that, given that we were…",4,November 2020,
Wonderful staycation,Nicole_eug,"There was a short queue during check-in time but it moved quickly and we were in our room in less than 10 minutes. Stayed 1 night at the Marina Bay View Room on the 13th floor and it boasted a panoramic view of Marina Bay in all its glory. The room was clean and had the usual amenities - coffee, tea, kettle and the bathroom also had bath salts.  Our package included breakfast and a 3-course dinner - both meals were at Melt. Service was wonderful and we enjoyed both dinner and breakfast (ala carte buffet) very much.  Tip: Due to Covid 19, if you are coming from Marina Square, you have to exit via the door near Pororo Park.",4,November 2020,
Daughter's 6 birthday celebration,Qibby,Excellent location! Excellent staffs! We got an upgrade to the ocean grand room and it's the best room i've stayed in SG. Can go head to head with MBS hehhhh.

Unforgettable Staycation at Mandarin Oriental Singapore.,YH Cho,"Our family had a 2D1N staycation at Mandarin Oriental Singapore. The hotel staff really went the extra mile to make our stay a memorable one - from the very warm welcome the moment we stepped foot into the hotel, to the thoughtful arrangements to make our anniversary celebration an unforgettable one. Not to forget we had little ones staying with us, the hotel provided everything that we need - baby cot for infant, extra beds for toddlers, baby bath shampoo, bottle liquid cleanser, in-house slippers, bathrobe, snacks etc. Their thoughtfulness is really beyond words!   The price that we paid also include 3 course set dinner and breakfast at Melt Cafe. The service staff are extremely friendly and the food was really 5 stars!!

Staycation/birthday,Min,"Booked a staycation for 4 adults and a child for a birthday celebration, guest relation team did a great job!decorated the room with balloons and hand written card, very nice touch. Breakfast buffet was served to table due to covid restrictions, despite some orders being messed up and slow due to morning crowd, staff was friendly and tried their best to keep checking up on us if we need anything else, breakfast variety was also ample. Pool with a great view, a must visit! but have to book early to avoid disappointment as there is covid restriction too.",5,November 2020,
Best Hotel with Best View in Singapore!,Tami,"I stayed at Mandarin Oriental for my 3rd anniversary and my husband’s birthday. It was the best decision I’ve had. The room is spacious and clean. But the star of the show is definitely the view! 🤩 I highly HIGHLY recommend the Premier Room with the Ocean View. You could see MBS building all the way to Fullerton hotel. My husband loved the room so much.  Not to mention the hospitality from the staff. They arranged some balloons in our room to welcome and also wished my husband happy birthday. And.. they also prepared a little gift for my 4months old baby. Such a sweet gesture. The staff at the restaurant were also very professional and friendly.  Speaking about restaurant, I would also like to highlight the breakfast menu they have. We were offered with a good spread of food…",5,November 2020,
Feels like second home,Mitchelle666,"We had an enjoyable time in MO hotel as all the staff, from front desk to dining to room service were all very warm and welcoming during our stay. It feels like returning home everytime i got back to the hotel after a day out. Also love how personalize the service has been where they leave handwritten notes and decoration when they know that it is a special occassion for us.   We also thoroughly enjoy the meals (breakfast,dinner) at the hotel. Food was yummy and fresh and the staff always smiley and happy to receive us. We ended our trip with some wonderful drinks at the lounge area at dolce vita overseeing the marina bay area with a wonderful view.",4,November 2020,
I'll be back!,Cs.Q,"Had a awesome stay at Mandarin Oriental. Check-in process was smooth and I was in my room in a matter of minutes (they even granted my request for early check-in).

Will definitely go back for more! - Cs",5,November 2020,
A SPECIAL TOUCH,Danny H,"My wife and I had our staycation at the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised to find a birthday deco on the bed, followed by a birthday cake. It was a real nice gesture by the hotel to make our stay a memorable one. On top of that, the 3-course dinner was sumptuous and the breakfast was fabulous. The bay view from the room was stunning. All in all we couldn't ask for more.",5,November 2020,
"Impeccable service, prompt replies to queries",Cal,"A 2d1n stay in the Marina Bay view room. Id like to specially commend the staff from Room Service, Jack, who dedicated his time and effort to set up the in-room dining table and food. It was such a lovely surprise for my partner! Jack was so sweet and thoughtful to check in with us post-dinner, with a smile on his face despite being so late in the evening.   MO guest relations team has also been so patient to answer all my queries via email since I was planning this stay as a surprise for my partner. Everything went far better than I had expected. Thank you!",5,November 2020,

Warm Hospitality,pinkmer406,"Kudos to Mandarin Oriental for their v polite and well-mannered staff who were excellent in their service from check-in. Thank you to reception crew, Jessica, who was engaging with us and friendly while doing our arrangement of room.   It was pleasant to have had the hotel decorated with balloons for my bf’s birthday and to celebrate our anniversary as well. The hotel even prepared cakes that were sent up to the room right after checking in. The view of marina bay was perfect as well with the strategic location.   Room was comfortable and clean, just that we would have preferred firmer pillows as they were too soft. Nonetheless, we had a good night’s rest and we sincerely appreciated the late check out time under ‘fans of MO’.   One thing we took note was that the Hotel…",4,November 2020,
Great stay,Geraldine H,"We did a staycation to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the stay is good. The guest officer escorted us up to our room at check-in and our room was already nicely decorated with balloons and a complimentary cake. She offered to help us take a photo & then gave us a nice printed copy with a card later.   The service at dinner and breakfast was great too.  While the room might not be new, it’s clean and the view definitely make up for it.   Staff who deserve special mention are Izni and Vincent. Thanks for making this staycation a very pleasant and memorable one.",5,November 2020,
Welcome to 1987!,VincentRicci,"There are so many things that I did not appreciate during my stay at this hotel. Let's start with the bedroom itself. I chose a suite with a living room. The bedroom has two single beds. I had never seen such small, uncomfortable beds with rough sheets. The rollaway bed for my 4 year old daughter was wider. The bathroom is dated with a very small tub. As for the toilet cabinet, it is big but completely empty and covered with plaster on the walls. Another thing that I disliked, the lightings, It is not possible to turn off some lamps. In the living room, there is only one master button to turn everything on or off. So at night you only have two options, watch TV blinded by all the lights or in complete darkness. In terms of service, the staff is very nice and welcoming, nothing…",3,November 2020,
Birthday Staycation,Lydia L,Had a wonderful stay with my best friends celebrating both our birthday.

Quintessential MO Experience,yaya_tansg,"This is our second stay in MO. The first in Oct and again in Nov. The man and boy love the stay so much that they got to stay there again. The premier king room is just the perfect size for the cot and for the little one to roll and roam around. The recent stay left us with better moments as the housekeeping team actively checked in on us. Although it’s pretty strange that the baby cot was left out for both stays but a phone call away makes it easy and quick for the team to react.   I can’t rave enough on the service. Our best and most passionate in-room dining staff, Jason who remembered us because of our funny request to knock on the door gently and for us to setup the table ourselves because the little one is asleep and the parents need some good sanity food. He spoke so…",5,November 2020,

Great views meets superb service,angExplorer,"Thoroughly enjoyed our short getaway here. The  view of Marina Bay from the room is gorgeous and the hardware is well appointed with one of the most comfortable beds I ever slept on.   Breakfast was ala carte buffet with great variety and a really good Roti Prata and Chicken Curry. Alan from The Melt was great too. Drinks at MO Bar is great and is definitely a must visit.  What really sets the property apart from others is the service from Atika, Dayana and Kathy. Highly recommended and will definitely return.",5,November 2020,
Great weekend of fun and play!,ZafirahZ,"We booked the staycation package that includes entry to Kiztopia and everything was smooth from reservations till our check out. The selection at breakfast was great, a good mix of western and eastern dishes. The staff was kind enough to also advise us on the more Muslim-friendly options from the breakfast menu.  The cherry on top would definitely be the swimming pool ;) It's the largest we've been to (in our staycation experience in Singapore) and suited our 4 year old really well, it was a challenge to get her out after our 2-hour slot was up.  This was our first experience at Mandarin Oriental and definitely will not be our last. Coming back soon, wait for us Mandarin Oriental! This time we'll be sure to book a room facing the ocean/bay.",5,November 2020,
Refreshing getaway with a wonderful view,Jolene,"The 3D2N staycation @ Mandarin Oriental was fantastic due to its location, friendly staff and most of all, the view. I had the Marina Bay view and it overlooked MBS all the way with a panorama view till Fullerton.  What i did not like: - Cot provided was way too low to put my child (4 months) into. When asked for a rollaway bed, it was not available. - Carpark was most troublesome as it was not within the hotel and worst, there is no lift, which is most inconvenient for those with prams. However, one of the staff there happened to cross path and insisted on helping us carry all the way down. Kudos to him!   Despite the above, it was still a very wonderful stay and would definitely be back!",5,November 2020,

Attentive to details and staff is caring!,Loh,"We booked a hotel room to celebrate son's birthday. The hotel knows about it and was given early check in and late check out. They also put personalised birthday balloons on the bed and a birthday cake on the table as well. The hotel staff also took a photo of us and developed the photo pasted in a birthday card.   I have stayed in many hotels in Singapore and this hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed. Beside making my son very happy for his birthday, they have a very big bed and toilet with bathtub. The view was superb and was facing the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands!

After we came back from dinner, the guest relations team really surprised us with a sweet handwritten card with a photo of us that they had taken earlier in the room. We were really touched and would like to applaud them for their sincerity and thoughtfulness. The room with the Marina view was fantastic.

Deeply moved by the front desk agent who conveyed comforting words after realizing that this staycation was planned to ease my work stress. It was really warmed.    Back to the stay, our room was upgraded from Ocean View to Marina Bay View, and we were offered welcome drink after joining as a member of the hotel group. The cocktail @ MO Bar was excellent.

Staycation birthday celebrations,dino1963,Had a wonderful stay at this hotel. Initially booked a staycation promotion. Hotel contacted me later to inform me a better 10.10 offer and asked if i would like to change. Celebrated my wife birthday and request for rose petals on bed. This was done beautifully and received complimentary cake and balloons as well. Room was in high floor with balcony.  Was pleasantly surprised as we could check-in 12 + noon. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Make sure you request for complimentary car parking as it will cost $50++ for 2 days parking. Room came dinner but was not impressed with the main course.  Overall every satisfy with stay.,5,November 2020,
Great hotel experience!,Ivan L,"It was my first time staying with Mandarin Oriental, as a local Singaporean I have always heard great things about the hotel but never had the privilege of staying with the hotel until now.   1. The rooms were clean and spacious (I enjoyed a free upgrade to the Marina Bay view Deluxe King Room via the Klook deal).   2. Very personalized customer service, it was my birthday celebration and they prepared balloons and cakes with personalized messages (handwritten) -  very endearing.   3. Check in/out was seamless and fast. Food at the hotel was great, with huge portions and great variety.   4. Free parking and every one I met was polite and welcoming.

The experience was all worth it from the comfort of our own room up to the 5-Star well-trained employees of the hotel.   I’ve mostly enjoyed the pool area where I was able to relax and enjoy the fun under the sun. Next to it, is the Dolce Vita restaurant, an aunthentic Italian cuisine where we had our sumptuous dinner on our first night.   The breakfast selections are well presented and delightful.

Lovely staycation,PLC,Brought my parents along for a staycation with my 3yr old boy at mandarin oriental and we enjoyed the experience. The staff were attentive and my boy enjoyed the trip tremendously as he was so pleased with the birthday balloons they had placed on the bed with his name written on it as well. He is so happy that he has his own fuzzy kids size mandarin oriental slippers as well which is a lovely touch by the hotel to pay attention to their little guests as well. Enjoyed the meals at the hotel and the cocktails at MO bar are good too. The only issue is to try to ask for a better view room next time as they did not mention that there was no view at all (mainly rooftop of suntec city) even though I requested for a high floor room with a view. Otherwise a lovely staycation for families.,4,November 2020,

The little details do not escape you. We really appreciate the warmth, sincerity and genuine care from all your staff.

Best SG Staycation Epicurean Escapade,Ochie,"I'm a fan of MO because of the service standards they provide to its customers. I still believe that it's all in the staff that makes MO have that signature type of service that they provide. Kudos to Andrew (From PH) of Front Desk who first welcome us. Second, to the Melt Cafe staff Ganesan and Faisal..Ganesan very funny and friendly while Faisal is really a hardworking lad but always smiling and really interacts with people imagine we saw him in Melt for dinner then early morning we saw him again then lunch saw him in Dolce Vita wow he is all around!

BEST Hospitality Ever!,Shahirah R,"My husband and stayed for two nights to celebrate expecting our first bundle of joy in a couple of months. We stayed at the Marina Bay View Room on the highest floor (21st) and had the most spectacular views. The service was excellent right from check in to the time we checked out. Hotel was super clean and ambience was great. I have to say that this is by far the best hotel stays I've had.  I could tell that the hotel staff was always finding out ways to wow their guests and make our experience even better than it already was. They were super attentive and paid attention to the smallest details. Although the staff who helped me with my reservation was not working on the 3 days I was there, she had made sure that the room was decorated with balloons and even had a special box of…",5,November 2020,

The Food at Melt was excellence too. My simple suggestions is may be can give a little of your fine hot sauce in a little bowl so we can add more juicy taste on main course - the Beef Cheek / Chicken and Fish too.  Your M & E services is real fast upon attending to a loose towel rack loosen and fix it promptly that's testimonial of Oriental branding.

Probably the best hotel to celebrate a special occasion,Zhang P,"Went to MO to celebrate my birthday and I think it was a really good decision. Despite we are staying in for the weekend, we managed to get our rooms at 12PM without any signs of queues and was given a late-check out of 2PM. On the next morning, we made a casual request if we could stay a lil longer if possible and they kindly gave us a 4PM late-check out, which many hotels couldn't do even if you have elite status.   The rooms are not the best design or quality to be honest, as some of the design is a lil dated and it is a pity that the TV still requires HDMI (which they gave one to every room btw so that's not too bad actually) and no nespresso machine. But I think the view, the luxury and the service (imo one of the best in Singapore) makes up the weak points . Rest assured…",5,November 2020,
Hospitality at its best!,Ysjna A,"Came for a staycation together with other 3 family members and we felt like we chose the perfect hotel to stay. Even during the pandemic, this hotel isn't short of service when it comes to ensuring that their customers feel well and at home.

Will definitely come back to this place soon!",5,October 2020,
Wedding Stay,Desmondoh,"The stay was great, room was well decorated with complimentary red wine and chocolate upon our arrival. Despite the COVID situation, we are still able to enjoy ala-carte buffet breakfast at the hotel just that the food choices are pretty limited.  The hotel gave us a picture and a farewell card to celebrate our wedding again. Perhaps the tv system could’ve been better to allow guest to watch shows online such as Netflix and YouTube.",5,November 2020,
Wedding at Ballroom 1,Jessie,"My daughter had her wedding at Mandarin Oriental. Amid the COVID-19 situation, there were many changes and new policies that we had to adapt to.

The rooms are spacious, clean, and cozy. They even put a baby cot for my 1yr old niece even without us requesting it, which is very thoughtful.

Excellent staff but poor planning and management,Raja,"Stayed 2 nights on Staycation offer with my family. No lift from car park so better to drop off luggage first at the lobby or be prepared to carry your luggage, baby and pram if you carry one like I did. Check-in was very bad as they had a shortage of cleaning staff. Our room wasn’t ready so we were made to wait at the club lounge and offered tea and juice. There were more than 15 families already waiting and few more joined after us. After multiple follow-ups, we were given our room around 6:30pm after waiting from 3pm. They offered us complimentary dinner and late checkout without asking which we highly appreciate.   Poor planning again with no crowd control measures at the swimming pool.

We really appreciated the help of our coordinator Elena who provided us with a lot of guidance and support in the past few months, and kept us closely updated on Covid 19 developments. We don’t know how we could have coped with all the stress and details without her! Tim, Murphy and the rest of the banquet team also worked really hard on the actual day to ensure that the dinner went without a hitch.  The food was delicious, and my wife and I enjoyed our subsequent rest in the luxurious city view suites post wedding.

Great Staycation!,Riley K,"We choose MO as they had a promo recently - it was between MO and another 5 star hotel, and we were glad we picked MO! Included in the offer was a 3 course meal at Melt and late check out at 6pm. These 2 were the what tipped the balance.   On the MO staff, impeccable service at the check in counter and concierge. Covid or not, the service by the front desk was flawless.  The room was clean and our room had a great view of the flyer and MBS.  I loved that pool time is strictly kept to 2 hours and you had to book ahead. This mean no overcrowding and we managed to snag a pod to laze by the afternoon sun.   Dinner at Melt - the food was befitting of their reputation, but we suspect most people were there with the promo, hence the staff were rather overwhelmed. Our bread came after…",5,October 2020,

We waited patiently in room 1538 but decided to call the Duty Manager at 4.30pm to check whether the other room is ready. After waited for more than 30 minutes and received no response from the Manager, I decided to visit the front office check-in counter personally instead. Managed to speak to the Manager Ian and it was already at 5pm and yet we were informed by him that the room is still not ready.

We expecting things to be different of course - pool bookings, breakfast situation etc. But all ran smoothly and was a very pleasant stay. I actually preferred the breakfast (non-buffet style) since now they come to your table to take your order, and everything is made a la minute and served to you. We don't need to walk around anymore. Pool timings are in 2 hour slots which is more than enough time for a poolside cocktail and a dip and a short nap. Also had a nice discount since most hotels are vying for patrons to return.

Amazing Stay.,Siti Zulaikha,"It was a good stay cation with my friends and check-in with Chloe was smooth. Breakfast wasn't halal and thank you for the restaurant for letting us know and also, recommend us the alternatives. However, on the second day of breakfast, we didn't get our tea and fruits even though we informed the staff but looking at the shortage of manpower, we let it go instead.   Other than that, breakfast was of good quality. Also, on the day of our check out, the hotel blacked out and there were no electricity too but the staff at the hotel provided portable light stands at the lobby and Bobby, the reception officer, assured us that everything was okay. Thanks to Bobby, we felt reassured.   Thank you for the great service and I hope business will pick up soon so that you will gain back what…",4,October 2020,
Great return visit!,PhillipP,"10 years after our first stay at the Mandarin Oriental, we decided to return for a short stay while transiting in Singapore. At the time of our visit, Covid-19 was already having a significant impact on the city, which was extremely quiet.  The hotel also felt very quiet, overall.  There were plenty of guests at breakfast and the pool seemed busy, albeit with restrictions, but we rarely saw people when walking around the hotel.  With the roads also quiet, it took us about 20 minutes by car from Changi Airport to the hotel.  We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a room overlooking Marina Bay with floor to ceiling windows and spectacular views. A high floor room is always recommended.  The rooms are a good size, and maintained in an excellent condition.  Mandarin Oriental’s own…",5,February 2020,
Excellent stay for the family,Ken,Great getaway for the extended family. Gym and swimming pool use requires advanced booking due to social distancing measures.

Staycation,sharontZ4732YQ,"Their service is impeccable from the response of the emails to the check out. It was for our anniversary celebration and they were kind to prepare some balloons, cake and a card for us. Although it would be better if they prepared all that before we actually checked in.

The Perfect Getaway,GeraldLu,"It was a getaway for the missus and I after 8 months of working almost daily including the weekends. Her birthday was the perfect reason to indulge and give ourselves a little treat.  But what a treat we were in!  A quick seamless check-in at 4pm on Monday afternoon, a personalised guide and quick tour/introduction of our room overlooking the Bay before leaving us to our own.   The room was extremely spacious and had everything the missus needed, full length mirror, bathtub, lounging balcony and a view for the gram’. The team at MO went a step further and decorated the room with balloons and a cake for her birthday.   Quick recommendations from the concierge and we took a stroll to Marina Bay Sands for drinks at dinner.   Upon our return, we found another treat from the MO team,…",5,October 2020,
Staycation,Khai Shah,"Had a great stay. Loved the hotel in general. Except the ambiance in the lobby was too quiet & dull. A background music could have made the lobby sound alive. The room was neat and clean. The view from the room is incredible. Overall, it was ok.",4,August 2020,
Great stay with Mandarin Oriental :),Chrissyxp,"I was celebrating my partner's birthday and it was really pleasant of the hotel to prepare a little surprise in the room for me. :) I had a wonderful and relaxing stay with the hotel, esp complementing them for the good services provided by them.

Excellent Family Staycation,Maign,"We had a very nice family staycation at the Mandarin Oriental. We arrived at noon time, despite a crowded reception, the staff was able to work efficiently to check us into 2 of the 3 rooms booked.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable, came with a fantastic full view of the Marina Bay.  Breakfasts were beautiful together with excellent services.  Only complaint by the girls was the hair dryer seemed a bit dated, needing to keep pressing its button while blowing hair.",5,October 2020,
Superb Stay,LEO_SG,"My 1st stay at The Mandarin Oriental Singapore was a superb one. The service and the room are impeccable. Check-in was fast and friendly even though there was a queue. The Covid-19 preventive measures are follow thru.   I had an upgraded room which over looking the marina bay and city skyline. It looks so amazing at night. I know this room cost more but i appreciate the upgrade from a nice and friendly Duty Manager, Mike. Many thanks for your gesture. Room of course very spacious, cozy and clean. It has all the amenities uiu need. The pool is amazing too. A nice place to unwind and chill down. I was given a welcome drink voucher as Fan of MO.

"Amazing view, breakfast was great, but service found wanting",TYJ_Oct2020,"Booked a family staycation package which was a rather great deal as typically not able to get Suite at such pricing. Furthermore, MO gave a free upgrade to Marina Bay Suite which has amazing view. Breakfast was good too, where we can order more than 1 main dish. Roti prata is a must-try dish.  However, there were certain standards that can be improved. 1) soap bar in the toilet was past expiry date 2) requested for toddler cot for a 22mo toddler weeks before check in but none arranged in the room during check in. Took 3 calls and 3h later for the cot to arrive but only to find that the cot was set at the high level for infants which is a safety issue. Housekeeping staff came back 30mins later with the correct cot. Found out from another family 2 doors away that they were given a…",3,October 2020,
"Great service, pleasant stay!",Debbie,"My family and I recently stayed at Mandarin Oriental’s City Suite room and it was perfect for a family of 4. The hotel noted that we had a kid with us, and prepared a little gift with a personalised note for her. Even though she was just 3yrs old, she was absolutely thrilled. The friendly staff made our 2N stay better, from the friendly concierge, to the welcoming receptionist. Even though our room had some issues with the air conditioning at night when it wasn’t cold, they had staff on standby to try and fix the issue and make it more comfortable for us.

Great stay and service,Iris L,"All around a very enjoyable staycation here at the Mandarin Oriental with great room and great views.

Their Service Tops it All,mav68,"Stayed at Mandarin Oriental over the weekend. It has been quite a long time I have not stepped foot on this hotel. The hotel is still miraculously able to hide all the signs of aging at the age of 30+, as it opened the door in 1987. The hotel's last renovation probably was done a decade ago and I can vividly remember the hotel was closed entirely for a good 3 months. It was a transformation.   The hotel was designed by the renowned architect John Portman, known for his Atrium lobby. After so many years, I still irresistibly look up the spiral view of the atrium in awe.   The room of this luxury brand is not the largest compared to other 5 star hotels within the vicinity nor the in-room design is the swankiest amongst their rivals, not to name them to protect their interests.…",5,October 2020,
10/5 standards!!!,Jolene,"Can’t stress enough how much my friends and I enjoyed our stay at MO Singapore. The one night stay made us desiring for more as it was so cosy and fun.

Loving the view and swimming pool.,Kio,"The staff were friendly, we got surprise from the MO, the view was absolutely breathtaking and swimming was great, my 5yo was able to play in water on her own.

Specially shout out to Ian Soh for his service... thank you so much",5,October 2020,
Daughter's Birthday staycation,swtquek,"My family and I truly enjoyed our staycation this past weekend at Mandarin Oriental. We were celebrating our daughter's birthday and the hotel surprised her with balloons, a delicious chocolate cake and a cute present from housekeeping. We really enjoyed our time at the pool and eating in the various restaurants. If you plan on eating in the hotel, I would recommend making your reservation at least a week in advance. Breakfast was tasty and generous though a little slow at times but that is understandable considering the extra work required to provide an a la carte vs a buffet breakfast. Overall an enjoyable and relaxing stay.",5,October 2020,
Staycation and proposal,ZLee,"What a wonderful time spent at Mandarin Oriental. After informing the team that I am proposing to my girl friend over the staycation, the staff went out of the way to facilitate my plans.

The check-in process was very swift as the staff shared details our reservation and helped to ensure we make the best out of our stay.   We were then led to our room with spectacular views of the ocean, gardens by the bay and the Marina Bay Sands! No wonder they call this the Ocean Grand room. We also appreciated the gesture to decorate the room for the occasion to celebrate our anniversary~   Lunch at Bar 5 was enjoyable with the very attentive Vanessa attending to us~ mushroom soup was especially delicious!

Wedding Anniversary Staycation,Roy T,"With Covid-19 disrupting the opportunity to travel overseas for a wedding anniversary celebration, my wife and I decided on a local staycation instead. The experiences at Mandarin Oriental has left us both with deep impressions that will be difficult to forget! First, upon booking confirmation, we were given instructions to reserve slots at  facilities like the spa, pool and gym in advance as slots are limited due to safety measures. This was well thought out. Making the bookings for slots was also a breeze. Second, at checking in, Yvonne at reception was very warm and polite and even wished us a ""Happy Wedding Anniversary""! When we were brought to our Marina Bay View room, we were pleasantly surprised to see an elaborately decorated room with flowers, balloons, cake, fruit, and…",5,October 2020,

Memorable Weekday Staycation,Mary-Anne,"We had a wonderful one night getaway in the Marina Bay view room which provided a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay and Singapore River.

Great Staycation,weetzz,Fun staycation! We booked the city suite which has plenty of living space for us to hang out. Swimming pool has excellent scenic view - marina bay.

Exceptional MO Experience,Darren T,"Had a short one night staycation and the experience was nothing short of what I would expect from a property under the Mandarin Oriental chain.   Every staff that I came across from the front-office to the housekeepers and even the gym attendant were welcoming, warm and friendly.   The room is spacious, very clean and well-maintained for a property of that age. The pool had an amazing view of the Singapore skyline and the Marina Bay Area.   Had pre-dinner drinks at the MO bar and was impressed by the fact that every cocktail had its own unique backstory on the menu. Dinner at Cherry Garden was just as impressive with the great food and attentive service. Ala carte buffet breakfast was served at melt cafe with both continental and local options to choose from.

Excellent place for staycation and holding events,Yihaoo,"I held my wedding banquet here, with a short staycation in their Marina Bay view suite after. Experience in MOSIN was fantastic. Staff was polite and attentive, and always have a smile on their face. Amenities like Gym, Pool, restaurants, and toilet were clean. The pool even has tanning lotion, sunblock, or goggles for complimentary guest use! Fantastic speed for room service, and can almost ask for anything and will be fulfilled by the hotel staff.   The room was nicely presented to us, and the tub was prefilled with rose petals upon arrival. In-room dining was also nice. We were lucky to get the marina bay suite, as the night view of the marina bay was just so beautiful.   Overall a fantastic stay and will definitely be back for another staycation.",5,October 2020,

Wow! A surprisingly exceptional family staycation experience,Jenn,"Truly Wow.  MO Singapore provided the best service experience I have ever had in Singapore.  Every staff was exceptional - check in, luggage delivery, cleaning, restaurant, spa.... I had encounters with at least 10-15 staff and every single one was able to easily anticipate my needs without being over the top.    The City View suite was very spacious for our 2 kids and 2 adults.  The beds are soft (which I love), the blackout curtains perfect, the aircon very quiet and easy to use.  The only comment is that the design is a bit dated, but some could appreciate the classic design.  The swimming pool, although not particularly large, has a luxurious layout with cabanas, lounge, and beautiful views of the bay.  I was able to secure spots at the pool easily and spent much of the day…",5,October 2020,
Great view and service slightly let down by old infrastructure,JW19,"Booked a 1 night Ocean Grand King and Ocean View King room for a family gathering and birthday celebration.   Service was consistently good throughout the stay with the highlight coming from the MO bar staff and the front desk officer who took a picture of the family and used that to customise a birthday card for the occasion hand written and signed of by the team. That said, service lapse did occur during breakfast at Melt Cafe where some staff forgot certain orders and wasn't patient when taking orders. Drinks were also not pro-actively topped up and water was never served.   On the F&B front, we visited the MO Bar for our welcome drink and that was easily the highlight of the stay. The staff was thorough by walking us through the background story of each cocktail selected and…",4,October 2020,

Breakfast was great with choices and I was impressed by the staff who brought a booster seat which I didn't request for. Extra miles like this made my boy enjoyed the breakfast better!

Birthday staycation,ileaf,"It was a joy and pleasure to stay here for birthday celebration. The team had decorated with towel decor, balloons, and handwritten cards. Even the kids had bedroom slippers and complimentary face masks addressed to them. There was also a small, complimentary chocolate cake.  The view of Marina Bay was amazing, and location of the hotel being beside a shopping mall like Marina Mall was a big plus.  It will be good if the room had a small stool for children when washing their hands, as well as installation of bidets in the toilets.  We found one small issue with the lighting for sleeping and living area though.

It always feels great to be back at Mandarin Oriental. Staycation here is a regular or almost annual affair since my kids were young. However, the last we stayed here was probably 3 to 4 years ago as the kids became teens, they aren't as keen in staycations anymore.   After not visiting for few years, the feeling of sweet nostalgia swarmed us when we enter the hotel. Everything is still the same and seems so familiar. The cheerful and friendly staffs at the reception were always eager to serve. Aisyah, a pretty and cheerful lady checked us in and brought us up to our room.   The Marina Bay room view is superb.

Wonderful time celebrating Babymoon,SHan,"My husband and I had an excellent stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore. It was our last time on a “trip” before our little one arrives, and the entire stay was a surprise by my husband. Izni who assisted us upon arrival was really friendly and had escorted us up all the way to our room (that was allocated near the lift, which I am so grateful for cause I’m 9 months pregnant and walk at a very slow speed). Inside our room was balloons decorated across our bed beautifully hand drawn by I think the Guest Relations Team “Happy Babymoon” which was so sweet. She also offered to take a picture of us that later was printed on a card with words of appreciation from the Guest relations Team.

Been to a few 5star hotels in Singapore but Mandarin Oriental leaves a special place in my heart. My family had a great time, thanks to Mike and the team. Will be again soon.",5,September 2020,
Below expectation,Keith,"I love staycations, especially at hotels in the Marina Bay area. This was my first stay at MO, after experiencing the other nearby brands previously. I will say I expected more. MO us more expensive then some of the other nearby hotels, so obviously I expect a little more. In the end , my conclusion is that only the marina bay view is worth the money. If you are staying in the city view, it’s not worth it. The room itself , though aged, but it’s ok. The service itself is cold at best. The concierge is quite horrible. The elderly gentleman in red costume is fine, those in suit looks more like secret agent, and never ever open the door in the multiple times I walk through that same main entrance. The service at the restaurant during breakfast ranged from average to horrible.…",3,September 2020,
Staycation - Birthday Celebration,Kristine,"Booked for two nights for a friend’s birthday celebration and the experience was awesome! From booking the room to our departure, overall the staff were very helpful and patient about all our requests and queries that surely made our stay enjoyable!  Just a few comments to note.. Upon arrival in the hotel, entrance seemed really quiet and we didn’t feel welcomed by the other staff who was in front of the other door. Then Mario came shortly who was  welcoming and friendly and even offered to bring our things. We also had a pleasant check-in with Bobby who also assisted us to our room. Our room’s view and location, fronting the Marina Bay, was spectacular and just what my friend had envisioned for her birthday! Of course, a BIG shout out to the guest relations team who helped me…",5,September 2020,
Staycation within a Covid framework,Woon T,"My family cannot travel overseas and decide to do a staycation in Mandarin Oriental (MO). There are many hotel options available but at the time of the booking, MO seems to have the best deal.  The package is for a 1 night stay in a city suite for a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids). It comes with breakfast and also a free activity in a Nerf (the shooting toy) play center in the attached Marina Square shopping mall.  The check-in process is smooth. I think there are more staff than guests when I checked in at around 3pm. During check-in, I was told that I was upgraded to a Premier City Suite!  When I was shown the suite, I was blown away at the huge size. It also comes with a pot of tea in a traditional Chinese tea set. This was unexpected and a pleasant surprise.   The family…",4,September 2020,
BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER,Diana,"We checked in last Sept 26 to celebrate my birthday. I booked 2 days prior my bday, so I thought everything will be messy, but to my surprise upon our arrival the ambiance changed everything. From the receptionist who enlighten me for all of the promos, all of the complimentary with all patience. It was like she’s really happy on what she’s doing. I want to rate staff Princes 200/100.   The food, the pool, the bar is SUPERB!!  The hotel is already perfect but what makes it stand out to other hotel I’ve visited before was their staff. I don’t know how you selected good staff but it’s really good for your business. My friends saw my posts and review on social medias and they’re really excited to visit and try MOSIN.

Excellent and refreshing stay!,JMP,"Booked 2 nights under the luxury breaks package. Arrived at 2pm and the room was ready. Aishah at check-in was very warm and accommodating, accompanied us to the room personally where it was decorated with balloons along with a delicious chocolate cake. The view from the Ocean View Room was spectacular, you could see the flyer and MBS and even all the way out to the sea (we were on the 20th floor). Was pleasantly surprised by Jack in the evening when he delivered chocolates and a birthday card with a personalised photo on it.  Due to covid, the pool slots had to be booked in advance. But we faced no issues with this, even when I changed timings on quite a few occasions. The pool is clean, sizeable and tastefully designed.

The kindness of people working in the hotel was amazing, our room with all the little details, (a cake for my husband birthday, colours ballons, sleepers for my daughter, fruits, even a superhero girl mask!) with great views was great. As we became Mandarin Oriental members, we could choose a wellcome cocktail in the terrace looking Singapore Bay, we choose Mandarin Sling, delicious! And the views...The ambience in the pool made you feel so in holidays, you really get to disconect from the outside world. The views from the swiming pool is also amazing.

Aircon was powerful yet quiet, bed was so soft and TV was huge and clear. Unfortunately the bathroom was a little dirty and shower facility was rather lacking.

More than expected,Jason SIM,"MO Rooms are not fantastic if you compare to modern hotels but one of the key factors to hotel excellence is their services and MO did exceptionally well. They literally service you from the moment you reach their doorstep. We had a training-duty-manager, Bobby, that checked us in. He was polite, cheerful and insightful where he guides you through the whole process from documentation, recommendations and directions. Moreover, we casually asked about wedding setups and he immediately pulled out MO and his own contacts for us, walking us through MO's offerings. In short, I remember MO because of Bobby's service excellence. Not to undermine the rest, because every staff was impeccable in their attitude and gracious in sharing their enthusiasm.",5,September 2020,

Awesome Staycation with the Famiy!,C4618ANjeromec,"In summary, there are no words to decribe this experience. I like doing staycations to experience hotels standards, services, facilities and I must say, Mandarion Oriental (MO) tops it. Albeit, the hotel is not a new one but the interiors are well maintained and furnished. The food quality is great as well although it will be good to have more variety of food for the breakfast buffet or perhaps a different menu on alternate days. This would give the hotel stayers more choices to try out the MO-quality food.  BUT what impresses my wife and I is the service level of the staff and the management team. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay over 2 nights, interacting and engaging the staffs with smiling faces throughout.  Below are some examples which I like to highlight and commend the MO…",5,September 2020,

Everyone in the hotel was so accommodating and thoughtful. The hotel itself was perfect, from the pool with the perfect view, the super clean room, and the restaurants with amazing food! We even had the chance to try the short tour around the area, which was truly an exciting way to explore Singapore. Shoutout to Ms. Sy and Sir Rolando from the concierge who were so cheerful and who made us feel like i’m celebrating my birthday with family.

Staff are quick to meet your needs, even prior to the trip they were quick to reply my emails. Generally friendly to guests, especially toward children. Service is highly efficient.  Would highly recommend if you're planning for a family trip, caters to needs of children and babies.

Each time I visit MO Bar, the staff delivers excellent service from recommending food and drinks, checking in when our drinks are running low, giving complimentary drinks and snacks, to small details like taking good photos of the group. We also had a nice chat with the guy at the entrance Rolando who helped us find and get into our car. It's good to get a Dining Society card which provides discount and racks up points for each visit. I'll surely be back.",5,September 2020,
Amazing Stay - Can’t wait to return!,Gniyis,"Easily one of the best staycations I have had. View from the room was lovely. Service was first class - staff paid attention to even the smallest details. Gym was well equipped and staff stationed at gym was able to help teach the proper use of gym equipment and correct form. Thoroughly enjoyed the food at MO - breakfast at Melt was easily one of the best hotel breakfast I have had. Though not as extensive as pre-covid times, selection was enough to satisfy. While the Nasi Lemak was the star of the breakfast buffet, the omelette and sausage were delectable too. Dinner at Morton’s completes the staycation - loved the steak, wine and the chocolate lava cake. Really enjoyed chilling by the poolside with poolside snacks. What more can one ask for? 👍",5,September 2020,

First Rate Service Staff,Tony,"After some initial hiccup with my reservation, a Ms Jessica Elsaputra took over and that made all the difference!   When we arrived, she took care of our every single need and made an effort to know my kids’ names. She was knowledgeable about every aspect of the hotel including the recommended dishes and drinks of different restaurants and bars. No detail was too small for her. Other staff which exemplified the M.O level of service included Alex, Giruba and Mr Stalin at the poolside. They were all welcoming and made sure the rain didn’t spoil our fun at the pool.   Just one small feedback. The gym hark back to the 80s. With the emphasis on fitness now, the gym could do with much more space and modern equipment. We also felt that the breakfast service was a bit underwhelming.…",4,September 2020,

Amazing For Family Staycation,DanTapouT,"Stayed for 2N at their City Suite with wifey and two boys. From moment we check in to check out. Everything was excellent! Not one flawed was around.

A welcome fruit basket was given when check into the room. As well as a milk bottle sterilizer!! We really didnt expect that.

The hotel is located at a very strategic position, for almost all fireworks that happen around the Marina Bay Area, as there are other rooms facing the different positions.   One of the items that I hope the hotel can improve on, will be the internet connection. During this stay, that does not seems to wow as an end user. Other than that, the rest are great ! Including the food at the restaurant (cherry garden) and MO bar.",5,August 2020,
Not Up To MO Standard,John M,"Checked in today as part of a short “staycation” during COVID-19. Pre-arrival service was excellent, despite the information on available benefits through the website being inaccurate (the service team addressed this well). Unfortunately the first day has not progressed positively. Sadly minor, but consistent issues take away from what should be a great experience. Check in is super slow - even with all the booking information submitted online - and on arrival you are given a schedule of what is or isn’t open in the hotel (restaurants and bars) - this is frustratingly completely inaccurate as randomly discovered when you find the poolside bar has always been open all afternoon (the schedule itself and the concierge / reception staff state it’s closed). Rooms are fine if a little…",2,August 2020,
Staycation,Prissyjo,It was an anniversary celebration. It happen that it is during this covid period where we can't travel. Hence we booked MO for our celebration. It was above our expectation. Will definitely come back and stay again.,5,August 2020,
Reasonable property but lacked the warmth of staff,CookieMonster1818,"Rooms were clean, design a tad dated. Food was good. Staff lacked the warmth and welcome. Preferential treatment for other guests. Requested for a high floor and was granted (right above the floors for people on SHN). ",3,August 2020,
Good hotel but Very slow wifi,Jry,"While the hotel has its charm, in my opinion, it’s due for a renovation. Service staff is generally very polite especially Ms Jihah(hope I got the name right!) at Dolce Vita and Joy at Cherry garden. Both gave exceptional service at we feel extra welcome. The executive lounge was closed through out the long National Day weekend and only opened on Tuesday. We understand this arrangement could be the government measures during this period but its strange when it closed during peak season and opened only when most guest are checking out. I could not enjoy the lounge much and have to leave soon after breakfast. I think might as well not open it. The spa, pool and gym is good. But abit disappointed when the spa closed on weekday before our checkout. Another issue is the wifi. While…",3,August 2020,
Not worth the price tag,LSK,"1.shower room too small even for an average size Asian.  If your body size is anything larger than that,  then good luck to you.  You won't be able to maneuver around.   2. Bed is too soft. People with back problem or not used to soft bed shouldn't stay in this hotel.  The bed just sink down when you lie on it.  It doesn't provide adequate support for your proper sleeping posture.   3. They don't provide sufficient food options for vegetarians.",2,July 2020,
Excellent Staff and Room,Curiosity264342,Staff from Room Service and Technical Team is extremely helpful and reponsive. I really appreciate such warm attention and quick response to my request.

"just wow - world class service, great location, all round just great",nigel s,"there is a lot to like about the MO - the pool is one of the nicest spots in Singapore, its central to most things, and the food is all excellent, with good choices in the hotel, and 2 malls right next door with cheaper food options.  but the customer service is just exceptional - nothing is too much trouble, the staff (somehow) seem to know your name on the 2nd day there, and really do look after you.  TOP TIP - join the MO member program (for free) and get freebies to make your stay better.    One of my favorite places to stay in the world, and not pretty reasonably priced for what you get.

Incredible Stay - Upgrade to Club Level,Megan E,"Our stay at the Mandarine Oriental far exceeded our expectations.   We highly recommend upgrading to a Club room, the service we received from Matthew was exceptional and we have no doubt that majority of our great impression is due to him and his commitment to making our stay the best it could possibly be.

Got a ocean-view room at one of the highest floors.. Lovely view!  Big room, excellent amenities.. Room was very well equipped with all the amenities you would expect of a luxury hotel - no complaints there. Room furnishings were lovely, and carpet was very clean! Only thing was the ceiling light was a bit faulty, flickered on and off intermittently and wasn't the most responsive on the switches - but wasn't too much of a bother to me.  Hotel facilities - lovely pool with excellent view of the Marina Bay skyline. The pool itself had beautifully tiled mosaic bottoms, with marble sides.

Jewel in the crown.,Alex Lindsay,"We stayed for 3 nights and every aspect of our stay was excellent. Our room was lovely, with a huge bed and the most amazing view of the bay. We had to drag ourselves away to go out! The staff were delightful in all areas of the hotel. Breakfast was so extensive it was really difficult to choose from all the delicious options. We had Room Service on the evening we arrived. The meal was excellent and the lady who delivered it was charming. We also ate in the Cherry Garden and were served by Joy and Joshua. Again, an excellent meal and service. The Mandarin is so well placed for walking to all the local attractions. When we visited, Singapore was in the 2nd month of CV19 restrictions.

Had an incredibly relaxing experience staying at the comfortable city suite! I wish to compliment Abigail Foo who is assistant sales manager at MO Singapore. She is very friendly, helpful and wonderfully approachable with my requests.  This is a super good deal as we paid $388++ to stay in a suite which is very spacious! This is inclusive of breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children, complimentary drinks at MO bar and 4 tickets for massive play nerf gun experience at $38 each. We have complimentary parking coupon too at Marina Square.   Love the hotel and staff service is excellent! Will be back again.",5,March 2020,

The pool also suited the kids with a shallow section right infront of the beds where we could enjoy a drink and keep an eye on them.  The drinks and food are a expensive but seem to be in check with most upmarket prices in Singapore.",5,March 2020,

Conveniently located next to a shopping mall with a great view of the Merlion,Ken Ip,Mandarin Oriental hotels are known for their excellent service.  This one in Singapore is no exception.  I stayed here on two occasions.  The last time I was here with my wife and son.  Our room had a great view facing the Merlion.  The inside of the hotel has a full height atrium from ground floor all the way to the roof.  All the rooms open into the atrium so the hotel gives off a very airy and bright feeling.  We visited the hotel pool with our 5 year old son.  The pool is big and is suitable for families with children.  We had a great time playing in the pool.  For dinner we ate the dinner buffet which had a really impressive selection of seafood and other dishes.  There was just so much food.  All the lobsters and crabs you can eat.

Reliably great,GerryOz,"We’ve been here many times over the years but the last visit was a few years ago and I’d forgotten just how good it is. Staff everywhere are competent and friendly but the the Oriental Club lounge staff are exceptionally good as it the lounge. Well worth paying for a club access room for all the benefits the lounge has to offer.  Melt Cafe is misleadingly named, it is a huge restaurant that has a vast array of cuisines to chose from on the buffet, all well prepared. The DimSum at Cherry Blossom was excellent. Rooms are very nice, especially Marina Bay side.",5,March 2020,

Splendid. Memorable. Best decision ever,Lynn.L,"The stay in MO was immaculate. Me and SO spent a single night at the ocean view room and never looked back.

Best stay in Singapore,Martin B,The hotel is located directly at the marina. From here you can explore the whole city by foot or public transport. The view from the hotel is spectacular. The room are spacious and quiet and offer everything you need. The hotel has one of the best hotel pools in Singapore. Breakfast is good.

The Oriental Club is money well spent,fg7506,"My wife and I spent 6 nights in the hotel in a King Club room which had terrific views out over the marina.  The room, as you would expect in a 5 star hotel, was very well serviced and immaculate.  Initially we were a little nervous about visiting Singapore with the ongoing Covid 19 outbreak which seemed to have hit Singapore quite badly initially.  Our nervousness was misplaced, the country seems to have a grip on it and the hotel had in place heat monitors so nobody entered the premises without being checked on their way in.    The concern over the virus has undoubtedly impacted on the hotel and occupancy rates are very low, this was a double edged sword as it meant the public spaces were missing the vibe you might have expected, the up side is that the pool area was never…",5,March 2020,

We had a light supper in the cafe by the pool and the food was really nice and came with a complimentary drink -Singapore Sling which was a nice touch.  Breakfast was in the Melt cafe, which had a very impressive choice and the omelette made to order was excellent.  We also took a lovely afternoon tea in the bar and it was beautifully done with an Easter theme.  Also must mention the Fan of the MO Sidecar experience with Simon, which was great fun.

The breakfast buffet was emmense, I've not seen as much choice anywhere even on a fancy cruise ship. Whilst it was mainly self service, you could order specific items freshly cooked.

We chose a Marina Bay view room and was not disappointed with the views from our room. While we had not stayed at the chain our expectations were high and the quality of the rooms, lobby and concierge areas, pool and restaurants did not disappoint.   The most impressive thing for us was that although the hotel is over 30 years old it did not show it and had clearly been well looked after and renovated where needed.  The number of restaurants and quality of the food was especially good and although we only ate their once the great variety meant we were not struggling for choice.

In the club lounge : Louis, Elle, Xui Fang, Rio). The food at breakfast and in the lounge was delicious.  Why I gave 4.5 and not 5 : The corridors are dated (new carpet and wallpaper are needed).  We complained about a flickering light and the toilet (the water did not stop running after we flushed)  but it never got sorted out.

The most amazing view,Stephanie H,"Booked a club floor room and the view of the marina was amazing. I could see Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Flyer from my large bed! Room large, pool beautiful and club lounge has free flow 'til 10pm.  An added bonus was a late check out at 4pm.  They catered well and provided GF food for us too.",5,February 2020,
24 Hours of Pure Luxury,Anson,"Private check-in, Champagne, Freshly shucked oysters and a panoramic view of the Marina Bay Area. My 1 night stay at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore has been pure luxury. As a Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite guest, I often default to Marriott properties due the complimentary lounge access, upgrades & late check-out etc. However, I have always wanted to stay at The Mandarin.  When we arrived, we were assisted by a dedicated staff manning the entry and exit points, checking our temperatures and offering us hand sanitizers as a safety precaution due to the Coronavirus outbreak happening now. It was comforting to know that the hotel has various measures in place to ensure the health and safety of the guests.  We were then checked-in by Ee May in the lobby at about 1817Hrs. We were…",5,February 2020,
"Gorgeous hotel, great location, wonderful service",Sri V,Stayed here for a family holiday. Wonderful view of the bay and the evening light show from our city suite. The staff were wonderful.  Delicious and ample breakfast with several cooking stations - the Singaporean food one being my favourite.  The pool was divine - great poolside service too.  Easy to get to all the main sights of the city.  Would definitely recommend staying here!,5,October 2019,
Excellent Service,Siglo,"This is a relatively old hotel compared to the many new ones in Singapore. It has a small lobby focussed on check in and check out with a concierge desk on the ground floor.   I used the Club lounge facilities and therefore check-in was in the room which was quick and friendly. The lounge on Level 19 is very comfortable with many places to sit with sufficient space between tables to enable private conversations which is rare in some lounges. Breakfast, lunch and tea/cocktails are served and the quality and variety are very good. The staff are experienced and make you feel very comfortable and relaxed and they can handle most issues easily. All quiet and discreet.   The bedroom is of the old style and therefore small. However, its well maintained with plugs and sockets all in the…",4,February 2020,
"If you are a non smoker don’t visit this hotel,",Denise Eades,In most ways this is a top class hotel but it falls down on its rules for smoking in public places. The Pool bar serves food and drinks AND also allows people to smoke which is appalling. Non smokers are confined to a few meagre tables under the eaves of a nearby building . Nowhere else in the world would this happen in a 5 star hotel! Non smokers are given minority status where smokers are allowed a free hand.  As a world wide traveller I Have never experienced anything like this before and would never visit Singapore again without checking this issue of smokers dominating public eating areas!,2,February 2020,
Beautiful,afisher63,"Staying in the club lounge we were presented with a superb level of care by a team lead by Andrew , Matt and Elle. The rooms very comfortable , whilst the lounge , with high ceilings and lovely furnishings was an oasis from the humidity outside. The staff constantly  checked to see if you were fine in an unobtrusive way, whilst no request seemed to trouble them. We had previously been to the Marina Bay Sands a few times , but felt that the mandarin oriental was able to provide a more personal , less crowded service. This will certainly be our home when in Singapore going forward . Thanks you",5,February 2020,
Short efficient biz trip,balimermaid,Lovely hotel and well managed. Great location but only let me down on 1) breakfast quality and 2) a ridiculous system of no credit for being a Fan of Mandarin Oriental member because my secretary booked and paid  on Expedia as they forbid credits to accumulate if paid via a 3rd party....I would easily visit again but might need to sort out some kinks...,4,February 2020,
Wedding Banquet Dinner,Ella,"Our wedding dinner was held at MO. It was fabulous, our family and friends thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful view, setting, delicious food and the amazing service that Elizebeth Ong and her team provided.

Wedding,Sherman Yeong,"We held our wedding in MO Singapore. It was one of the best choices we made. We were blessed to have nice and good coordinators (Lynette, Ivy and Zann) handling us. Grateful to have them help us plan for our special day. Food and service were great! Kudos to Banquet Manager Murphy and Chef Tan and the rest of the banquet staffs! Guests thought we upgraded the menu which we didn’t. Everyone enjoyed on the day itself! Thumbs up!!",5,February 2020,
Singapore Stopover,Michael R,"My recent Wife and I were on our honeymoon and stayed at Madarin Oriental for 2 nights on our way to the Maldives.  The staff at check in were great and walked us into our room where we had a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival which was a nice touch.  The hotel is in a great location and all services were fantastic, from housekeeping to Bay @5.   We have decided to definitely stay there again when we return!  Highly recommended and thankyou so much for your great hospitality!",5,February 2020,

Attentive staff, really good offering of bars and restaurants, spacious rooms with fantastic views. Lovely pool! We will stay here again if and when we return to Singapore.",5,February 2020,
Perfect stay!!,Stephk,"Absolutely AMAZING!! The staff is very friendly and helpful. I loved the towel and water bottle as I came back from my daily morning run. It was very sweet that they’d run back to the valet station to have it for me as I ran around the corner to the hotel. The concierge always checked before we ventured out if we had enough water for ourselves and the kids, if we needed an umbrella for some shade, maps etc. Great location within walking distance to many sites such as the Marina, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, museum, Gardens by the Bay and various shopping malls. Pool is fantastic with comfy loungers, cabanas, lots of towel stations and a sunscreen station in case you forget yours. Highly highly recommend!!",5,February 2020,
"Great Staff, But Everything Else Gets a Thumbs Down.",Serial_Traveller,".  On a month long trip around Asia we had expected the Mandarin Oriental Singapore to be really fabulous, it is after all billed as a Luxury 5* hotel. It was certainly the most expensive. Yet it was the biggest disappointment. And despite paying for the Oriental Club Level and one of the larger scenic marina views, it was the smallest room we’ve ended up with in a hotel in years, with a midget sized bath.   The layout of the hotel itself is also unappealing, like a car park with a vast central atrium where you look upwards to see every floor, almost prison like. And unlike some other MO hotels, this one had no grand lobby or seating area. In truth, they are more interested in hiring out parts of the lobby for conferences and weddings, which you can easily mistakenly walk into.…",2,January 2020,
ELEGANT Hotel with the BEST Breakfast buffet,Sandra U,"The Mandarin Oriental is a glorious, elegant hotel.  The lobby is gorgeous.  The room was gorgeous.  The service was elegant and efficient.  The best thing is the breakfast buffet at the Melt cafe.  This is the most spectacular breakfast buffet I have ever seen.  Western, Asian, Indian, Sushi, Dim Sum, custom omelets, baked goods, are all available in a dizzying display.  The breakfast buffet is laid out in multiple rooms of elegant seating.  There are too many choices for any one room.  Everything was delicious.  I loved their Dim Sum selections.  I tried small serving of the Indian curry.  Come hungry and ready to experiment with a universe of cuisine choices.  We got the fourth night free offer which made this luxury hotel more affordable than the Marina Bay Sands.  We spent…",5,January 2020,
In love with Singapore,Marisa H,"First time in Singapore but not our first time staying at a Mandarin Oriental and I got to say the service was excellent as always, the attention to detail is incredible we always had drinking water and fresh fruit in our room. The service at the lounge always amazing the staff knows how to make you feel at home. Thanks to Andrew, Jaya, Princes, Rio, Elle, Nicky, Xin Fang & Matthew. We had a great time in an amazing and unique city and we also got to celebrate lunar new year. Hope to go back soon!",5,January 2020,
Mostly great,Seamus44,"We were here for the weekend and, as one would expect, the hotel felt more suited to business travellers than a family holiday. Service was very good and efficient, but sometimes lacked warmth.  The breakfast buffet is one of the best I’ve ever seen - vast choice and exceptional quality.  The pool is great, complete with day beds and a view over the bay. Although the life guards were quite authoritative about what not to do - eg my toddler son and I were playing with his croc sandal in the water, floating it like a boat, which was not allowed.  Nice rooms with very comfortable beds, even if the room felt small with a slightly dated bathroom.  The Mandarin Oriental in some ways seemed very committed to sustainability and their environmental practices, for example by providing…",4,February 2020,
Perfect start to our honeymoon,Jophie3105,"We had 2 nights in Singapore before moving onto NZ on our honeymoon trip so we decided to treat ourselves to a little luxury! We’ve been to the MO before for cocktails when visiting Singapore in the past so we knew of the hotel and their excellent customer service. We received a gift of a bottle of wine, chocolates, fruit and a card congratulating us from the management team so that was lovely, and top of that two free cocktails which we had at the MO bar. Their mixologist is mesmerising to watch and the drinks are delicious.  We had an ocean view room on the 16th floor overlooking MBS and the view was pretty spectacular. Breakfast is incredible - anything you could ever imagine is served! Definitely worth it.  If you have an evening flight they offer a concierge serve and a…",5,February 2020,
Greatly Satisfying Hotel with Good Service,Zen Yoshi,"Everything was perfect- reception desk, restaurant and bar, housekeeping, doormen, accommodation and amenities. We were totally satisfied. We particularly liked Melt Cafe. Everyone at Melt Cafe was very kind, friendly and attentive. Throughout our stay, we were very much satisfied with their service. We’ve been particularly impressed by the service offered by Alex Wong, Assistant Manager at Melt Cafe. He was extremely kind and helpful to us, and made our experience at Melt Cafe a memorable one. He is definitely one of the key elements that motivate us to consider coming back to Mandarin Oriental again on our next trip to Singapore. Another good thing about this hotel is that it’s connected to the shopping mall, and you can walk to MRT stations via the mall.",5,October 2019,
Mandarin Oriental - Of couse it is great,WhenMylesandI,"It is the 5th time we have stayed at this hotel, like its sister hoteld it ticks all the boxes.

Over the top!,tannsx,"This is my 4th visit to Mandarin Oriental Singapore and this hotel never cease to impress me.  This trip is quite different as i travel with my 4 y/o girl who has anaphylaxis which is the severe form of food allergy. I'd been in contacts back and forth about food preparation because i need to bring frozen cooked food from home to be reheated each meal. The hotel is soooooooo accommodating and we feel warm welcome there. Melt, the breakfast buffet is so splendid. My give my special thanks to staff who always offer to find gluten free treats for my kids and the chef who cooks special gluten free fried rice for her every morning.

Best hotel ever,ViennaMichael,"We stayed 5 nights for a business trip but actually Mandarin Oriental and their staff made it feel like vacation. From check-in to check-out, the people of MO really made the difference.  Always greeted by name we felt special throughout the day. No question, rooms and public areas are well kept, elegant and still cosy. And while other hotels in Singapore always feel busy, it feels calm and relaxed whenever entering MO.  The pool area is just the best, perfect Bay and Skyline views, great landscape and service. Whenever coming back to Singapore, MO is the place to stay.",5,February 2020,
Wedding and hotel stay,JulietL929,"The MO team - led by Elena, Jasmine, Jegan for our wedding banquet - made our entire wedding planning process smooth and stress-free. The team from the Chef, to the AV manager, to the couple’s butler showed so much dedication and pride in doing their jobs well. They were unfailingly attentive to our needs and to details large and small, and were an absolute joy to work with. We couldn’t have asked for more in a team. We were equally satisfied with our stay with them and felt very pampered by their attentive and thoughtful service.",5,February 2020,
Return to perfection,Paul D,Had a wonderful stay at this hotel 5 years ago en-route to Australia so didn’t hesitate to rebook for another 3 day stop-over in Singapore during our honeymoon adventure in January 2020. I’m delighted to say that it was another perfect visit. The hospitality was wonderful. (I did miss the birdsong but understand why it is no longer!) I’m quite particular and cannot fault this hotel or their wonderful staff. We had a club floor room with a view towards the bay. Wish we’d had time to take advantage of the motorbike tour. Next time!,5,January 2020,

Beautiful hotel – poor housekeeping,Mlappa,"This Mandarin Oriental Hotel is not up to the standards of others in the hotel chain where  I have stayed in the past.

Best Service in Singapore,Marcus S,"As a fellow hotelier with a genuine interest for luxury travel I have stayed at many luxury hotels throughout the years such as Park Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, W, St Regis etc. etc.   But I must say that this was taken to the next level. Starting with the arrival with a very personal and professional welcome and in-room checkin by Charissa. A great room with the most stunning view. All of this was perfect but not what made our stay so special.    The reason why you stand out is because of your staff. During our first breakfast, the host Nancy greeted us by name (don’t know how they managed to know my name the first morning…) they gave us a tour of the breakfast area and made us feel very welcome. All encounters with Simon at the concierge desk was above expectations. He managed to…",5,January 2020,

Singapore visit,Gwg123co,"Thanks to Mandarin Oriental for their kind service during our recent stay.  Charissa in Guest Relations took special care to help us get oriented to the city and plan our visit.

I can’t say enough about the service and hope to return again someday!",5,January 2020,
Great hotel in the heart of Singapore,Beach connoisseur,"Stayed at the MO for a few days before heading to the Maldives. Wonderful location close to the gardens, shopping and restaurants. Enjoyed the 'Mother of Dragons' cocktail at the Mo Bar and the pool overlooking the bay. The only negatives was that this is a conference hotel, so many people staying here for work conferences. Also, requested early check in as we traveled over 23 hours from LA and was not able to check in early.",4,April 2019,
Transit for 4 days quick Singapore tour on foot.,Vishant N,Excellent welcome and staff from and club level were extremely courteous. They accommodated my checkout for 830 pm with a small fee.   I really appreciated that since my flight was at 1150 pm.   Mandarin oriental has lived up to its distinctive service and looking forward to my other stays at MO.  Location was excellent  I walked to China town/ lau pat/ Mustafa center/ bugis/little India/hajj.   It was a great calorie burner. Did it all comfortably in 2 days   3rd day was sentosa island.  Safe thanks to the strict laws.   Even the two guys I saw in a rare sight sleeping under stairs asked if I needed help with directions.....real help not shady help...lol,5,January 2020,
A taste of luxury at the heart of the city,Pathfinder652108,We visited the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights in January 2020 and stayed in a Club room on the 21st floor overlooking the Marina Bay.  Our room had a stunning view across the bay and was very comfortable and well appointed.  The Club lounge facilities were excellent and we made good use of the refreshments available.  All the staff we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful.  The hotel is very well located to visit many of the tourist sights and shops with easy taxi availability to reach those not within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again when returning to Singapore,5,January 2020,
Nice view than the Marina bay sands,InhwanOh,"Mandarin Oriental has nice view to bay side rooms. If somebody wants rest in the Hotel, It will good choicees.

As we would come back to Singapore in the end of 2019, we read about several hotels. In the end, we decided to choose once more to the Mandarin Oriental and opt for a clubroom with harbour view. After a night flight, we were picked up at the airport early in the morning by a taxi of the hotel. A very clean Mercedes and an extremely friendly and knowledgeable driver. Upon arrival at the hotel, a lady was waiting for us down at the entrance and told us our room was already available. Ofcourse that was a big plus for us. She did the check-in in our room at the 21st floor, while we enjoyed a cup of tea and the awesome views over Marina Bay. The room and the hotel are very well maintained, but for us…",5,November 2019,

The staff are warm and very helpful. A fantastic stay ",5,January 2020,
Great Location Supported with Outstanding Service.,Kevan L,"Returned to Singapore 25 years after our last visit. In that time there has been some tremendous changes with the Mandarin Oriental being surrounded by new hotels and attractions.  Some of these may have modern decor but the MO still has class with superb and outstanding service from its staff, even when they are at their busiest.  This service starts at the very front with the doorman's greeting when he opens the door of your taxi, and continues through to all other areas of the hotel.  We stayed in a club room with fantastic views over Marina Bay. If you can afford the club experience it is well worth the extra. The location is in easy walking distance to some of the main attractions and shopping areas.  We would like to say a special thank-you to all those who worked in the…",5,December 2019,

The Best ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,alicin99,"From the moment we arrived & the moment we departed this hotel we received nothing but the best service from everyone at this hotel. We chose this hotel for a three night post cruise break over New Year. We had never stopped at a Mandarin oriental before. I wasn’t expecting it to be up there with Four seasons hotels at all. How wrong we were our expectations were absolutely blown away. This hotel was way better. The welcome we received from the moment entered was exceptional. It was 9.00am we had been on a 12 hour flight, we received the most warm welcome from the lady on reception she said they have a room ready for us, wished us a happy anniversary, explained how to receive the free WiFi & that we had been upgraded so we had a room with a view of Marina Bay. We felt like we…",5,January 2020,
Pleasant family holiday,Luxfam Traveller,Stayed here with the family. As always great service. Lovely pool area if a bit small. Expensive poolside menu (1 bottled beer S$22)  Melt cafe is amazing. Check in process is very slow. Was supposed to have a room upgrade (as part of the Amex Centurion) but for the second time only had a standard room without a view ( the hotel is triangle shaped with 2 sections experiencing good views) Still a great place for a break with the family. Location is also awesome.,4,January 2020,
Underwhelming at almost every level,Lucien C,"Full disclosure: this was my first stay at a Mandarin Oriental property, so perhaps my expectations weren’t realistic. I assumed it would be on par with a St. Regis, Four Seasons, Ritz Carleton or Peninsula hotel in Asia. It definitely wasn’t in essentially any dimension. Here’s why:  Rooms:  I booked a suite for my family. It was spacious but extremely tired. It has probably been 20+ years since it was remodeled and it looked that way, especially in the bathrooms. I would put it on par with an older Sheraton or Westin property. The beds were also not particularly comfortable.  We had booked the reservation for 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids). They brought in one rollaway bed. I had assumed they would make up the big couch for my other kid to sleep on. Both nights, they left some…",3,January 2020,

The place to be for NYE,Cultural Dascoverer,"We booked a room overlooking Marina Bay for a few nights including New Years Eve. The hotel was a great location to watch the fireworks. During the rest of the year you will also be able to see the nightly light show though this would be better seen from the merlion, a short walk from the hotel.   Breakfast at Melt Cafe was fantastic! The choices available was great...from dumplings, to Indian curries, traditional English breakfast items to Japanese...there seemed to be everything. We also had a dinner at Dolce Vita, the hotel's Italian restaurant. The food was good and so was the service.   The staff are great. Always friendly and willing to assist.

Not a huge fan...,keentraveler30,"I visited after Christmas and stayed for one week total. After staying around 20-30 xs at MOLV over ten years, I was expecting the same level of service, especially because I was staying for one week. This was not the case, unfortunately. On NYE, I called to request housekeeping services, and the manager gave me some serious attitude on the phone, acting like I was making an outrageous request. My check in was poor and sloppy, as the hostess had hand scribbled notes with the total nightly amounts? It was hard to decipher, and I thought-if this is MO, shouldn’t they have a more standard, computerized printout? The pool attendants weren’t very attentive, and when I asked the gym manager if he could turn down the AC, they told me to change treadmills to avoid the vents, but that…",4,January 2020,

Friendly reception -we had late flight on our departure day, so they gave us check out time till 5 PM. Dolche Vita level is amazing with nice swimming pool , restaurant and bar. Outstanding views into Marina help us to survive during long winter months",5,January 2020,
Best way to see New year,Kiwi6969,"Location great. Restaurant plenty on site. Otherwise the shopping centres next door have plenty of eateries. Our room overlooked Marina Bay and has a spectacular view of the rehearsals for NYE. Then the 90 minute display was the best every seen for a New Year. Sydney, don’t believe yourselves that you are the best. Singapore is far better. Great hotel",5,December 2019,
"Great Hotel Experience, Breakfast Buffet Best Variety Ever Seen",Chris D,"Best location to experience New Year's Eve show and fireworks, as you are facing the fireworks and drone show closeup. Breakfast buffet was elaborate and the best I've experienced (and I am in the hotel industry and have traveled to many international hotels), as they showcased Western, Chinese and Indian buffet choices to please a large audience. The most memorable experience was being greeted every morning at the Melt Café by ""Jihan Febrero"" as her big smile warmed my heart and made my boyfriend and myself feel so welcomed - we loved the delicious mango she delivered to our table. You are very lucky to have such a wonderful employee to represent your organization. ",5,January 2020,
WOW - 5* Luxury at its best,Requiresperfection,"WOW WOW and WOW we certainly weren't disappointed, from the minute the very professional and friendly doorman opened the car door for us we were made welcome. All the staff from reception , restaurant, bar and pool deck are incredible, efficient , knowledgeable and friendly. We had a Marina facing room, as we arrived early morning it wasn't ready but the receptionist rang as soon as it was available which was way before the 3pm check in. The view was perfect over Marina Bay which is lovely both by day and night. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in and the room had all the amenities and toiletries one would expect from a 5* hotel. Buffet breakfast with its array of food stations was included. Lunch on the terrace by the pool high above the city was…",5,January 2020,
Great views from high end rooms but let down by poor service,LizaNTrevor,"Our first impression was that the Lobby is too dark and a bit cramped with no place to sit. People were milling everywhere and it gave the impression of chaos. Check In was quick but not particularly friendly. No explanation was given about why we were charged more than our confirmed rate, nor was any explanation given about breakfast or the hotel facilities. We were given our keys and told where the lifts were and that was it. We were tired so we went to our room and then realised they overcharged us. So, we went downstairs and spoke to a different person, who explained the extra amount was for an extra night that would be refunded. She also answered our questions about shopping malls near by and the best way to go to marina bay sands, even going so far as to walk us outside…",3,December 2019,
Best view of NYE firework celebrations & Star Island show,Mellfell21,"Stayed for four nights in a suite primarily for the NYE celebrations. This was our third hotel in a 10day stay in Singapore & we loved it. The view from our room & balcony, Room 1101 was spectacular with MBS as a backdrop. The hour long firework show on NYE with 500 drones from Star Island was off the scale.  We loved the MO Bar with its fabulous vibe & inventive cocktails, the pool area with cabanas, food & service was fantastic & the buffet breakfast was great although we thought Rise at MBS was better. We took advantage of the free 10min scooter & sidecar ride with Simon which was fun & interesting & very different to anything we'd experienced before. Late check out was a massive bonus for a late night flight. Thanks MO for a fabulous time, miss you already!",5,December 2019,

Great location but overall average,mom2rk,"Our family of 4 stayed for 5 nights in 2 connecting Marina bay view rooms.  The location of the hotel is excellent.  It could not be any better.  The views out of the rooms were spectacular, a true picture window into iconic Singapore landmarks.  Daily breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety.  Breakfast is chaotic - I don't think the staff can support the amount of people and it was hard to get service at times on coffee etc.  The same chaos goes to the small lobby.  The hotel is super busy and it seems to also service cruise ship folks.  Lobby is small with tons of people with no seating or waiting area.  This hotel did not live up to expectation of a Mandarin Oriental.  It was quite disappointing overall.  The rooms are very dated and old (with light switches not…",3,December 2019,
Worst experience in Singapore,magmik06,"First of all , I would like to explain I prefer to write in english to be understood by most people . I would like to specify I’m front office manager in a 4 star hotel so I perfectly know as it work in a hotel ... I booked 2 rooms in direct with the hotel.  We arrived around 1pm and our luggage were taken by the bell boy . At the reception, I asked to pay the 2 rooms upon Check in to avoid the pre authorization. I had only euros and I’ve been told that the reception was not able to change ( Although I read later in their directory they are used to accept payment in currency) and I’ve been asked to go to a machine where some of my bank notes where declined because new ...) we almost spent 30 minutes to Check in .

Great Hotel with Views to Gardens by the Bay complex,BT_Arch2012,"We decided to stay at the Mandarin Oriental since the Marina Bay Sands was quite expensive. The Mandarin Oriental on Raffles is a 70s style twin atrium building with a 3 glass elevator core taking you up to room levels with a common corridor balcony overlooking the fan shaped triangular atrium. The reception staff and concierge are very cordial and helpful. Shout out to Midori for her wonderfully welcome checking in process and explaining the sights nearby and all the important information we needed to visit the Gardens by the Bay. The Melt cafe has a good breakfast buffet with Asian, Continental, Indian and other usual hot and cold breakfast items.

Fantastic hotel.,Richie Lloyd,"Can't fault the hotel, outstanding service. Great room, lovely pool and relaxing area. Hotel has a calm ambience and was spotlessly clean.

Great Hotel,12madijack,Family of 4 stayed at this hotel over Christmas. This hotel is great in all aspects.   We have stayed at many of the other 5 star hotels in Singapore however this hotel beats them all.  The Christmas Day lunch is up there with the finest hotels in the world.

(dont stay their room with XX19 which they called as premium room actually it only worths 2 stars rating) 2nd stay is more dramatic, firstly they cannot find my bookings, again it took 30 mins to check in,and  again they encouraged us to pay extra 160 SGD to upgrade into same room (XX19) which we refused, when we got into the room, we asked them to add extra bed for 5 years toddlers, firstly they said ok later they regretted, that was how the battles and lies start, they transferred me…",1,December 2019,
Not what we hoped for,CamillaDemuth,We choose MO because of a wonderful Christmas we spend at MO in Bangkok. The hotel in Singapore seems a bit outdated and very dark. The pool area is nice and the fitness center is good. The rest is without charm. Feels like staying on a large convention hotel - I will not recommend it for leisure and families. What they served in the club lounge was very nice. The MELT restaurant was very dark and very big.,3,December 2019,
Wedding Dinner at Mandarin Oriental,Nanahoh,"I was fortunate to have both Elena and Zann to organize and coordinate my wedding! These ladies ensured that everything is in good order and tried their very best to accommodate my request! On the actual day, Zann (despite being a very busy evening) came by to check on us and made sure that we have everything we needed. She even had to sprint to find me a new balloon when my baby niece accidentally let go of hers (which she was supposed to hold on for march in).  Murphy was our banquet manager who kept everything according to schedule, ensuring the food and alcohol were sent to to the right table.

Superb location,Zoe E,"Arrived after getting off a cruise ship, we were upgraded for a very reasonable price to a room overlooking the Marina Bay Sands which also included breakfast. We were out for the day but the room was ready when we returned, luggage was a bit delayed getting to us but arrived eventually. Room was lovely and spacious, turn down service and lovely staff. Breakfast the next day was beautiful, excellent staff, loads of choice then we spent the day by the pool which again was lovely.

I don’t think other hotel are able to do like this especially during midnight, unless you stayed there for many times.   My check in and check our process was super efficient and warm; unfortunately I can’t remember their name.   Due to business, I always stayed at the 5 stars hotel like Four Seasons, Ritz Carlton, and Mandarin Oriental. Honestly, MO never disappointing me.

"Beautiful hotel in a convenient location, can be noisy/busy",Maggie A,"You can't go wrong with any MO property with top notch accommodations and service. However, the hotel does get busy and may not be the best options for those looking for a quite sanctuary from the city. The front desk informed us about a convention taking place at the hotel and upgraded us as result. The gesture was sweet but the all the facilities at the hotel were packed (breakfast, gym, pool), which made the trip not as enjoyable. Will definitely go back in the future but will ask if there is an event taking place before I do.",3,May 2019,
I'm headed back to MO Singapore as soon as possible again!,NYKGMGTGSG,"We spent 5 days, 4 nights in Singapore and during the period of the Singapore Marathon. Upgraded to Club Room with Marina view, we enjoyed the room and the Club level. Nice to have the benefit of having breakfast at the Club or in the buffet restaurant and to have dinner if you choose not to dine outside. A centrally located hotel where you feel like you've still have room to breathe, in an urban setting with a beautiful pool and views of the Marina make this a spectacular place to stay.   I enjoyed every minute of our stay, the service is excellent, food and drinks were great! ",5,November 2019,

The Mandarin Standards are once again maintained to a high level.,TonyMus,"The Mandarin Hotel chain is one of the few chains that maintains high standards in every place that we have visited.  The attention to detail is superb and I think that this is the first Hotel that I have visited that even had a stapler in the desk drawer along with two strips of extra staples. To many, this may seem pointless but we were going on a cruise and I had to staple the Cabin numbers around the handles of the luggage !  Everything about this Hotel is superb and there is little if anything I could criticise.

Birthday Staycation - WOW,ltravelsagain,"This was such a memorable stay!  I had stayed to celebrate my birthday and I was very impressed with the room’s Marina Bay view and the courtesy of the staff!   The weekend I stayed happened to have the NDP rehearsals or NE Shows. This meant that I was able to witness the different air force planes and the singapore flag fly past close to evening time. The best part was having the fireworks outside our window! It was magical!   There was also a chocolate cake arranged by the hotel. Thank you!   Another thing to note is, ALL staff from the receptionist, to the In Room Dining staff who sent the cake, to the pool attendant, to the door man. EVERYONE was so polite and welcoming.

"Physical Facility better than expected considering age, but service could be better",LuxuryTravelerSF,"Only stayed overnight before flying home. If given the option, I would probably rate this hotel 3.5 given the $350 USD price tag. This is an atrium-style hotel popular in the 1970s/80s. Our room was better than we expected - no complaints - except that it was too warm and stuffy when we arrived. But, A/C worked fine to cool it down. The ocean view was worth the upgrade too. At check-in and check-out, the receptionists were so soft-spoken that we could barely hear them. I was also displeased by the policy of placing a hold on the credit card that exceeded the agreed upon rate to cover ""incidentals"". Finally, breakfast was mediocre.

Beware - someone might put something in your safe deposit box unknowingly,steammilk,"TLDR:Check the safe deposit box before you stay, even you didn't want to use it. As someone else might put something in that box, and the hotel didn't even care to check it after guest leaving.  Stay here for two nights. Six hours after check-out, got an email mentioning about something I might forget in safe deposit box in room -- which is nice.  Problem is that it's not mine.   I didn't have luggage with me at that moment, so I had to make several calls to friend to check if I forgot something. Truthfully, I've changed few hotels during my long stay in Singapore, so I didn't exactly remember if I used the safe deposit box here.

Very good hotel but a little dated,mbgandco,"Situated next to one mall and opposite the Esplande, the hotel is well placed but not in perhaps the best position in Singapore.  It is only 800m to the nearest station though.  The breakfast is first class and the rooms are comfortable without being oppulent.  Generally the service was very good although room cleaning was very late some days (nearly 4pm one day).  However, the design of the hotel is not great.  The central atrium echos and on a couple of nights the noise from downstairs made it difficult to sleep.  This dated design and the somewhat dated feel to the rooms mean for me that this is a very good but not great hotel",4,November 2019,

And can I just say that the club colleagues are excellent at what they do, especially Louis who is always smiling, Xin who always checks on me making sure I am having a pleasant time and Rio for always being ready to help me with my plans for the day. It was a short stay, but next time, I'm definitely staying longer! Im hoping to make this an annual activity for me to stay at the Mandarin before my yearly family reunions. Looking forward to it! :)",5,December 2019,
Excellent wedding experience @ MO!,A yap,"We held our wedding at Mandarin Oriental a few days ago and it was the best decision ever! Prior to our decision to hold our banquet at MO, we visited several hotel venues. It was a difficult choice but we finally decided on MO mainly because of the wedding coordinator- Ivy Ng! She really stood out and impressed us with her impeccable service, patience and dedication. She was nothing short of amazing! Right from the start, she provided timely guidance and advice during our wedding prep and really walked us through our wedding journey. It is unbelievable how much commitment she has for her job and throughout the planning stage to the actual day, she has been extremely helpful and caring. She made it a point to accommodate to our every request no matter how minute it seemed, had a…",5,December 2019,
Disappointed Stay,Daniel L,"I have always valued Mandarin Oriental brand and expect top notch 5-star service at every stay and so far the brand has delivered to my expectation.  However, this particular stay was disappointing.  Even though the check in process went fine when I arrived at lunch time, I had an unpleasant experience afterwards.  I  proceeded to find an onsite restaurant for lunch after check in.  To my dismay, a Morgan Stanley conference is being held on the same day and they have reserved all the restaurants within the property for the conference attendees only.  I was shocked that hotel guests are not allowed to dine and was stopped from restaurant entrance.  This is the first time I heard that hotel guests cannot dine onsite.  The front desk called the restaurants and every one said fully…",3,November 2019,
Disappointing,Mogana,"First, the view was satisfactory but not super great as much as i expected. In fact, i was asked to upgrade my room for better view by paying extra 30 dollars. I got a room on 12 floor so asked for a room on a upper floor but rejected flatly with one word ""no"".   And it was actually so-so view. Imagine the original room I was going to get without  extra payment? Or was is just some kind of a rip-off for a new guest who doesn't seem to have any idea about view and room condition for just 30 dollars?  What's more, the room condition was not as great as I thought how MO would be. My upgraded room was small. Many parts of shelves were dusty and uncleaned. The Bluetooth speaker was very old, so frozen at first then working very slow. Screen mirroring did not work properly either. The…",2,December 2019,
Excellent services and great room view!,Ching,"The front desk service is excellent! Thanks to Bobby, Dayana and Ee May who assisted us on early check-in request and the great hospitality services provided! The room view is superb which is facing the Marina Bay and Singapore Flyer!

Lovely Staycation,SweetXF,Thoroughly enjoyed my staycation with friends at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore. The swimming pool is probably the best in the city because of its resort like feel. Amazing views from the room and all the staff we came across with were excellent. Would recommend to friends and definitely return!,5,December 2019,
In need of a makeover,Alexandra M,The hotel is quite dated and the rooms are small.  The bathroom is very average. I was disappointed to see plastic water bottles and plastic amenities.  We have a nice view of Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay and the pool looks nice.,3,December 2019,
Great Place for memories,Mich,"Celebrated my friend’s hens night, the stay was great. Reception and room service staffs were friendly, the room was great. They were quick in responding to our requests for glasses and ice bucket.   Even though they had a bluetooth speaker in the room, when we requested for one, they handed us a speaker without questions and with a smile.   It was a great experience. Definitely would head back to Mandarin Oriental for any celebrations",5,December 2019,
Great service and good food,Albert,"We just had our wedding held in Mandarin Oriental and the experience is extremely good. Elena, our wedding planner, Jason our banquet manager, and Chef Tan have been excellent. Elena put in a lot of effort to ensure that our experience was top notch. The food is simply out of this world and most of my guests have plenty of positive feedback as well. I would definitely recommend Mandarin Oriental to the others",5,December 2019,
"Great hotel, perfect location",Anne C,"I visited the Mandarin Oriental with my 3 nieces in October. It was my first time in Singapore and the Mandarin was the perfect hotel.

Wedding Dinner Celebration,Bernicia,"We would like to compliment Elena for her thoughtfulness and always ensuring that everything is running smoothly. Elena and her team has provided us an exceptional service! It was a blessing for us to have her. She always gives us the best deal possible, even recommended credit card deals to us.   We had to bring forward our solemnisation as we have a family in critical condition. When we contacted Elena, she was so prompt in following up and made all the arrangements for us immediately. We also had to book several rooms for our guests, Elena was really nice to give us free upgrade for two of our rooms!   On the day of check in, we were surprised to see a full bathtub of red roses petals. The view from the bridal suite was fabulous. Needless to say, our guests enjoyed the food,…",5,November 2019,
Wonderful Staff and Service,lcplcy,"We spent 2 nights at Mandarin Oriental's bridal suite for our wedding and the experience was amazing!

Never Ceases to Amaze,Bloem Loete,"My family and I often stay at the Mandarin Oriental when we do small trips to Singapore and we are always impressed! The location itself is great, just a small walk to many central points in Singapore and the hotel is absolutely magical. The staff are very friendly and attentive and always willing to help and the facilities of the hotel are all amazing. The dinner buffet at the Melt cafe is one of the best I've had, with options from all over the world.

Amazing wedding experience,xyplox,"My wife and I decided on Mandarin Oriental to celebrate our wedding. Right from the beginning, our experience was a very pleasant one. The sequence of events were clearly communicated, there was sufficient flexibility, and overall the staff were very accommodating.  We'd like to specifically mention the below people who truly made our experience a great one:  Charmaine Aw - event manager, who was consistently on top of things, very prompt replies and exceedingly pleasant to work with Chef Tan Eng Kok - great cuisine, taking care of the special dietary requests of our guests impeccably Banquet manager Kumaran/Anshul - executing the event smoothly and in a very timely fashion Butler Yixuan who helped my wife with the many gown changes and also thoughtfully offering drinks…",5,December 2019,

Fantastic hotel and fantastic staff,ddplymouth,My wife and I stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and have to say it is a fantastic hotel. The facilities and location are excellent but it is the staff that made our trip a truly wonderful experience.  The staff at breakfast in the Melt cafe or in the Italian and Cantonese restaurants were all fantastic. The reception and concierge could not do enough to help. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Singapore      All I can say is thank you to the staff for making our holiday very memorable.,5,September 2019,
Great Hotel & Staff,MashitaA,"Liked the location, warm, friendly and professional service personnel.

Marvelous,Jason Chow,"My wife and I decided to hold our wedding lunch banquet at Mandarin Oriental Singapore after reviewing many different hotels, mainly due to the gorgeous ballroom, amazing facilities and reputed delicious food.   Boy did we get the bang for our buck, thanks to Elena Ong and Roger Cheow from the Event Management team. I was highly impressed by their attention to detail, patience and professionalism - before, during and even after our wedding. They were able to accommodate and respond quickly to any requests we had, which we really appreciated. Thanks to them, we were quickly assured that we were in good hands for our big day.

One of the Best,Danieltwtn,"The room view is magnificent, you can easily see the ocean from your room, as well as MBS and the ferries wheel. The pool at 5F is one of the best in town. Especially during the night, the lights, as well as the view, is breathtaking. ",5,November 2019,

Wonderful service staff and dashing special arrangement by the Margaret J and her team,Anthropy,Margaret J and her team spent more than half an hour working on this special arrangement for my wedding proposal.

I’ll be a happy return customer. :),5,November 2019,
Grand views of Marina Bay Sands and the vicinity,Salz,This place costs a pretty penny and I've been here twice already. That alone should speak volumes of the place. The room and the amenities is immaculate. You're spoilt for choice at the buffet breakfast at Melt . The bar comes with some fabulous cocktails too. Service was not consistently good but I'll let it slide since they tried to make up for it. Appreciate the effort.,4,November 2019,
Perfect stay for my birthday!,elainee821,Posh hotel with an ideal location near the Marina and nearby Metro Station. My club room was spacious and comfortable with fresh fruit and flowers daily.

Spectacular property and even better service,travelfam201126,"We loved our two-night stay at the Mandarin Oriental.  I HIGHLY recommend a “club room with a marina view.”  The club at the Mandarin Oriental is excellent (one of the best I’ve been to) and the marina view is fantastic (view of the marina, the F1 race track, the Marina Bay Sands, the downtown skyline, etc).  We were treated like royalty and look forward to returning soon.  Keith and Jane Carlson",5,November 2019,

Excellent anniversary dinner,Zachary K,"We celebrated our anniversary at Melt Cafe by recommendation and had an excellent evening.  The spread was impressive. Every dish set out was vibrant, well-presented, and flavourful. Popular items were promptly replenished so no guest was left wanting. We enjoyed in particular the crab cakes, bbq pork (extra section found outside!), roast lamb, cheese spread, and chilled seafood.  We were seated at the edge of the restaurant offering us a quieter atmosphere.  The staff who waited our table were pleasant and ever-attentive. They made our celebration extra special with their warm greetings and well wishes.  Towards the end of the evening, we were even presented with a red velvet cake with a personal note to commemorate our special occasion, and a very complementary card.  We were…",5,November 2019,
Beyond Beautiful,Olubukola.S,"My very first time in Singapore and i stayed at the one of the best hotels.This was a work trip and we had to stay at the Mandarin for about 5days. The location of the Hotel is so central, you can easily locate the malls and other tourist attraction. The experience at the Hotel made me want to come back to Singapore. Luckily for us we got the Marina Bay view rooms. The array of food at Breakfast was well thought of.Meeting the taste bud of every ethnic community. The staff from the concierge to the reception was very friendly attentive and willingly to assist at any point in time. So we had a late flight and unfortunately the hotel was fully booked so we could not use the late check out option.

Wedding at Mandarin Oriental - Best decision ever,Amanda,"Just had our wedding on 13/11/19... CHOOSING MANDARIN ORIENTAL WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER!!!   My friend had her wedding 7 years ago and she was raving about MO's service and food. We decided to go with her recommendation coz I've never seen somebody so enthu in recommending her ""hotel banquet venue"" so i know for sure MO must have done something so right that she remembers the experience even till today.   My husband and I finally got to experience it ourselves and all I can say is... YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING. Everything has really SURPASSED our expectations. My guests LOVED the food. Some of them even said the food was the best they have tasted out of all banquets they went. My bridal squad LOVED the service.

Wedding Review,PurrKittyn,"When I was discussing my wedding plans with Elena on my first visit to Mandarin Oriental, it wasn’t my first choice hotel, reason being I wanted a very airy fairy type of bridal suite. However as Mandarin Oriental is a very prestigious hotel in London (my husband is british) I was ordered to scount Mandarin Oriental alongside Shangri La (think London Shard, vs Singapore variant) for the wedding.  Basically I was scouting just to give him an MCQ (multiple choice question) on which location + price point would be our ideal choice for my chinese wedding banquet dinner. Despite the table number being on the small side (15?) But being absolutely in love with the grandiose ballroom with the magnificent chandeliers, I didnt want the smaller ballrooms available for a party my size.…",5,November 2019,

Definitely, there were a few glitches here & there, but which wedding doesn’t. hahha However, you guys were very thoughtful, did your best with everything. Thank you for being there every time I needed something, or even being there when I thought I didn’t need something, but in fact I did. Thank you for helping to keep me calm. Helping with the wine, wheelchair, flowers, much needed coffee, the list goes on Thank you for being responsible, explaining things to me - we really do appreciate that.

Wedding Lunch,JustinOoi,"We held our wedding lunch at Mandarin Oriental (10th Nov 2019), and it was the best decision we made.   The hospitality and service shown from the start to end were awesome. Our event manager, Charmaine, was very accommodating and helped us out immensely by dealing with our inquiries and last-minute changes. Even Zann, who was filling in for Charmaine for a short period was also very helpful, helping us get a last-minute extra room late at night.   The banquet manager, Murphy, and A.V. manager (sorry we forgot his name) was also very thorough and ensured that our wedding lunch went smoothly without a hiccup.

Stopover,Allyl56,"We spent 4 nights here on our way home from Australia and cannot recommend it high enough.  We both said that we wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else in Singapore.  The hotel is beautiful and the food is wonderful, the location is excellent as it is only a two minute walk to the Esplanade.  However the reason it is outstanding is the staff.  They are all amazing and can’t do enough for you.  We love it here. ",5,November 2019,
Fantastic views over the Marina,Helen O,"WiFi - great Pool - big pool area, lots of sun beds. Good service topping us up with ice water regularly, without having to ask which I thought was a really nice touch. Free sun lotion.  Room - good, 2 single beds which were big enough, slightly bigger than a single but not quite a twin. Amazing view over the Marina, the wheel and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on the other side.  Air Con - a bit warm in the room overnight Service - absolutely amazing service Gym - ok size, very quiet, had all the equipment I wanted. Restaurant - we had a free drink voucher each to use in any of the bars except 2, I think there were about 7 restaurants/bars in total to choose from.

Excellent hotel with incredible views of Marina Bay,JoLon,We were greeted warmly and our room was upgraded  (American Express Luxury Hotel Program) which gave us the most magnificent view of the Bay and light shows at night.  Buffet breakfast was quite good and service was outstanding,5,October 2019,
"Great, luxurious experience",Jorn Horaczek,"We decided to try the Mandarin Oriental for the first time just out of curiosity and were not to be disappointed.  At the beginning, I was a bot angry because there was nobody to pick up our bags, but after I mentioned this, the staff made more than up for it and I think it was just a misunderstanding. The room (suite) was very comfortable, spacious, clean and well equipped. The Club Lounge is comfortable and staff are very attentive and try to anticipate the guests wishes. I loved going to the lounge because it is luxurious but not too pretentious. I will come again. ",5,November 2019,
Tranquil Luxury,JRO76,"Everything about this hotel exudes a sense of tranquillity and luxury. The staff are polite, calm and nothing is too much trouble. From extending our Day Room use by an hour for no extra charge to honouring our room request (and giving us a great view of the Marina Bay!), it felt like we were really being looked after.   Pool, gym, bar staff all amazing. I would be happy to stay here again.   Only one downside - the Cherry Garden restaurant was disappointing. Service was slow and inefficient and the menu not very inspiring. However they were very sweet and gave us a free dessert, and fortunately, it did not mare the experience of the rest of the hotel.",5,November 2019,

FIRST CLASS DELUXE,Robert Delcanho,"Overall, after initial disappointment with the size and decor of an ""ocean view"" room we had a fantastic stay here and will return.    Our Ocean View room was small and we felt the decor tired and inferior to similar priced rooms in other 5 star hotels in Singapore we have stayed at.  Mike, the front office manager at the time listened carefully to our feelings, and with admirable grace and courtesy moved us to into a larger ""ocean grand"" room. This room was perfectly sized for us, with exceptional views of the pool area, marina and distant ocean.    Mike was exceptional, but in fact all the staff were quite faultless, and ever keen to assist with any needs.  The breakfast food selection and quality was also exceptional. We had a great Chinese meal too.  The pool area is also…",5,November 2019,
2nd best in Singapore,Vincent Peach,I didn’t want to pay the price for the Raffles hotel and stayed at the Mandarin. We got a great suite with a incredible view for half the price. The suite was beautiful with a balcony. Only complaint was the size of the bathtub which was too small for me. Beautiful pool and spa with sauna!!! Breakfast was great for any nationality.,4,October 2019,
Fantastic breakfast,Chicco2018A,"This is a very good hotel where I have now stayed twice on business. The location is fantastic, just across the water. Excellent for running (if the heat allows!). I particularly liked the breakfast, which has an excellent selection of different type of food and offers the option of eating outdoor.   The swimming pool is beautiful, large and with plenty of sun chairs. The view is spectacular.   Staff is very kind and professional, as expected from a MO hotel.   My only negative comment is that the structure is getting quite tired and might be in need of renovation.",5,March 2019,
As good as it gets,Richard F,"Everything about this hotel is exceptional.  The staff, the room, the restaurants and most of all the location.  You can walk almost everywhere from there.

Brilliant luxury,Julian S,We had a fantastic stay here and will be back.   First the negatives  - the decor in the rooms is a little tired but still very comfortable  And the positives  - The staff were amazing (especially Matt at the club lounge. He went out off his way and I imagine with his people talents and manner will one day be running a hotel like this)  - The food in the lounge was exceptional  - The pool is heavenly with a fantastic array of seating options including free cabanas  - The view from a bay room was magnificent  - the location is central and a short walk to all the major malls  - free Wifi in a club room  - Did I mention the FANTASTIC staff  Recommendations  - A Bay View room  - A club room so you can enjoy the fantastic food  - Lots of free days to lie by the fantastic pool.

Total luxury,lauren15880,The mandarin Oriental is a true luxury hotel. All the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. We were there to celebrate my husband’s birthday and they went out of their way to make it special. The buffet breakfast was the best I have ever had! Great views from our room and the pool area.

Can I extend my stay?,Uncle_KenKen,"This has been another exceptional stay at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore.   The staff were super friendly and made me feel very welcomed. I’m not a frequent traveller to this hotel, yet the staff still made an effort to remember my name and my seating preference for breakfast.  The room I stayed at offers great unobstructed view of Marina Bay and was well maintained despite its age.  The sidecar experience is something not to be missed. It’s a 15min ride around the hotel vicinity and I highly recommend it. All you need to do is to sign up for Fans of MO and arrange it through concierge.  This stay has been so wonderful that for the first time in my many years of travel that I had consider extending my trip so that I can enjoy the MO hospitality for a few more days.

Very nice but expected more,Xavier_Kuri,"Starting with the positives, this hotel has a Great location with outstanding views. We got the marina view room and didn't want to close the shades to see the view all the time. The pool area is also very nice, very spacious and with amazing views as well to the harbor and Marina bay. Service was in general very good, with the staff being super polite, attentive, and helpful. The only unpleasant experience with the staff was with a doorman that helped us to load our bags into the taxi, and although we gave him a good tip for US standards, apparently he was not happy with it and mumbled something that I guess was not very nice.... We expected more of the breakfast, which was a little like smoke and mirrors with certainly a lot of options, but not that great quality/premium…",4,November 2019,
Amazing wedding banquet service,Gabriel Lo,"We made two important decisions that shaped our enjoyable wedding evening on 27 Oct 2019.  The first was getting coordinator, Ms Elena Ong. She has been absolutely amazing in this wedding journey! The best coordinator anyone can have! She really did her best and was very prompt in answering our questions prior to the banquet. I had to make couple of last minutes changes to table arrangements and even carpark lots which Elena happily accommodated. I still remember on our first visit to Mandarin Oriental when we were still selecting a suitable venue to host our wedding banquet, Elena was the one who brought us around and explained the benefits of hosting a banquet at MO and features the hotel provided which were meant to enhance our wedding. I was hooked on MO ever since and could…",5,October 2019,
Disappointing for a 5* Hotel,WandaTwich,"Recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Singapore and while I received an upgrade to a Bay View room with fantastic views of the bay, the room was not properly cleaned and there were several problems with electrical outlets and light switches not working.

Spectaculous wedding with Mandarin Oriental,SHEN,"We hosted our wedding here at Mandarin Oriental and I would say they've the best service.

A short week stay.,Johan B,"As all mandarin hotels, one of our favourite stays. We stayed here 5 days when travelling to Australië.  Just to beat the first jet lag. This hotel is perfect for that. Outstanding service, food is great with a multitude of choice. The location is right in the heart of the city. Everything within walking distance. The room was great, ocean view although that is no real plus as it is stacked with oil and container vessels...  Personnel is really helpfull but english is sometimes poor.. ",4,October 2019,
Breakfast Stuff up,cyc_shot,"Booked through Amex Travel, turned out first night has breakfast, not the second. Checkin rep advised breakfast included. Was given the bill ""half-way"" through breakfast on the second day, what a way to strong-arm patrons to pay up in the middle of the meal, they should advise at the door. Terrible ending to our holiday, this can be easily avoided at check-in and the restaurant entrance. Despite the bill being voided after queuing at reception, explaining the situation and waiting for rep to seek information, bad first impression of the venue.",3,October 2019,
Good location and quality,Daniel J,"It is located in the very center of the city with good views.  You can go to Suntec city and any other shopping malls without going out, all connected.  Staffs are very kind and welcoming guests. nice view in the swimming pool, too.",5,October 2019,

"Very comfortable hotel, excellent facilities and outstanding staff",Patricia R,"The hotel is located not far from the Marina Bay Sands area and from our room on the 20th floor we had a perfect view of the Bay, the Marina Bay Sands hotel and  the surrounding area, including the Merlion. Check in was seamless and friendly, the room was spacious and had loads of room for our multiple bags after nearly 4 weeks away and the bed was the most comfortable we’ve slept in since we left home! The outside pool is lovely and the spa has numerous and very good treatments. The food and drinks at the Mandarin Club level 19 are superb, eg Ruinart champagne, top quality wines and fabulous breakfast and other food throughout the day But what sets the hotel apart from others, for us, is the friendliness and efficiency of the staff.  In particular I must thank VMaati from the…",5,October 2019,
Amazing Marina views,Tanya,"Had such a hard time wanting to leave the hotel because the view here is just stunning. We spent as much time as we could spare lying by the pool both during the day and evening. Wonderful views of the entire city and Marina Bay Sands. The view here at twilight is amazing. Huge selection at the breakfast buffet, loved the variety of Western and Asian dishes especially all the Indian options.

Staying for 6 nights, we were totally impressed by the friendly, engaged and always caring and helpful staff.

Great venue for private celebration,Celxin,"We had our baby’s gender reveal party at Mandarin Oriental last weekend and it was one of the best decisions made.  Our guests shared that the food were good (the laksa was thumbs up! Though many said the carrot cake was a bit too salty.) The Garden Suite is spacious for the kids to run about. I would highly recommend this venue for parties with kids. Thank you to Elizabeth and Katelynn for their time and effort in coordinating the event and relying our requests to the Chef.  To Jobin and his team from banquet, thank you for ensuring that the setup were arranged as per what I have in mind and for ensuring that the guests were well taken care of.

Our bridal suite was awesome, and the service all-round was impeccable. Our wedding banquet ran very smoothly, and all our guests were very impressed with the food & service. There was a huge spread for the breakfast buffet, and the service at MELT cafe was second to none.

I somehow expected more,Adelaide5000,"There’s no doubt that this is an architecturally beautiful hotel and is in a great location. Definitely choose a sea view room for the spectacular views of MBS - you can see the light show each night and the Gardens by the Bay. The MRT is a short walk away through a shopping arcade so you can get anywhere on the island easily   The rooms are not large but are very clean. They’re feelings bit old fashioned compared to their rivals in town. They’re comfortable and the beds are terrific.  We had a single basin in the bathroom.

Organizing a wedding is not an easy thing, but having an excellent wedding coordinator in a superb hotel definitely made our lives very much easier! Our sincerest thanks to Ms. Elena Ong, our super-capable wedding coordinator in MO. From the day we had our first meeting with Elena till the actual day of the banquet, Elena has been supporting us with all our requests and questions. She is unbelievably patient with our never-ending requests and clarifies all our doubts always almost immediately. Without Elena, the wedding wouldn't have went so smoothly and hitch-free.

We were extremely lucky to have met Elena, our coordinator, during MO's wedding show. One word to describe her would be fabulous. Liaising with her was a breeze as she was always prompt in her replies and would accede to our requests patiently. With Elena coordinating the preparations that were needed, we could put our minds at ease.   On the day of the wedding dinner, Jason, our banquet manager, was the man behind-the-scenes pulling all strings to ensure that our guests were well looked after.

Famous and almost perfect,ClaireLVR,"We spent five days with our 1 year old daughter in a Marina Bay grand room. The location of the hotel, the view from our room and from the swimming pool, the unique open air fitness and yoga place, the bath amenities from atelier Cologne, the amazing Dim Sum brunch at the Cherry Garden restaurant and the lunches at the Italian restaurant were absolutely perfect!  The only shadow to notice was the quality of the buffet breakfast.  Staff is very child friendly and there is a small pool for children. ",5,March 2019,

Super Hotel,Jo A,"Wonderful service, very attentive staff. If you can slash out have a room with access to their suites lounge, peaceful and calm after a days sightseeing. Marina facing room is a must so you can watch the fabulous light show across the bay every night. Concierge Service second to none, well informed and very helpful, one actually walked us to the local Mall to show us how to get to the trip we were booked on! Wow. Only negative was the Morton’s Restaurant, unless you are into a dark gloomy ambience with head banging music and abrupt staff then I suggest you give it a miss! Obviously a franchise as it was not conducive with the Mandarin Oriental service and quality.",5,October 2019,

As we are newly wed, there were many uncertainties during the initial stage of the planning. She was very patient and swift in replying all our questions via text messages.   To Jason, operation manager of our actual day. We were very excited on that day and we were clueless on what we will be expecting. He sat down with us & told us the time flow for the dinner. Even right before the 1st & 2nd March in, he patiently told us what to do again despite us being anxious.   To Jessica, our personal butler.

Excellent stay as always,Norfolk_Lass,"This was my 9th stay in the hotel. I had a club Marina Bay room on floor 20 which has amazing views particularly at night. I had an arrival transfer from the airport included in the package which went very smoothly and I was met on arrival at the hotel and checked in in my room.My room had everything I needed (a nespresso machine was a new addition) and it was kept spotlessly clean throughout my stay.  Having a club room meant I could go to the club lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and hors d'oeuvres (and anytime in between). The food and drink in the lounge is a very high quality. Andrew and his team in the club lounge do a fantastic job of looking after the guests. They are very accommodating, incredibly warm and friendly and will resolve any issues you may have.

The service is impeccable( note to the room cleaners, you guys are like magical fairies with what you did to our rooms!), everyone is extremely friendly and willing to help with a smile.  The highlight, apart from the buffet (which was great) the pool guys were outstanding. Special shout out to SID at the pool. He was very attentive to the kids and made us feel like we were welcome and that the kids weren’t a bother. He went out of his way to make us feel special.  The location is great, the food is great.

Absolutely superb,Richard K,"Loved this hotel. All the little touches made this hotel one of the best I’ve stayed at. The turn down service in the evening, the superb staff at poolside who treated her like a queen. The room they offered for me to take a shower before I left for the airport late at night. The breakfast was most definitely the best breakfast in any hotel I’ve ever stayed at and I would hazard a guess that you would struggle to find any hotel in the world that offers a better breakfast spread than the mandarin oriental Singapore.  I will be coming back in March and although there are so many luxury hotels Singapore as to offer,I’ve already booked this hotel on free cancellation due to the superb experience I had last time.

Fantastic Hotel,maddyk77,"I have just returned from 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental. The rooms were clean, service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I upgraded to a Club room overlooking Marina Bay. The views were amazing and access to the Oriental Club was definitely worth the upgrade. From arrival at the airport my friend and I were greeted by the hotel’s Mercedes Benz transfer, a welcoming and friendly gentleman. Arrival at the hotel was even more impressive and we were greeted at the hotel’s entrance by name, a very warm and personal touch. Check in via Club Lounge was both relaxing and trouble free.

From the start of the wedding preparations till the very end, the MO team went to great lengths to ensure that every single little detail was taken care of with meticulous precision and most importantly, with H-E-A-R-T. I cannot stress that last bit enough, service with heart is of utmost importance especially during the final crunch -- the last 4 weeks that led up to the wedding day -- when things started to get crazy, our coordinators Elena and Elaine calmly (and rationally) handled whatever last-minute changes and requests we were throwing at their…",5,October 2019,

Amazing staff but very dated hotel.,rrlondon500,"First things first. The staff are AMAZING at this hotel. They are friendly, polite and will do everything to make you comfortable. But the building and facilities bring it down.   I stayed here for three nights on club floor 19. Arriving at the hotel is quite chaotic. There is basically not a lobby so it’s always chaos. It looks to me like they got rid of the lobby to have more wedding space. Regardless i was whisked to 19 floor to check in via lounge.   My room was nice just a bit dated especially the bathroom.   My biggest gripe with the hotel are. the public areas. They are dark, depressing and so unwelcoming. Think no windows and 1982 style.

Fabulous Service,kelwez,"We stayed for 5 nights from 11th June, we booked a ocean view room but asked for a balcony room on arrival.  Booking direct meant we were able to add on a benefit of choice, we added breakfast for us both.  We were allocated room 1123 on the 11th floor.  The room was nice, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large but found the shower cubicle on the small side.  I did find the hairdryer slightly hard to use as you had to hold in the power button, this could be an issue for some.  We were given a room with a balcony, but it had no furniture, the balconies here are not used in the traditional sense.  We did ask for some chairs, which they brought up without question, but the feel was not quite what we expected, they could really make better use of this extra space.  There is…",5,June 2019,

Nice and helpful staff but booking system needs improvement,Robin F,"Overall the stay for us was quite nice (stayed from Sept 26 to 29). There is a Fans of M.O. program where if you sign up to be a member, you can get two additional benefits, where one of them is a room upgrade or complimentary breakfast, or spa credit etc. This would've been great if it really were an upgrade for us.   Because we are a married couple and traveling with a small child, I distinctively remember booking (via their official website) for a room with king-sized bed and a view that overlooks the bay with Marina Sands Bay in sight. I was debating between Marina Bay Sands and Mandarin Oriental, but ultimately decided to go with the latter but wanted to have a view of the Marina Bay Sands.

The concierge team recently started offering a Wednesday morning “Discover Singapore’s Morning Market and Local Breakfast Tour.”  This is an exclusive tour offered to the guests of the hotel.

Amazing,Steve_jersey_86,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a terrific time. We had a corner Ocean/Marina Bay view Club room on the 21st (top) floor. It had its own balcony with a great view of the bay, Ferris wheel, MB Sands etc. The hotel was one of the best we have stayed in with the staff so helpful and friendly. We in particular enjoyed the Oriental Club which our room granted us access to; the breakfast and afternoon tea in there were really good and the pre dinner champagne and cocktails a great way to kick off the evening. The pool area was also a great way to cool off after a day of exploring. Would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to staying again in the not too distant future. ",5,September 2019,
Needs Improvements,Izhar CJ,"Arrived 1600 Hours and the room is not ready. Me and my siblings the 3 of us inside the room with all amenities sets for 2pax. I thought they have ample time regarding it but Housekeeping manage to come by at 1730 Hours to solve the issue. Found previous guest items (chocolates) inside the drawer. The kettle jug has water inside, when calling the Operator, she state it is normal practice of them to put water inside. I find that hard to believe as for hygienic issues. Breakfast was great. Frontman Concierge and Receptionist are humble and welcoming. Aside to that, I hope MO improves more. Nothing to complaint but maybe I have high expectations for a high rated Hotel as for the value.",3,September 2019,

50th Birthday Treat,VikkiBPerth,"I’ve never had a bad experience here which is why I keep coming back and my 50th was no exception. From the personalised photo taken in my room when we arrived to the complimentary birthday cake it was a fantastic week. The club lounge is one of the best I’ve ever visited and again the staff were outstanding making me feel super special every day. Yes the hotel is getting a little tired and some areas need attention but that’s just cosmetic, it’s hard to beat that service. Thanks to Jess and the team.",5,July 2019,

Excellent service and beautiful view,John L,"We stayed here for 3 nights to attend a wedding. Upon arrival and checking in, we were greeted with welcome drink, refreshing ginger drink and wet towel for freshening up after a long flight. What a great service and first impression. We were fortunate enough to have a room with direct amazing view to the Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer. The night view was superb. The house keeping was fantastic, besides the daily house keeping, every evening our room was made ready for the night, lights dimmed and etc. The buffet breakfast was fantastic, with wide spread of Asian, Chinese, Malay, Indian, and western food.   Truly one of the best hotel and holiday experiences we had so far.",5,September 2019,
Quiet confidence trumps pretension,Eli B,"Sometimes one tires of hotels whose credibility is an Instagram of a champagne bucket or a bathroom so swish it omits a towel rack or a hook on the door. But my pet peeve is that I don’t need my shower gel to be made from flowers handpicked in the Andes by happy ethnic tribespeople. That’s why i love the Mandarin O, because it doesn’t live in the era of spin and unabashed self-promotion.     The hotel’s retro appeal has more to do with character than appearance, comfort and impeccable service. The location is great. Marina Bay and downtown skyscrapers glitter beyond the windows and colonial architecture is beautifully illuminated in the foreground. Love the swimming pool terrace with its uncrowded separateness from other buildings, palm trees and cabanas resulting in resort-like…",5,August 2019,
I am a fan of Mandarin Oriental - not,Roadtrip_Fan_UK,"I used to be a fan of this hotel but years have gone by seemingly without any investment and it shows. The room looked tired and in need of a refurbishment. Light switches falling off, wardrobe doors not closing, uneven aircon, mediocre cleanliness - not what I expect from a 5 star establishment. Staff are superbly professional and courteous but I will avoid this MO until the property has undergone a refurb. For the prices charged by the MO, there are now several better options in town.

Faded glory with inconsistent service,Kaprifol,"Our stay was initially supposed to be our honeymoon which we mentioned in the booking. As we decided to postpone our wedding we sent an email to the hotel informing them that our stay would not be our honeymoon after all. The reply from the hotel was that they were happy we would be celebrating our honeymoon at MO Singapore. I wrote back saying we would NOT be celebrating our honeymoon - please read my initial email again. To add to the incompetence we received an email from guest relations a few days prior to our stay stating how delighted they were that we would be celebrating our honeymoon. Again I had to make clear that we would NOT be celebrating our honeymoon.

Hotel check in was a breeze. The check-in staff even showed us to our room while bellhop brought up our luggage.   We had breakfast 5 of the 7 mornings we we there. There was something for everyone. We had buffet dinner one one and It was magnificent. Aside from local dishes there was plenty of shrimp and lobster.  The buffet was pricey but definitely worth it. We ordered a drink, Singapore Sling, during dinner which was very overpriced. I would recommend not having alcoholic beverages at the hotel.",5,September 2019,

Exceptional service for a perfect birthday stay,Kristoff Clark,"Wow, wow, wow.  From the moment you get out of the cab - to the moment the same concierge runs through a checklist before you leave - the service at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore surpassed anywhere we’ve ever stayed.  We were coming back from a week in Thailand and my partner was treating me for my birthday for one night in Singapore before flying home to Sydney.  The Mandarin Oriental was the perfect choice!  We checked in around lunchtime and were swiftly escorted by the receptionist to our room, who explained features and showed us around.

Great hotel - fantastic view,Londontripadviser,"This is a very nice hotel.  My preference is for boutique hotels, which this is not, but it still delivered.  The room was clean and pleasant, the breakfast was great with a huge range of options and types of cuisine.  The pool was large, with plenty of places to lie around the pool (NB make sure you take goggles as the chlorinated water played havoc with my eyes).  The service was slick.

Over good views but tiered,LAEAI,"I was here for business and stayed the weekend. The hotel is in a good location has great views from its hotel  I almost upgraded my room to a marina bay view suite, however when I was in it, it was pokey and just tired and it would have another $200+ usd per night. Instead I was in the marina bay view delux room which is open and much better. All the rooms are tired and in need of modernizing and need a facelift  The staff are friendly to a point The Chinese Restaurent in the hotel is not great !  Thanks ",2,September 2019,

Magical Wedding Experience,Ashley Liew,"My wife and I are overjoyed that we picked Mandarin Oriental to be our wedding dinner banquet venue for 40 tables! It was an exciting year-long process that got really hectic especially in the last few weeks. Thankfully, Chamaine Aw (event management manager) and her team got us through with the meticulous attention to details and their professionalism. We are especially appreciative that she was so patient and accommodating regarding our unusual requests for a non-traditional dinner, which eventually turned out to be almost like a musical!

China Town, Little India and Arab Street are not also within walking distance or a short MRT ride away.

Disappointing,Giveitagonow7,"You know how you set yourself to expect a certain standard of a certain chain? With respect to its service to the room and food and so on? I expected the MO Sing to be plush, with excellent service and with rooms that impress.   Many parts of this property are faded. The service was hit and miss. And the rooms are small and underwhelming. I had a marina bay view room so the view was stunning.   I like to chose hotels that imbibe local culture esp in their rooms. The room here (other than the view) could have been an expensive motel room on a US highway. The room was just soulless I thought. The bathroom ancient. With a spot of grout in it for added effect.

Now the building and location are the same but the service and all the little touches that made it such a fine top class hotel are gone. it simply is not up to the standards one expects of a Mandarin Oriental and, frankly, feels like it is going to close or change brands soon.  This all leaves me in two minds how to review. The hotel feels completely different, the supercars once parked outside replaced by tourist buses embarking package tourists. All of whom are doubtless delighted by the rooms and the pool which remain excellent, although the rooms are increasingly tired.  The once excellent services round the pool are long since gone and if there is a poolside menu still it is a closely…",3,August 2019,
Best Singapore Experience with Mandarin Oriental,Vera K,"Amazing property just in the heart of the city. Attentive service, friendly people and very tasty food.  Very good breakfast and very cozy bar next to the pool with iconic view. Thank you the very best Mandarin for unforgettable moments in Singapore. ",5,August 2019,
If i could give more then 5 stars I would,Nils H,"Wow... what an absolutely excellent hotell with the best service I have ever had, Mandarin Oriental is not the biggest hotel on the block but I am sure there is no better service anywhere in Singapore. We had three fantastic days in Singapore where the Hotel service gave us the edge. We stayed at the club floor where the allways open clubroom was superb. The breakfurst, afternoon tea and evening hors-deuvre was top class and served by the most excellent and friendly staff, We missed them already in teh car back to the airport. If I come back to Singapore this is my choice of living",5,June 2019,
Highly Recommended,paullim2016,"Location wise, it is close to shopping malls (Suntec City) and the train station (MRT). So it is easy to get around.   Service- staff is really well trained. Ask for I for information and they will provide. I cut my finger and asked for plasters and they gave me more than what I had expected!!  Room size is very very comfortable. Bathtub looks out to the Seaview! Very nice experience. Would be good if they can provide bath salt for the bath that looks out to the scenery.   They have nice restaurants and food is good. Love the ambience at the bar but drinks are slightly more expensive than what you get elsewhere. But what do you expect from a good hotel like this.   Not cheap to stay here but I wouldn’t mind paying for what I experienced.   ",5,August 2019,
A week+ in Singapore—home away from home.,alexarcross,"Very centrally located hotel. Close to a lot of amenities including the harbor, shopping malls and attractions. Not far from subway stations. My daughter was here on business and I tagged along. I toured while she worked and then we did Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Harbor Light Show and more in the evenings. Morton’s in the hotel was fabulous for martini and appetizer dinners. The pool was up high, lovely with a view toward the harbor. ",5,January 2019,
Fantastic hotel,M&N,Just stayed at the MO for three nights. An excellent hotel with views of the bay and marina bay sands.

Room 1 couple + 2 children  Terrible booking service!,Rui B,"This hotel accepted a reservation for a couple and 2 children in 1 room! There was only one bed! They knew the kids ages!  Payed an extra for a suite and payed for 1 bed, one extra bed and my son had to sleep on the sofá that wasn’t really a bed! That’s not acceptable for a 5 star hotel! Really do not recommend, there are much better and much cheaper hotels in the area! In one word- never again! This hotel should be ashamed of charging me extra for nothing,really! Totally disappointed,",1,July 2019,
Impeccable service,terrencecT9851TT,"We arrived at 4 am long before check in time but the concierge let us store our luggage at the hotel until a room was available. They even offered to let us have breakfast and use the pool while waiting, and recommended a few spots in the vicinity where we could explore, all while being really attentive and helpful. Check in time is in the afternoon but our room was sorted by 10am. The room was clean, spacious and cozy. There were complimentary chocolates and seasonal fruit as well. We were taken very good care of and it was a very enjoyable stay here. ",5,August 2019,
"A very enjoyable stay, made all the more memorable with on the whole great service from passionate staff.",nick164,"With my usual hotel choice in Singapore (Raffles) still unopened, it took a while to make a decision amongst the various premium hotels in Singapore. Two things stood out when booking the MO - a large number of reviews complemented the excellent service and also their excellent pool. I was not disappointed.  Check-in was smooth and efficient. Arriving before the allocated check-in time, I was happy to find only after a short wait my room was made available. Kindly upgraded from a Club King to a Club King Bay View, it was a reasonable size and very well maintained.   From arrival to departure, with just a couple exceptions, all staff show geniune warmth and a passion to provide excellent service.

Excellent Hotel,Hsiuchen1972,The living ecperience in Mandrian Oriental Singapore is wonderful.

Exceeding Expectations,Chef_Philip,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental as my birthday gift for my mother. We stayed 3 nights and we loved everything. The location is prime. Close to every tourist attraction and activity you can think of. I'd say it is more on the higher end scale, but definitely worth every dollar. The room we stayed in is very clean and the view specially at night is amazing. Breakfast was also top notch, with sections and sections of choices. The staffs were remarkable, they truly look fter their guests. My mom was surprised with cake waiting for her in our room  after breakfast, and another cake when we had dinner at their Italian restaurant the Dolce Vita. On our last day, we lounged by the pool with breathtaking views of the marina. I will definitely be stayingagain  in anyof the Mandarin…",5,April 2019,

Great location and Service,Matt B,"We had two short stays at the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore and loved both of them. We stayed in a club room which was large and had a great view over the Marina. The executive club itself is very relaxing and being able to stop in there anytime from breakfast to late means you don't just have to sit in your room. The staff in the club were fantastic and in particular the fact they went out of their way to help celebrate my birthday was much appreciated. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,July 2019,

"Great service, wonderful views, excellent spa ",LThomas1301,"Stayed 3 nights here and enjoyed our stay. Service is high. Amenities at hotel are excellent. Cherry Garden restaurant and hotel spa are excellent. Concierge helpful with providing hotel car and tour guide. Arranged an enjoyable 3-hr tour for us and another couple. Gym is very modern with techno gym equipment. Lovely pool and amenities. Views of the harbor are beautiful. Stayed on 16th floor and also had little balcony. Only downside was the limited drawer space. Big closet, but for 2 people not enough shelving or drawers. Pretty expensive but the views and service were with it. MO Bar is also nice and chic. Great drinks and unique desserts. ",5,August 2019,
Overall a good stay but ....,jeffreym2017,"Stayed again at the Mandarin on a business trip.  This time had a room on the 9th floor, seemed to be in need of renovation as it looked dated and different from rooms I have stayed in previously.  The breakfast buffet was fine, it was not crowded as it was early so the staff was really overly attentive but that’s fine.  Other than the room was a very good stay.",3,August 2019,
Perfect place for a Singapore holiday,Docmom16,We spent 4 nights 5 days at this wonderful hotel and were impressed with the excellent service starting with Nikki at check in who made sure our children were moved from a twin bed room ( for US tourists please note the twin beds are very small and can only accommodate 1 child each) to a larger room with a rollaway bed for our three children. We had several meals at Melt cafe where the buffet breakfasts were the best we have ever had with a huge selection of food and excellent service with Ganesan making sure our cappuccinos were ready for us the minute we sat down! The buffet dinner at Melt was also delicious with an unsurpassed range of desserts and a huge thank you to the manager Alex Wong for catering to our every need and taking such good care of our children.

In need of an upgrade,cliveWa,"Like the Pan Pacific nearby, this hotel is in a good location, but is in significant need of an upgrade throughout all areas. Some rooms are better than others (though it looks very 1980’s). It isn’t anywhere near the quality or style of the MO in Bangkok or Hong Kong.  The staff were very good, but a little light on resources at reception which means you can wait quite a long time to check in and out. The breakfast offering also needs a lot of work as the qualty is very average. The Indian station was probably the best.  The pool area is nice and the restaurant near the pool is a pleasant place to sit for a drink. The rooms are large and given Singapore is now a very expensive destination, good value for money, particularly given the location is so close to the Quays and the…",3,July 2019,

Mandarin Oriental Singapore,Richard G,"Visited this hotel for 4 days earlier in July.  The views are great you can see MBS which looks fantastic. The hotel staff were perfect, always attentive and very detail orientated which was lovely.   Being a MO all the food was exceptional, especially breakfast.

perfect city views,FoSa,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental during a trade show event. The hotel was in close proximity to the Marina Bay Sands and I used to walk over the little bridge, which did not even take 10 minutes. The rooms are spacious and offer everything you would expect when staying at a Mandarin Oriental.  Breakfast buffet is lavish and the lovely hostess remembered my name everyday, besides having more than hundreds of travelers walking in and out each day. I enjoyed my breakfast on the terrace for 2 days, but was disturbed by the crows, which came and stole fruits from my plate even while I was eating. The Steakhouse offered a lovely dinner and the service was attentive and prompt.

Delightful Wedding Lunch Banquet,Yiann Q,"My husband and I held our wedding lunch banquet at MO this past Jan 2019 in their cosy 17-table banquet hall.  It has been 6 months since the event but we have only good things to say about the staff and overall experience.  We were very well taken care of by the whole team and where possible, the team led by Manager Ms Charmaine Aw, banquet manager Yi Qin and butler Alice always went above and beyond.  For example, we were not having our church wedding before the wedding lunch (we had been married in church a few months prior) and Charmaine kindly extended the option of staying the night before to allow us some extra time to settle in and prepare for the lunch.

So we went for a late lunch while waiting for the call as we understand that we were early for the check in and the official check in time is 3pm. We waited until 3.30pm and decided to call the hotel for status. And we were told that the room will be ready in 10 to 15mins time and they will give us a call again once it is ready.

Had in room dining. Satay was abit sad. The Hokkien Mee & Smoked salmon waffles were good. Enjoyed the fireworks from the comfort of our room.  Chose celebratory cake as one of the MO fan benefits but never came. We all miss things so that’s ok.  Main issue was being unpleasantly woken up by loud drilling above us. Wanted to extend our stay but not anymore after that. I understand renovation needs to be done, just at least inform us in advance.  Will I come back?

It was very large, king bed and rollaway bed. The extra 1/2 bath was helpful with 4, and we appreciated being able to have both us and the kids in one suite. View was lovely, service was impeccable. Breakfast buffet was included if you join their membership club (free), and the buffet was out of this world. Definitely do it. Definitely felt like the hotel was more geared to business travelers or in-town business meetings but we did not feel out of place as family tourists. Swimming pool was lovely as was the pool service and we loved the first-come, first-serve cabanas. The MRT (subway) is a 5-7 minute indoor walk through the adjacent Marina mall.

From the very moment we walked in and checked in, every single employee was exceptional attentive and thoughtful. It gave us the perfect start to our wonderful honeymoon. Nothing was ever too much, not that we asked a great deal, but it was the little details that really made it special. We had access to the Club Lounge and the team in there were absolutely brilliant. Customer service was taken to an entirely new level. Have to call out Matt (not sure of his full name) but he really helped make our trip even more special with his helpful tips on Singapore and also gave us some advice on the Maldives as he had been to where we were going.

After looking over the room I had to go back to the front desk and see if they could help, after a few minutes they were able to find something on the 20th floor with much better views and a nicer room, this was great.

The service levels at this property are excellent and their team are exemplary. Special mention to Sujee, Vanessa, Nancy and Ganesan at the Melt who assisted us with our breakfasts every morning. Very personable without being too over bearing.   I was a little concerned initially when making the booking about the comments on the tired look, but did not see that at all during the stay.

Fabulous views of Marina Bay,Lisa L,"This is the second time we have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Singapore. We had a Marina Bay View room which is one of the reasons I would always choose the Mandarin Oriental for stays in Singapore. The view of the Marina Bay Sands, the art Science Museum, Gardens By The Bay and the city skyline is superb. The location was great - just a short walk from the MRT, and it is easy to walk to the Marina and Gardens by The Bay, and across the road is a small food centre if you get back late and fancy some roti at a reasonable price!

It’s within walking distance of the Bay area, Chinatown, Clarke Quay and Raffles with the MRT close by too.  We stayed in an Ocean View room that had a view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and Singapore Flyer. It really was a breathtaking view, especially at night time when everything was lit up.  The room was spotlessly clean and very comfortable, although a little dated. The bathroom had a separate shower and bath. The toiletries weren’t great for a 5 star hotel so I’m glad I took my own.

Beautiful Property,Maureen D,I recently stayed here for a business conference and had a wonderful experience. The view from my hotel room were just lovely and I couldn't get enough of the hotel buffet at Melt (which is good because our program had us eating there twice a day).

Great Hotel!,Charalambosh,Stayed for eight days with my wife and son. Had an amazing time in the property. All staff are great. One of the best teams I’ve seen so keep it up guys. The Chinese restaurant was excellent. The steak house equally good but extremely expensive. The swimming pool was absolutely fantastic with the view of the skyline. Generally the property is well kept and is a pleasure to be part off. Couple points that I would like to suggest for improvement is the rooms that can be freshened up slightly to be in line with other Mandarins and also the lack of generosity with the toiletries. I think that long stayers and families which we were both cannot have showers on one bottle of shampoo/shower-gel etc and then have to ask for replacements the following day as the half empty bottles were…,5,July 2019,

Everyone else I met along the way had such pleasant smiles and friendly greetings, made me feel so at home!  One person to highlight was this gentleman, Matt. He happened to bump into me and escorted me to the counter. Following which, he also escorted me to my room, chatting all the way. I told him it was my first time in Singapore and asked for some recommendations for sightseeing. He told me all he could during the short trip up to my room. So I thought that was it.  However, he went above and beyond the usual standard of service. He knocked on my door about an hour after, with a handwritten…",5,June 2019,
Memorable experience,Nicole,"Mandarin Oriental has been my go-to hotel for all my travels across the world. This time, I've had the pleasure of being served by Matt, who has provided me with excellent customer service and is the epitome of service in this line. His dedication, passion and willingness to go the extra mile for all the guests despite of their different backgrounds. I was surprised at his attention to detail, even to the slightest and smallest things. Witnessing his tactfulness with a difficult guest that he took over from his colleague who are not exactly easy to deal with and with great patience the other unreasonable guest became a good friend of him and the club.  Even though it was not too long a stay at mandarin oriental this time, it was my pleasure to have cross paths with him.…",5,June 2019,

Decided to stay in for the evening and we had front row seats to the fireworks from NDP rehearsal at 8pm, while chomping on a choc cake sent up by, you guessed it, the lovely Charissa.

Singapore, being a fast paced city, it offered us sanctuary within this thriving metropolis. Shopping right in the hotel complex is very handy indeed. It was spoiled by one retailer ‘Salvatore Dali beauty treatments’ offering mum a free eye treatment. One eye was treated and we could see a difference. I asked them to do the other eye for her and they said ‘don’t you want to know the price?’ We said yes, but can you do the other eye? She said it’s 1007. We said $10.70? No. $100.70?

This time, our stay here at the MO S’Pore followed Grand Hyatt HKG and Six Senses Yao Noi. That may be part of the let down...  Of course, the location and property are exceptional. However, the service is inconsistent. There are some exceptional and familiar faces, but there are some inattentive or cold aspects to some of the staff. The worst experience has been breakfast.

Furthermore, it surprised us that in a five star hotel in 2019 you actually don't have a free internet connection. Overall, the hotel is not impressive at all. Would not return again.",3,May 2019,
Wonderful contemporary experience in Singapore,gogo1951,Started a trip to SE Asia with a few days in Singapore. The feel of the city is reflected in this hotel. Large and efficient and ultimately set apart by the service and desire to accommodate. Our family was put in one of the signature 2 bedroom suites and after a 17 hour flight from Los Angeles the elegance and comfort restored us quickly.   The hotel should be proud of its staff top to bottom. This is a pretty big hotel and handles large groups but they do it comfortably and delivered a personalized 5 star experience.   The team at the Concierge desk seemed to be constantly changing but each individual was exceptionally competent and gracious.   You should not hesitate to book here for comfort and branded MO luxury.,5,May 2019,
Birthday celebration,Rihsab,"We chose your hotel to celebrate my birthday. Charissa Jerome Lin your Guest Relations Executive could not have done enough to make us welcome. The room was laid out very well for birthday celebration, with balloons, birthday card, and that wonderful chocolate cake. Many thanks Charissa for your warm welcome",5,June 2019,
Fantastic choice for Marina Bay area,Pittsy21,"My wife, 7 month old, and I stayed for 5 nights in a suite with a Marina Bay view. We had a great time and would thoroughly recommend the Mandarin Oriental to anyone visiting Singapore. The best part of the hotel was the service which went the extra mile. For example we sent some babies bibs to the laundry and their cleaning partner ruined them by washing them at too high temperature, however the housekeeping team went and purchased the exact same bibs and gave them to us to replace the ruined ones and never charged us for the laundry.   Pros - Great location. Next to Marina Square and Suntec Malls, walkable to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens By the Bay, and near two MRT stations - Promenade and Esplanade - Excellent breakfast - Fantastic service as described above  - Very nice…",5,June 2019,
Needs upgrading.  Bad value for money. Past it's heyday.,datraveller1,Stayed in a club room- big mistake and waste of money!  The food in the club lounge was really terrible- especially all the cooked food was surprisingly bad- and the decor and vibe uninspiring.  Archaic and annoying rule that ladies must have knees covered in club lounge.  Room was very in need of upgrade.  Carpet felt like it hadn't been steam cleaned in many years.  Housekeeping not very clean.  Pool area nice. Most common areas nice.  Good location.,3,May 2019,
Wedding Celebration,Chris Khoo,"We held our wedding at Mandarin Oriental, and it was the best venue we could ask for.  The hospitality shown from the start to end was second to none. Over the 3 days of stay, each and every one of our requests are carefully responded to. Lynette, our experience manager, was someone so responsible and effective that you can leave the trickiest part of the event to her, and she will never disappoint. Breakfast at Melt was something we looked forward to every morning, no question as to why it’s regarded as one of the best buffet in Singapore.  There is nothing Mandarin Oriental can’t do for you, you have to experience it on your own to find out, strongly recommend!",5,June 2019,
Absolutely wonderful!,bettymJ3303JE,"Beautiful room, great view of light show at night; Santosh, the Indian head chef, was amazing—made special dishes for my food allergies—incredible place, close to mall & food. Staff was friendly and helpful",5,April 2019,
Good but not great,Duncan G,"We stayed 2 nights in a Marina Bay Club room - excellent room & views as you would expect.  The club lounge was good, although quite 'formal' compared to other lounges in Singapore.  We came away feeling a little underwhelmed however.  Paying almost £450 per night we felt it should have been better - service in the bar adjacent to the pool  was not good, incorrect drinks delivered & long delay in getting replacement.  The bill upon check out was also incorrect - We probably will spend our $ elsewhere when we return.",4,May 2019,
Execellent view of Marina Bay area,kikokicks,"Went for a staycation here for the weekend. Front staff are amazingly warm and welcoming. Patient with the checkin process. Offered me the MO membership and benefits. Explained to me where to have my welcome drinks. Room is great with fantastic view of Marina Bay Area. Room temperature is just right. Bed lulls you to sleep well. I wish there were more cable channels to choose from! But anyway, reading a good book while seated by the window is more than enough too! The bar by the pool can feel a bit stuffy (went there late afternoon). Two white guys attending there seem to entertain the Caucasian giuests faster and more enthusiastically haha. Try the Paris MO cocktail! And by the evening, I relaxed by the pool (most white guys would’ve left because there was no more sun haha).…",5,June 2019,
Best hotel in the world,Kane,"Have travelled all across the world and this hotel is by far my favourite. Book a Marina Bay View Room for the best views of Singapore, and if you can afford it, stay in a Club Room. If you cant afford it, consider working some overtime or cutting your trip short (staying just a couple of nights at the Club to recieve the full service of Champagne breakfast, High Tea, and Evening Cocktails is more worth it than staying a week at any other average hotel). Always taken good care of by the Club staff, namely Rio, Matt, and Jaya, and the service is why we come back.",5,June 2019,
Great Location,NorthernTraveller68,"We stayed here for 3 nights only on a stopover to Bali.  The hotel is really well situated near the Marina Bay Sands / Gardens by the Bay so great for photo opportunities.  The room was fairly basic but did the trick for us on our short stay.  What did impress us was the staff in the dining room, who remembered your name when there were 100s of guests.  Breakfast was a real extravaganza with everything you could possibly think of, including ice cream !!!  Amazing  We had a hectic few days sightseeing and loved Singapore it is very easy to get around and we walked 20 Km round it 2 days on the trot, there's a lot to see.  Great hotel and great place.  Hope to go back one day.",5,September 2018,
Fabulous Hotel in Singapore,Wander Les,"I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 10 days - half for business and half a holiday with my husband. Really enjoyed our time and would absolutely stay here again. A few highlights: -The staff: Every person working in this hotel went out of their way to be accommodating and made us feel welcome, from the check in staff to the bartenders to the gentlemen working by the pool.  -The rooms: The bed is SO comfortable! I travel a LOT for work, and this was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever stayed in. They also have fantastic blackout shades which allowed us to sleep off the jet lag a bit :) -The location: This is walking distance from the Marina, which was our favorite part of the city.

Then they prepared not one, not two but three mini birthday cakes for my Wife during the whole stay! A 90-min massage treat for my Wife was also no less than amazing, by masseur Melanie.

From the moment of arrival I was whisked to my room by an attendant, I'd booked a club room overlooking Marina Bay, and it was amazing. The club room provides access to the club lounge, where the staff are worth their weight in gold and the drinks and food supplied are amazing. Used the pool twice, mainly as darkness fell and the pool is great, with some awesome views. My only gripe, the shower had a champagne settings, but no champage came out :) Made up for it in the club lounge every morning at breakfast, which again is included in the club room.

Visited their club lounge multiple times a day for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés and drinks. Can’t fault the amazing staff, particularly in the lounge - their service is well beyond what I had expected (and I’ve stayed at some beautiful, high-end places over the years). I don’t have a bad thing to say, the property is stunning, the pool has incredible views, the rooms are so well appointed, and it was serviced multiple times daily with refreshed tea bags and milk and water for me.

Cleanliness and attention to detail were superb in the rooms, the bar, the restaurant, reception and the beautiful pool.  We enjoyed a special family holiday there joined by our daughters from opposite sides of the world. Singapore is undoubtedly expensive but our experience was well worth it.

Upon reaching the driveway, we were warmly greeted by the friendly team with a huge bouquet of sunflowers (my favourite flower!) for me. I was extremely surprised and happy! What an awesome welcome experience. We were then brought to our room by Jessica and Ganesan for in-room check in.  When we entered the room, it was another surprise!

Got upgraded to a Marina view on top floor where my kid can see the MBS compound very nicely.   Rooms are clean and perfect. Not sure why other guests complained about age and tear.  My parents room got further upgraded to a Suite.  Room quality is better and newer than Conrad Senetor Suite nearby (2801) I would recommend especially if you have FHR access.

Amazing hotel,anna l,In my opinion Mandarin Oriental Singapore has the best location in Singapore - the view of Marina Bay and ability to walk to Marina Bay Sands Shoppers and Fullerton Bay Hotel area within a 10 minutes each place is very valuable. Also Mandarin  Oriental has one of the beautiful swimming pool's area I've ever seen. Just one downside that we were not able to fully enjoy the swimming pool due to the huge number of little babies with their parents and their inflatable gadgets inside the pool.

It is worth paying extra for a Marina Bay Club room as the view was superb with a large picture window looking over Singapore. We were there for 4 days and were wowed by the view from the room each time we entered it.  Having the Oriental Club lounge was also good as it meant a calm breakfast, good afternoon tea and evening canapés with drinks available all day. Well situated for getting around Singapore.

Great views of Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer and Supertree Grove - however, the room was distinctly old, tired and in major need of renovation. The bed was comfortable, is about the best that I can say about the room. The bathroom was tiny - single sink, tiny shower, low end shower gel/shampoo/conditioner etc. Towels were in meagre supply and we had to call housekeeping for more. I believe the club rooms get much nicer bath soaps etc. We enquired about upgrading to a club room however at an extra $500 per night this was not practical or appreciated.

We came back for more!,Edd,"Stayed three nights at the MO Singapore in April 2019. We had stayed there three years ago, liked it and chose it again. Its left a greater impression on my wife and I this time around.   All hotels at this level are clean, have nice rooms, have great facilities and so on. I think it was the little touches from all the staff we encountered that made the difference between good and great. Just one small example that we really liked was a little velcro cable-tidy put onto our iPhone chargers by the cleaner! Never had that before. Also, Lisa in the MO Bar served us a few times and treated us like royalty. Thank you.  A true test is whether you'll stay in the same hotel again. When we're next in Singapore we absolutely will.",5,April 2019,
"Looks the Part, but Unsatisfactory Service for a 5 Star",tthieu,"We were very disappointed with our experience at the Mandarin. From the moment we arrived, the entrance/door attendants and porters was not welcoming or helpful with our luggage.  At check-in we were informed that because of our American Express Platinum status we had access to amenities including complementary wifi and meal credit but no additional information beyond that. Upon arriving to our room and attempting to connect to the internet, we found a screen showing rates for internet access. Calling down to the front desk, we were told to just select any of the options but we would not be billed. We had to clarify with the manager to have the charge removed at check-out. The lack of consistency with the information provided and the honoring of our amenities was frustrating.…",2,April 2019,
Superb,Angelo C,I have never provided a review in the past. However in this case the level of service provided by the staff at Mandarin Oriental was superb and has motivated me to post this review. My appreciation to all the staff for their dedication,5,April 2019,
The worlds best,Calum Middleton,We Have Stayed in many MOs and the best were always Hong Kong & Bangkok! But now add Singapore to the list. Just outstanding and the best pool in the world. The stuff made my wife’s birthday so very special. Can’t wait for next visit,5,February 2019,
The staff at this hotel make you feel like royalty!!,abbyashford,"Wow, wow and wow!! This hotel really knows what it is doing, I cannot fault the staff at all. I visited Singapore early February of this year for a total of 5 nights, 3 of these nights were spent in the Marina Bay Sands, which is opposite The Mandarin Oriental and it is a very, very beautiful grand hotel, famous in Singapore and around the world. But, this hotel blew me away, it just proves that size doesn't always matter!! It was nice to actually have two hotels to compare it too, and to make me realise just how special the Mandarin actually is. The staff were just so personal, upon arrive we were greeted with wet towels and a shot of a lemon drink, which was so lovely and just automatically makes you feel so special! Rooms were immaculate and had everything you needed in there…",5,February 2019,

Disappointing Start but Some Kind People Made It Better,Roz R,"Booked a weekend staycation from 27-28 Apr with my sister. Decided to book the Club City View room so that we have access to the Club Lounge. My sis & I also came with high hopes .. heard so much about MO & we’ve been around to the other hotels around the area & we’ve had the opportunity to be in really fantastic rooms with spectacular views. However, we were given a room at the 14th floor with not much of a view. Honestly, it felt as if I had booked a normal room, totally did not justify the cost I had paid for it. And to think that I had paid for a club level room. Was also expecting more since I’m a Fan of MO too. Was so disappointed with it that I immediately spoke to a hotel staff at the check-in counter - her name was Liza & she assisted to upgrade us to the Club Marina…",3,April 2019,

"Mandarin Oriental, a nice hotel, but not the best location",Jeffrey E,"My wife and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, over the Easter holidays. We were there with our daughter and our grandchildren.  A nice hotel with very friendly staff, excellent facilities and very good dining. My only issue for us was not the best of locations. It was typically hot and humid as Singapore usually is, which made the walk to the MRT or to Gardens by the Bay quite stressful for the little ones.  On the positive, they loved the excellent swimming pool and we spend a lot of time there.   The rooms were large and well equipped with ample dining options, including a very good breakfast buffet.   For us the highlight was the lovely staff and their friendly banter, which was both amusing and endearing.  We had a great time.",4,April 2019,
Suppressed all my expectations!,Slackila Ali,"I brought my family for weekend Staycation at Mandarin Oriental, Singapore. We stayed in the Mandarin Room and was given an extra bed for my child. This room offers a private balcony overlooking Suntec city. At the evening, I was surprised with complimentary fruits and chocolates offered to us. The chocolates were obviously gone in 60 seconds and kids loved it. We used the swimming pool and the staffs there were extremely courteous and very accommodating. They had sunscreen and tanning lotions available for guest use. We had buffet breakfast @ Melt Cafe. On arrival, we were escorted by a member of the staff to the outdoor sitting as per our request. They offered an array of drink selection including juices, coffee, and tea served directly to us. Of all the hotel breakfast…",5,April 2019,
Great Stay,MarsTheWorldTraveler,"I was there for business during three nights and really enjoyed my stay. Buffet breakfast was fantastic - so many stations and very flavorful! Staff was very polite and efficient. Room was spacious and nice, with a classic decor that was just slightly outdated. Gym was nice, so was the pool but I didn’t try it due to the bad weather. Location was perfect for my meetings and there’s also a shopping mall just next door that was quite convenient. I also liked their MO Bar - quite lively and nice drinks. They have a Morton Steak restaurant and other options too, but I didn’t have time to try them. I’ll definitely return back.",5,April 2019,

A Lovely 2 Night Stay in Singapore!,MrsOL,"Our family of 4 (including 3 year old toddler and 10 month old infant) stayed at this hotel in April 2019 for 2 nights in a city suite.  The hotel is situated about 30 minutes from Changi Airport, and we had arranged transfers with the hotel which were comfortable although expensive.  We were met by the car by concierge, who organised our luggage to be taken to our room, whilst proceeding to show us directly to our suite. The hotel lobby was stunning and the staff were extremely welcoming. As mentioned, we were taken to our suite, which had views of the city (not the best views) although the room was extremely spacious.

Yes I can understand how some people think the rooms are dated but for us it just added to its charm. We had an amazing view of the marina bay sands hotel and everything around it from our room.

"A memorable stay at Mandarin Oriental, in the MO room ",Stef,"We stayed at the MO room in Mandarin Oriental Singapore, and it was a very memorable stay. The staff were very helpful - stowing away the numerous amounts of bags and wedding props that we had brought with us. They were attentive, and the service rendered was always efficient. The room itself- and the space was what made us feel like we were at home. The comfortable living room area- whereby our friends came to hang out. I quite liked the decorations in the room- especially the pretty gong in the bathroom. The intricate details - are what impressed me the most. Such as the special welcome amenity of tea served in a Chinese teapot. Overall, it was a fantastic stay. A very memorable one. We ll definitely be back! Kudos to the staff at Mandarin Oriental Singapore. ",5,March 2019,
Harbour view rooms are worth the extra cost,Lin0515,"We stayed here one night before leaving on a cruise of southeast Asia. Because we knew we'd be seriously jetlagged, we splurged on a harbour view room so we could see the Marina's lightshow from our room with a room service pizza. The hotel is very nice, clean, and in a great location--very close to the waterfront promenade, boat tour, and subway. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we've had anywhere--amazing array of Asian and Western dishes, with wonderful service.  This was our first stay in a Mandarin Oriental hotel. We expected facilities and service on par with other world class hotels such as Shangri La, Four Seasons, or Intercontinental. The hotel was fine but reminded us more of what we get in a Hilton or Marriott. If you're looking for a view, this is a perfect…",5,March 2019,

The staff were the perfect balance between amazingly helpful, whilst giving our own space. Breakfast was delicious, with such a wide choice of delicious, fresh food, as was Melt!

During the celebrations, the chef even came to the table to say hello. When we went to the hotel room, the room (which had been upgraded into a Deluxe Suite with Ocean View), was very clean. We were pleasantly surprised by the cake and chocolates they had left for the couple. There were also the customary two swans and roses on the bed. And, there was even a pencil with seeds in the cover for us to plant, and the pen for signing the bill was biodegradable. The view was marvellous, encompassing the Singapore Flyer, Singapore River, Pacific Ocean, Marina Bay Sands, and Gardens by the Bay. Overall, great! Will come back again. ",5,April 2019,

From food to drinks to just helping with our schedule- the best!  Location- You cannot beat the location or the views. The club floor is well worth it on so many levels so if you can add that- go for it.  F & B: Had a great drink and lunch at the MO bar (we were the only ones at the bar so it was a show in itself).

From the moment we stepped onto the property until the moment we left the service was impeccable.

The room was very comfortable and well equipped. It had the most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in and was kept beautifully clean (our thanks to the chamber staff). The swimming pool and surrounding area were great. Never had a problem getting sun-beds or even Cabanas. The hotel staff were all excellent - welcoming, helpful and patient. Everything you would want after a long journey and arriving at 2.00am. Special thanks to Ian Soh, Rooms Divison Manager. He was especially friendly and helpful.

The girl who helped us was extremely polite and took the time to ask us about our travels and was not overly intrusive which was a great welcome to the hotel and to Singapore.  She offered to show us to our rooms which I think is a nice gesture of service when hotel staff does this and is something I appreciate when staying at hotels.

Good and not so good,hunterwj,"We had a long tiring journey to get to the hotel, and when we arrived there were only two members of staff on check-in and quite a few people waiting. So we had a wait of about 15 minutes. When we got to our room we had to wait quite some time for our baggage, but we could then unpack. Before going for our evening meal we went to the toilet only to find it leaked all over the floor. We called maintenance and an engineer arrived quickly but said we would have to move rooms. So we repacked and moved to a different room, but turning on the washbasin tap we found it leaked, and so did the shower.

"More suitable for business, better options for leisure stays",jbm4075,"A little disappointed as I expected more from the MO brand. The lobby is dated, dark & depressing. Service from front desk and lobby staff was pretty 50-50, with about half enthusiastic & friendly, and the other half pretty nonchalant.  Rooms and washroom are spacious and clean, but again a bit dated and a little dusty.  Cross the street from the hotel entrance and you're right at Glutton's Bay and the Esplanade waterfront. You're also just a short walk to the Double Helix Bridge which connects to Marina Bay Sands. There's a direct mall connection to Marina Square but its a mall past its prime. Walk through Marina Square to get to better malls like Millennia Walk, Suntec City and Raffles Place.",4,April 2019,

Outstanding in every respect,robin p,"Our room on the 20th floor did not have a window. Instead the wall acing the port was one sheet of glass. Just spectacular. We watched a storm develop with lightning and sweep by - awe inspiring. There was every comfort in the large room and bathroom suite. Service was very friendly and efficient.  On our first night we went to the bar with our minds set on an expresso martini which we ordered without looking at the cocktail menu. The expresso martinis were excellent. On reading the cocktail menu we were struck by the story written around most of the cocktails listed, and many were unique to the hotel. On leaving we were offered a taster of one of their cocktails and we became instant fans. The architecture shows much imagination, minimilast comfort - the Japanese influence is…",5,March 2019,
Very Welcoming,Cory Newsome,Very happy with the stay. Was quite impressive. Exactly how I saw it on the internet. Rapid staff response despite time of the day. Will still stay next time if I'm around Singapore. Thanks for the hospitality.,5,January 2019,
Fantastic design!,teddiern,Very stunning architectural building. Room layout was great. Very clean with refreshing amenities room. Close to a lot of interesting activities and shopping. Staff very helpful and obliging. Definitely a first class hotel.,5,March 2019,
"Superb Hotel, Superb Service",Charlie1625,"The staff at this hotel could not be friendlier or more helpful.  The service at the reception desk, concierge, round the pool, and at breakfast were excellent.  The location is perfect as you can reach the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Mall/Restaurants by foot, as well as the Gardens By the Bay.  The rooms could do with a little updating, but they are quiet and comfortable. the swimming pool area is really lovely, with plenty of sun beds and a fabulous pool.  I would not hesitate to stay here again.",5,April 2019,
Very poor experience,77rahulb,"- old dated room - clogged wash basin - drilling noise in the middle of the night was terrible - one saving grace was that when I complained about the drilling noise, the couldn’t stop it but moved me to another room to sleep for a few hours",2,April 2019,

"Excellent food, perfect service",Andrew W,"My initial impression of the MO Singapore was a little disappointing. I arrived late and jumped in the shower, which was disappointingly weedy. I guess that isn't surprising when the water is imported / desalinated but still this was particularly disappointing having come from the MO in HK which I think has the best showers in the world.  However, things looked up from there. The pool area is lovely - not too busy, great views. The gym is good too. Breakfast was excellent - lots of choice, fresh juices.   Location was good - easy to the business area, shopping malls / Suntec etc behind. Overall a very pleasant stay. I would stay again.",5,April 2019,

The gym is great, the pool is fantastic, excellent hotel.",5,March 2019,
Good facility but not worth the premium,Sam P,"Spent 4 nights at the Ocean View room.  Facilities as expected was great! The pool is amazing and breakfast was decent.  However, for the premium price paid, the service level was lacking - ie. no turn down service.   Other 5 star hotels definitely provide that extra hospitality which makes it a 5 star hotel. ",4,March 2019,
Excellent buffet,DLWKent,"Seafood galore. Lobster , huge prawns with shell on. Cockles, mussels, etc.  Roast beef, curries, salads, deserts, freshly baked bread. I think it would be very easy to find something you would like to eat.   As far as I could tell you could go up as many times as you like. I certainly did.   My only criticism would be that the air con was a bit strong.   Plates were cleared away quickly.",5,April 2019,
AWESOME & AMAZING !!!,Daniel Adam,"We got complementary stay at Mandarin Oriental for 1 night stay. The room spacious, view Marina Bay Sand is perfect! Huge pool !!  Breakfast? Amazing!! They did very well on the service. Pretty large of selection of breakfast buffet, and this is the biggest buffet breakfast ever we had try among hotel that we have stayed. We had Nasi Lemak menu from the breakfast at the Hotel, and perfectly nice ever !! Me & partner was honoured to stayed at the 5 star hotel.  Thanks you for the marvellous service!",5,March 2019,
I didn’t want to go home!,Polarbearandwalrus,"I stayed here for a night. I was booked into a Club room and then upgraded to a Club Suite. I could have quite happily stayed here forever!   The Club Lounge is great. Free champagne and afternoon tea and other fresh snacks depending on the time of day.   We had breakfast in the main dining area as apparently it had better choice than the Club room. It was HUGE and very busy but had an amazing selection of breakfast food from all around the world. Service for fresh coffee orders was very slow and the waiting staff seemed overwhelmed. I had pancakes and then went back for bacon, eggs and hash browns.   The customer service here is excellent, the staff are very well trained. ",5,March 2019,
Showing its age,Aeroboffin,"We upgraded to a room on a higher floor with a better view of the bay. The carpet was slightly warn around the entrance to the room, the wallpaper was damaged in places, Generally in need of refurbishment. Breakfast was good with a great selection of food, but layout of food was spread over a wide area and slightly confusing. Excellent WiFi but not included in the cost without being a Fan. Next door to the Marina Mall (outdated). Sun-tech mall (more modern) few minutes walk through the Marina Mall without going outside (handy when torrential rain starts)!! All routes for the hop-on, hop-off bus are on the far side of the Sun-tech mall (10 minutes walk from hotel). Our stay was OK but not exceptional.",4,March 2019,
Beautiful pool and nice hotel,rakibey,"Nice property that is a bit dated, however very nice.  Staff are very helpful and made sure we had a great experience.

Great stay,Navigate28143486324,"Check in staff was extremely helpful, gave me one of the top floors with a great overlooking view of the marina Bay Area after knowing it was a anniversary surprise.

The Perfect Ending,Michelle J,"When you travel episodically there is a great deal of pressure to bring a long journey to a memorable conclusion and one that sustains the highest standards of success of the journey to date.  MO Singapore has been a final destination, a gateway to home, for several years now and once again they delivered in spades from the meeting at the terminal to check out, offering a seamless highly professional but personal service.   All those elements which make you feel an honoured guest where in place. Small needs were acceded to and there was real recognition throughout out that I am ""a Fan.""

So Relaxing,Joanne G,"This was our last night of our three week trip around Asia and sadly we only stayed here for one night. The hotel is in an excellent location within easy walking distance from the marina area attractions.....even in the heat of Singapore! The staff are very friendly and efficient even though it seems a very busy hotel. Our very spacious room overlooked the bay with great views. Large bedroom with large, well equipped bathroom. Lots of storage space. We dined at the Melt Cafe for the evening buffet. Although a little expensive, there is something for everyone. Great choices for every course. They also do alcoholic drinks specials ! Thank you to Alex for great service and conversation. The breakfast buffet is also very good although the service was a little less attentive. We…",5,March 2019,
Nice and efficient stay,Zac C,"I stayed in a smaller room but has a gorgeous view facing the Singapore Wheel and the pool.   The reception staff was nice and courteous and helped me book a quick lunch when I checked in. The staff at the cafe was polite but clearly overwhelmed by the sheer volume of guests. I had to wait for up to 5mins to get served to my table. It would be nice however to know in advance if breakfast is included or not at the point of being shown to the table. The egg station staff was probably the busiest and sulliest kitchen staff!  We also didn't get good service from the bellboy when asking for directions to the Marina Bay Sands. It was just a lazy wave of the hand and mumble. Wasnt great to say the least.   Last by not least, my bill was incorrect. A mysterious breakfast charge coupled…",3,March 2019,
Totally fabulous,suzyqshaw2018,"We stayed here overnight en route to Koh Samui as part of a holiday that we booked through Trailfinders. We were booked into another hotel which was being refurbished during our proposed stay so Trailfinders relocated us and paid the balance cost for changing from a 4* to this 5* hotel.  It was outstanding. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Marina view which we declined and we were very glad we didn’t as the view from our room was amazing. We had dinner in the International Buffet which was very varied and delicious. It was also very expensive but I can understand why. We had a morning swim in the lovely outdoor pool where we were handed lovely towels, iced water, newspapers and sunscreen.  Just great!",5,March 2019,
Great service,Sandy C,A lovely suite with an ample living room and separate bedroom.  It's quite nice to have two large room in a suite rather than having either two small rooms and calling it a suite or one much larger than the other.  There is desk space for those who need to work.  The hotel has the Cherry Garden for guests wishing to have dim sum plus many alternatives for those wishing to have a mix of foods.,5,January 2019,
Reserved and Elegance.,Glenn Dabatos,"Though the architecture and style of the Mandarin is now older (anything over 5 years in Singapore appears dated) but what it lacks in modern architecture it makes up for it inner beauty and serenity. The entrance appears small and intimate making one feel large and important. Our room was small, the bathroom and closets where not as large as well but again, everything felt comfortable. The bed was most comfortable of all allowing us deep rest to recover from all the walking. And our view of Marina Bay made the mornings and evening very relaxing. The pool was just right with a beautiful backdrop of MBS. Most important was the attentiveness of the staff. It was my birthday week and  though we misunderstood and messed up our reservations at one of the restaurant, the manager came…",4,March 2019,
An Exceptional Experience,Lupin,This hotel is simply perfect in every way.  Six out of five in every category.  The decor in both public areas and the room is discrete and serene.  You feel relaxed from the moment you walk into the hotel.  The beautiful Club room is an oasis of peace and calm  The floor to ceiling view from our room was just breathtaking. There is a high level of comfort in the room which is very quiet both externally and with barely a sound from the air conditioning.  The food and drink is of exceptional quality and beautifully prepared. The service by all the staff in all areas is exemplary.

Good hotel,derekm6,"We arrived early off a cruise and was allocated a room straight away. We were upgraded to a Marina view room with fabulous views. This is a 5* hotel and the reception areas, service and prices back this up. A few things need to be worked on to get 5 blips though. The room, although spacious was a tad outdated with some electrical switches not working on my side of the bed. which meant getting up to switch off lights. Bathroom also looked outdated but everything worked. Pillow selection was poor with only 2 soft pillows per person. We went for a drink in the MO bar but left because $30+ for a drink was extortionate. It was also so dark we could not read the drinks menu. Breakfast was good but the area is so disjointed it turned out to be a walking marathon as butter is not next…",4,March 2019,
Remarkable for the helpfulness of staff throughout the hotel,Phillipa S,This review relates to a short stopover in Singapore.  We arrived very early in the morning so had booked our room for the night before in order to be able to go straight to our room after a long haul flight.  The check in staff were friendly and welcoming and the room an oasis of peace and comfort. All facilities were of top quality and the freshness and cleanliness were appreciated. The pool was accessible and had a good range of loungers and cabanas with attendants on hand to ensure that fresh towels and beverages were always available and also to manage the turnover of the loungers.  We ate a very delicious meal at the Dolce Vita restaurant on level 5.  Great atmosphere and delicious food.,5,March 2019,
Wow Wow WOW,Peter W,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  From the time you walk through the front reception doors it is just wow!  As we had booked a Club Lounge room our check-in was completed seamlessly in our room by a very friendly and competent staff member.  Check-in also included a full run-through of the suite including lighting, entertainment and amenities. A little celebratory cake on the table was also a nice gesture.    The Melt Cafe International buffet breakfast is superb and the hotel is well located with plenty of external dining options available.

outstanding and excellent as always,Peter S,"Again I stayed at the MO SIN as usually every two years foe a long time. I had a German VIP Group with (as nearly always) and we were 10 people altogether. As usually I booked the Oriental Club Lounge, a must for the distinctive traveller. The MO is always very busy but you get fantastic service in the Lounge with high quality food and drinks. The service is unbeatable though sometimes the Lounge is quite crowded. Nevertheless I am convinced its the best place to stay in SIN. Thanks to everybody, especially the Ladies at the Lounge desk and Yaja in service, he is an institution. A wonderful Pool area, a Italian restaurant by the pool and excellent Restaurants all over the Hotel convince to stay.",5,February 2019,
Perfect Location and exceptional service,BrianSydneyAustralia,"I was lucky enough to combine a work trip with some personal time in Singapore and decided to stay the whole time at the Mandarin Oriental. We utilised the club lounge and had a room on the top floor.  The staff were friendly and professional and from the second day remembered preferences for breakfast and drinks in the lounge. They made us feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. The Gym was clean and organised and the pool area was beautiful. Located within walking distance from most of Singapore’s must-see areas, it is the ideal place to base yourself. Also , in Singapore, the taxis are so cheap that if you decide not to walk, almost everything is under $10 in a taxi and the drivers are so friendly that you want to round up and give them a tip. Would definitely book…",5,March 2019,
Good not great!,Food9er,"Location was excellent. Close to everything I needed for business for my 10 days in Singapore.  Room was fine, clean and well appointed.  Breakfast was just ok.. really not up to par for the hotel and the rest of the accommodations.  Check in and check out was seamless and fast.  Valets and taxis were always timely and pleasant.  Really other than the below average breakfast the hotel, staff and amenities were really nice and the price was right on expectation. I would go back again but only if I received a favorable rate. The hotel is in need of a makeover but it’s not anything terrible just not up to other Mandarin standards. We had an apartment near the Mandarin Oriental in NYC and there is really no comparison in the two hotels. Having said that the mandarin orientalists…",4,March 2019,
Melt Cafe - disappointment,sammiemitch1973,"So we opted to do the Sunday brunch at Melt Cafe. It didn't start well at all, served hot champagne 🥂 warning bells started to ring. There was a large table with 5 very loud men on it and the staff literally all of them pandered too all their needs and no one else's. We had to ask numerous times for water and even serve ourselves which is fine but when you are spending $210 per head you expect a little better. The food was pretty OK especially the Indian section.  Really not very happy at all to have spent all that money for poor service.",1,March 2019,
Top Hotel,Paul H,"From the moment you are greeted by the man in the red coat you are getting the 5 star treatment. The reception is spacious, welcoming and efficient and although we were early booking in we were not kept waiting unnecessarily as our room became available. The choice of where to eat is wide though we limited ourselves to the Melt Cafe and Dolce Vita. The former provided an excellent and generous lunch in delightful surroundings adjacent to the pool area. The latter provided a bewildering choice at Breakfast and in the evening. Special mention must be made of the chef who took a personal interest in ensuring my wife Gluten Free requirement was taken seriously. Our late check out request was dealt with courteously and to our satisfaction. Highly recommended.",5,February 2019,
A good luxury brand,Radharamanan Panicker,A very nice comfortable and cosy hotel with very responsive and friendly staff. The hotel is located close to Marina bay and to the shopping mall.

Disappointed with food/drink services,jgrossi59,"The arrival itself was nice and the check in was quick and efficient. The room was excellent and clean without any remarks. The service at the restaurant during the breakfast was tragic and I spent a lot of time for the simplest orders. Also, the evening meal was the same problem. The hotel is pleasant and in a beautiful place but disappointed with the service and I did not get what I paid. Unfortunately wasted money for dinner.",3,March 2019,
Incredible Service!,Christie Z,"Everyone we interacted with was incredibly kind and professional here. We were so impressed by the level if attention to our needs. At Melt, Chef Jeffery paid such special attention to my husband's dairy allergy! He walked him through each buffet station to let him know what he could and couldn't eat. Alex the Assistant Manager was also amazing. Excellent service and food! We loved our experience. Also, all of the desserts blew my mind. Lastly, we told them upon check-in that we were on our honeymoon and they sent up a bottle of wine and special cake for us. Not to mention, the turn down service was so thoughtful and meticulous. Hat's off to the housekeeping staff! Thanks for everything! ",5,March 2019,
Stay on Club Floor Provided Excellent Value,BobSmith174,"We spent four nights at the Mandarin Oriental during Lunar New Year week. Our view from the high floor Club Floor overlooking Marina Bay gave us an outstanding view of the Lunar New Year festivities including three nights of fireworks going off right outside our window. Magical! Staying on the Club Floor with access to the Club Lounge was a definite plus. We were well looked after by the Club Lounge staff who were on top of our preferences from day one. While all the Club Lounge staff were very good, Jessica Elsaputra was exceptional and added to the enjoyment of our stay.",4,February 2019,
Excellent stay.,Maureen D,We recently stayed at the Mandorin Oriental  Hotel following a cruise. We stayed in a club room. We were not disappointed From check in to check out Everything was perfect. The staff were all very pleasant polite and helpful. We ate breakfast in the club. The buffet was good and the food we ordered was freshly cooked and delicious 😋 We spent a short time at the outside pool area it was quite busy.  The pool attendant was particularly good and found us sun beds and fresh towels very quickly. We were great full was nice  to relax after a busy day. Thank you to all of you for making our stay special. Would certainly recommend this hotel.,5,March 2019,
Fantastic stay,Aine E,"As a family of 6 we had a fantastic stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Our rooms were amazing, the staff were very attentive, towels changed twice daily, and pool staff constantly offering service. Even the morning after my brothers wedding the pool staff where very attentive holding me 6 sunloungers. Pool area fantastic and there wasn’t a day that the pool staff didn’t keep us a bed hammock. Dolce vita bar by the pool was gorgeous for poolside lunch. On checkout after a shopping spree the girls at front desk where very professional in looking after my purchases. Thank you Mandarin Oriental. Looking forward to going back!!! ",5,February 2019,
Excellent Hotel,Cazwell,"Travelled to Singapore for a cruise and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental. What a well managed hotel, from the staff to the food, it was first class.

High Charges for VERY Low Quality Food,Christina N,"The bed is comfortable, the room is spacious and the hotel is in walking distance to great shopping. That being said, the breakfast, although vast in it's offerings, lacked in quality and I ordered room service where the food was simply awful. I didn't think fish and chips could be so poorly done, but I was wrong. In addition, the prices listed on the menu were actually double once I checked out, not just for me, but for my friend who was also staying there. I was put on the 7th floor with a window facing the pool and all the pool guests facing my room. I felt extremely uncomfortable opening my window while walking around the room without being fully clothed. I understand that Singapore is expensive, but with great quantity, there should be great quality.",2,March 2019,
Centrally Located Luxury Hotel,NASu,Not recommend for Vegetarian Guests.  Was served Non Veg Food when I specifically ordered Veg Food in In Room Dining.  The approach of the staff after the blunder / corrective action was also very dismal.,3,March 2019,
Wonderful 3 days,W.F. A. N.,Pre our QM2 cruise we spend some fabulous days in Singapore. The hotel is greatly enjoyable and well situated for all the splendid sights.

Great hotel - average gym,Gerardo,"Wonderful hotel - location, service, room quality, restaurants (Dolce Vita Italian restaurant in particular) and decor.

revisit to MO singapore,Sukit P,"I usually stay here when I have business trip around Suntec area.  Also, I use a benefit of fine hotel and resorts from AMEX Platinum giving me a promotion of staying 4 pay 3 which is quite good.  The hotel has good location with an excellent view of marina and garden by the bay.  Room size is average to other 5 star hotels.  Service from staff is excellent as their standard.  The only thing I don't quite satisfy is  1. business center; they have a limitation on printing for 5 pages per stay!!  I think limiting on printing is fine but they should impose it by night of stay.  I stayed 4 nights but I could print only 5 pages for free (same as guest staying 1 night)!!  This is quite unbelievable for me.  2. breakfast is not impressive.  It might be impressive on quantity of food…",4,February 2019,
What a fantastic hotel.,thetomcampbell,"Every staff member you interact with genuinely wants to help you. Often anticipating your needs, like bringing cold water to your sun bed without being asked. It is the attention to detail that makes this hotel special. Check out is at 12.00, our flight was at 11.45 PM. We were told to carry on using the pool facilities and then come and ask for a ""shower room"" where when after retrieving our luggage we had an hour to shower and change ready for our flight home. It was a wonderful end to a very pleasant stay.",5,March 2019,
"ELEGANT AND CLASSY, BUT COMPETITION IS NIPPING AT YOUR LOUBOUTIN HEELS",Lady M,"Don't get me wrong - the MO Singapore is a very classy and elegant hotel.  Located in an area of many other hotels including the Ritz Carlton, Conrad and lesser properties such as the Pan Pacific and Marina Mandarin.  The fit out is of the highest standard and the prices are set to match.  It's not the the cheapest hotel in Singapore and, having not been in Singapore for almost 18 years, it's amazing to see how much the city has grown into a huge tourist destination in the Asia Pacific region.  Along with this growth comes the competition from many other hotels in the city - Singapore has a plethora of hotel choices and I guess what I'm saying is how (for the price of the room rate) do you stand out from the crowd.  The MO Singapore does this very well - but for me it fell short…",4,February 2019,
Amazing service,Stephen S,Have stayed in quite a few hotels across the world but the Mandarin beats them all for service .Amazing staff who just cannot do enough to help .Can’t pick any staff out in particular because everyone we met were pleasant and really on the ball .Its a stunning hotel it’s interior is a very pleasant surprise considering its exterior it’s just a big concrete box ( a box in a great location ).The general manager needs to make sure he keeps these staff they are undoubtedly his biggest asset,5,March 2019,
Very good location,Dizzie's Mom,The hotel probably has the best location in terms of navigating the major sightseeing spots in Singapore. Very close to many shopping malls and also to the Merlion Park and the Marina Bay View room has an amazing view. The rooms are a bit outdated and sofa has some pld stains. Offers reasonable breakfast buffet selection. Not the best hotel experience I've haf but definitely worth checking out this property.,3,March 2019,
Great Place to stsy,DavidXH558,"Ideally situated for most things in Singapore and within walking distance of major sites. We had a harbour view which gave us a magnificent view of the the evening light and laxer show. Food in the hotel is good but pricey, as one would expect. If you want to experience the local culture eat at Gluttons Makkan centre just across the road where you can eat well very cheaply. We used it a lot. The rooms in the hotel are beautiful and everything to be expected. You can walk across the helical bridge near hotel to Marina Sands with its shopping mall and the gardens, a must visit. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again when in Singapore.",5,March 2019,
It's All About The Staff,BurleighSurfer,"This is our ""go-to"" hotel in Singapore , having stayed there a number of times and most recently for 8 nights. We were travelling with our elderly parents and so had 2 rooms. Although there are newer , flashier hotels in Singapore with larger more modern rooms the MO really does punch above its weight. The location is amazing , and get a room with a view over the bay and you will be treated to one of the best views in Singapore. But what sets this hotel apart from the rest is the exemplary staff. From the moment you arrive until you leave the staff of this hotel make you feel so very welcome and that absolutely nothing is too much trouble. It is so rare to be made to feel special in a large hotel these days. The facilities - pool , gym , spa , restaurants are all first rate. We…",5,February 2019,
Great start to a holiday to australasia.,stevesutherland2017,"Loved this hotel, the staff, and the location, could walk to most places easily. Had a concierge level room, with excellent views of the harbour, and access to excellent facilities. Great room, great service, helpful staff. Didn’t particularly like Moretons the Steak House, thought the service was good, but the food was poor, and expensive, but this was the exception. Enjoyed the Singapore sling at Raffles, literally a short walk away from the hotel.",5,January 2019,
Unforgettable experience,Stephanie_18,"I was wondering to book with Marina Bay sands but I am happy not to. Mandrin Oriental is stunning. The view is amazing. I could see the whole city just from my room. Everytimes i woke up and open my eyes, the view is just wow. Thanks to the house keeping lady that gave me a rose in the morning just because she though i am pretty. Hotel is so big but every staff is so friendly. I will keep choosing Mandrin Oriental for my next trip in Singapore.",5,April 2018,
Awesome hotel with excellent view,Jonthlee68,"Booked a room at the club floor. It was one of the best club room I have tried so far. For the evening cocktail, the lounge serve Ruinart Champagne. The food and canapes was good. The service by the staff was fantastic. The only downside we have experience d was that the coffee came lukewarm until we have to specifically request for a hot one. Breakfast at the lounge was great. They have a menu for you to place your order. Most hotels served you a small spread of buffet.  The pillows in the room were way too soft.   The swimming pool was crowed because it has a wonderful view of the marina. I think they have the best view among the hotels in the bay area.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,February 2019,
A truly exceptional hotel,LP_WestYorks_UK,Sadly our stay at the Mandarin Oriental was very brief so we were only able to enjoy this fabulous hotel for a short time.   We arrived for a one night stopover after a holiday in Australia and checked in late afternoon.  From the moment we entered the reception we were impressed.  The member of staff on reception was courteous and welcoming and thanked us for choosing the hotel.  Although we were only staying one night we were grateful to be told we had been upgraded to a Club Room with Marina view (we had booked a Club Room with City View).  On entering the room we were blown away by the magnificent view of the water and the Marina Bay Sands hotel through the floor to ceiling windows.  Later in the evening we were able to enjoy the light show over the marina from the comfort…,5,February 2019,
Excellent in every way,Kimmy2004,"I recently spent two nights in the Mandarin Oriental in a club room. Everything about it was superb from the check in in the lounge to the check out in the lounge. The club facilities are fantastic with wines, beers, soft drinks and tea and coffee available all day. The food is of the highest quality and plentiful. The atmosphere in the lounge is peaceful and relaxing, I really could not fault anything. If you are in Singapore and you want a club room then you will not get better than this. I stayed in the Marina Bay Sands after this and they were incomparable, if i could have gone back to the Mandarin then I would have done in a heartbeat.  ",5,February 2019,
Fabulous Stay,G Black,"We had a fantastic 4 nights stay here. Great location. Room on 19th floor with stunning Marina Bay views. Well worth paying the supplement just for those views. Cleanliness and service was excellent. Beds are so comfortable. Staff polite and friendly. Bay @ 5 bar is great to relax with a drink. We had dinner at Dolce Vita one night and food/service was very good.  Pool area is very nice and we relaxed there for a couple of hours each day. Winko one of the pool/bar attendants was so friendly and attentive and looked after us exceptionally well. Full marks to Winko, he is a credit to the hotel. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here on our next visit.",5,March 2019,
Breakfast let's this hotel down!,Lily186543,"Used to love love love The MO chain and have stayed at their hotels in London,Hong Kong,Barcelona and hosted my daughters wedding in The MO in Las Vegas(before it became Waldorf)so you you can imagine what that cost--- Our room in Singapore was great as expected,the pool was great,The Cherry Garden was enjoyable and we were very well looked after by Alex and team in a The MO bar we also ate there. Breakfast as has been said many times before is quite frankly a shambles!Tables not cleaned properly no teapots available on 2 mornings and although they serve until 10.30 don't expect eggs after 9.45 as the egg station is closed!!On the whole very very poor for a Mandarin.It has made me think twice about staying at one again I think The Four Seasons chain has become more appealing.",3,February 2019,
Get a room with a view,avid_traveler_2007,"Top notch, well-situated hotel, with a fabulous view of the marina. Everything is high quality, from the moment you arrive to the time you depart. My only wish is that a king room should have a king bed, not two twin beds pushed together. There’s always an annoying gap and we dropped a phone between the beds by accident. Otherwise, everything about the hotel is wonderful and I would stay here again. We did not get a club level room so I cannot review the club lounge or club amenities.",5,February 2019,
Not as I expected,craped,"We arrived at MO at around 19:00 as advised by email two days prior as a courtesy to the hotel. We had our passports taken at the counter where nothing seemed to happen?  We watched others served and realised we had been forgotten.  It was at this point I asked 'shouldn't we be checked in at the Club Lounge?' At that point we were whisked away to the Club Lounge on level 19. We waited a further 30 minutes before being checked in.  We were then assigned our room, we had booked a Club Marina Bay Room.  We were given the keys and not shown to our room which I thought was odd.  Upon entering we looked out the window to find it was a classic Ocean View Room with a view of the Singapore Flyer and freeway.  My wife went to the Club Lounge where she stated we had the wrong room and was…",3,February 2019,
Great Hotel,Navigator48354280957,Well run property with great service.  Expensive but is worth the money overall.  Very close to most things needed in the area along with easy access to other places with the staff support.  Food is very expressive in this property which is really my oy complaint.  Other than that overall a solid property with great staff and service,5,February 2019,
WORLD CLASS,ellmktg,"Physically and architecturally this hotel is spectacular.  The public spaces and the rooms are outstanding.  We were fortunate enough to get a room on the 20th floor facing the water and the view adds greatly to the experience.  Everything about the hotel is among the best available.  One problem we found is that we went to speak to the concierge on three different occasions, and all three times he was talking to another guest and it took up to 15 minutes to get to him.  With everything else they offer, it is surprising there is not more than one concierge.  By the way, his recommendations were exceptional.  Hotel has the best linens we ever slept on.",5,February 2019,
Good but not exceptional,suiss2018,"The highlight: Well placed side Marina architecture impressive room well insulated from the noise.

Room card not functioning,HSHA,"My room was not able to be opened 2 times with the room card key.  I was at level 15 so went down 2 times.  It was simply the delegates in my trip have the same name with me so the card identified only one name. Overall, the room was pleasant.",4,March 2018,
Chinese New Year fun,plrloves2travel,"We decided to visit Singapore In February without realizing at first that it was Chinese New Year which turned out to be fantastic time to visit.  We settled on the Mandarin after another hotel was sold out, but it turned out to be a great choice.  From the time we walked into the hotel, we were welcomed with open arms by the lovely young woman who was working at the desk.  The hotel is in a great location.  We do a lot of walking on our trips and we felt that it was very centrally located.  We had a Chinese New Year’s package which included breakfast at Melt every morning.  The breakfast had something for everyone, if you can’t find something you like here, you never will.  I had some of the things I would only have on vacation like Dim Sum for breakfast which was delicious. …",5,February 2019,
Not at the level of other MOs,Carlos T,Unfortunately this Mandarin Oriental is not at the level of my previous experiences with them.   The hotel is very dated and the rooms feel very small. Very from the 80s. The whole property definitely needs to be redone.   With Singapore having so many more recent and options at the same price I wouldn’t recommend choosing the MO; which is unfortunate because all their other properties we have stayed at have been excellent.   Only pros are the views from the pool (although the pool is always very crowded).,2,January 2019,
Centrally located and spectacular view,Liz T,"The hotel is centrally located to popular sights like the Art and Science museum and Garden By the Bay. The MRT (Esplanade) and Marina mall is steps away from the hotel. There is a currency exchange office in the mall with much better rates (if needed) and many other stores and eateries. Access to pedestrian walkway for those wanting to get in a run is just outside the hotel door. Hotel has classy Asian decor with many fresh orchid displays. The marina view rooms offer outstanding views of both the city and Marina Sands Hotel, the best of both views! Breakfast buffet has fantastic selection of food and were very accommodating if we wanted to get an espresso to take back to our room. Overall we had an amazing stay and with all women traveling felt very safe at the Mandarin.",5,February 2019,
Avoid this hotel,John B,"No idea how this is considered a five star property by Forbes or is even part of Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program. It is a substandard property. Not a luxury hotel. Not up to mandarin oriental standard. Bathroom ceiling and grout covered in mold. Shower door does not seal flooding the floor and the frayed bath mats. Towels on par with your local gym (you know, the small and scratchy kind that deter theft). Mattress so worn that when lying down you feel as if upside down from sloping springs. Atrium design acts as an echo chamber, especially when children are allowed to treat the areas outside the restaurants as a playground, running and screaming at full volume at 10pm. Multiple polite calls to front desk to ask for assistance to address this disturbance went unheeded. Would…",1,February 2019,
Nice hotel by Marina Bay,Manuel Marques,"Well located, nice pool and kind staff.  The breakfast is amazing, so much variety and good quality.  Rooms are calling for an update, but still very nice. Well located, walking distance to everywhere! Good proposition in Singapore! ",4,February 2019,
Loved it,John G,"We  were here twice in the last month on a break in our trip to Australia. The rooms are superb and, especially if on a late flight back, access to the club lounge is a great bonus. the MO Bar serves excellent coffee in the day time and even better cocktails - I liked their virgin Mary mix even- in the evening. The pool area is great and roomy and the service there is first class. Breakfast in the Melt Cafe is a delight with huge choice both in terms of national dishes or just simple continental breakfast. Concierge was very helpful and the doormen are really friendly and efficient.",5,February 2019,

Our third stay here!,tasannie,"We spent four nights here,based on the fact that we had two previous excellent stays here. We thoroughly enjoyed this stay, check in was seamless, our room was facing Marina Bay we had booked this room with floor to ceiling windows and amazing views, particularly as we were there during Chinese New Year and nightly fireworks which were some of the best we have seen.

This is how they treat to their club room guest,Eddy Huang,"I booked the ""Club Marina Bay room"",and this is how the disaster begin. Pros: 1.The location is good.... 2.The view from the marina bay room is fantastic as well....That's all. Cons: 1.Front desk give me the room on level ""8"" at the first time I check in-this is what they said they will give you the highest floor if you book the club room..... 2.They keep me waiting to almost 5pm to change to the correct room(the room at the level 19) without doing nothing but keep saying sorry to keep you wait 3.Housekeeping ring our doorbell say they have to make up the room at 3:30pm(club room is guaranteed to late check-out at 4pm)-this is the first time in my life that there is a staff ringing your room to remind you to check out In conclusion, the more money you spent the more…",1,February 2019,
False start but things improved,Topmerc,"Quite difficult to review this as earlier in our trip we had stayed at the excellent Fullerton Bay Hotel so we were always making comparisons. Check-in was awkward as the receptionist wasn't initially aware that we had already arranged for a late check-out and was busy trying to sell it to us. The club room service in the evening was also lacking, not least because we hadn't been informed of how things worked. Overall, the service was highly professional but just a bit lacking in warmth. The room was good (though not a patch on the Fullerton bay) and the views from the 21st floor were stunning. Breakfast in the Club Lounge was also very good. We didn't have another meal at the hotel during our brief stay but there looked to be a good choice of restaurants. We did though use the…",4,February 2019,
Elegant Stay in the Heart of Marina Sands,TwoCavaliers,"We ""jumped ship"" and left a cruise several days early, so our reservation at the Mandarin Oriental was very last-minute.  We couldn't have been happier with our choice -- everything was walkable (even in the hot, humid weather) and the hotel was centrally located to so much more.  We opted for the Oriental Club level and that was a wise choice.  Gracious service, an expansive breakfast, free cocktails and appetizers for happy hour, and coffee/tea/soft drinks whenever you wanted them.  The staff -- especially Matt, Andrew and Jessica -- were outstanding and always extremely helpful.  As others have noted, the design of the hotel is very ""Hyatt from the 80s"" with all of the rooms off of a 21-story atrium.  That said, the public spaces were modern and elegant.  The pool attendants…",5,February 2019,

My most favorite would be the pool...I must say Mandarin Oriental has the best pool view in SG, you can see both the Marina bay view and Marina Bay Sands from the pool. This hotel locates in the perfect location, it's very close to all the major attraction in Singapore such as Marina Bay, The Sands and the shopping centers. However, the only thing that was a little bit disappointed was the quality of the bed and pillows. I was so surprised for how poor of these stuffs in this luxurious hotel to the point that I had to call the hotel and asked to change the pillow (and almost the bed, it's really soft and didn't feel like I was staying in Mandarin Oriental Hotel at all.",5,February 2019,

Good but needs a few updates,spongerobn,"I have stayed here many times for work but this was myfirst family trip. We booked a city suite room for ourselves and 2yr old son. The booking was simple and requets for a rollaway bed and bed guards were answered very quickly. The hotel itself is fantastic, but we felt the quality of the furnishings in the room was not up to the normal MO standard and could do with updating.  The breakfast buffet is fantastic and you are spoilt for choice. So, what is the biggest problem? The pool menu. The pool is great and very family friendly.

We enjoyed the light shows and view of the marina from our room. We stayed in a Marina Bay Suite which had a small patio so we were able to enjoy the sounds of the light shows too. Beds and pillows were extremely comfortable.  We ate at 3 of the restaurants in the hotel. This was a hit or miss experience. The Melt had a great breakfast buffet and several of the ladies knew us by name after the first day and greeted us each morning.

Great location,Norton999,This is a well located hotel down by Marina Bay. It’s a short walk to the Marina Sands mega shop and hotel complex and is near the art and science museum . The big wheel is not far and the MRT is close by. The hotel itself is architecturally interesting inside with an enormous triangular atrium. Service is MOs usual high standard and everything runs well. Rooms are expensive and eating and drinking is extremely expensive. However if you want to treat yourself it’s a great place to do it. It’s a nice hotel brand that is generally a cut above the others and this branch is no exception. Would definitely go back.,5,January 2019,
Fabulous stay at the Mandarin Oriental,Helen D,"The quality of the service was excellent, this is clearly a very well run hotel - we were glad we stayed here instead of the Marina Bay Sands, as it was much more intimate, rather than the railway concourse feel we got at the Sands!

Yes, it’s not the most modern, and it could do with a refresh in some areas, but the service more than makes up for it. It feels like a second home.   It starts at the door - there’s nothing like being genuinely welcomed “home” each day by the doormen. To be honest this is what keeps us coming back - being treated like an individual.   The club lounge is well worth it - it’s one of the best club lounges in my experience. The food is excellent with good variety and plenty of it.

Our flight was very late and we were offered the room until 5 which we accepted. We were then offered another room at 7.00pm just to take a shower before our departure which was very much appreciated as always so much more comfortable to fly home having just had a shower.

It's an old hotel by Singapore standards, but it still provides a level of relaxed elegance that we really appreciate. What really made the experience for us was the wonderful pool area. So few hotels can afford the space to have a generous sized pool on the ground floor, and the views here are spectacular. We found the service to be impeccable; attentive without being overbearing. We had a suite, which was a little dated perhaps in terms of decor, but nevertheless very luxurious and sumptuously comfortable.

Wonderful Mandarin Oriental,PottyP,"  First visit staying at an MO and couldn't have been better.  We had upgraded to a Club Room and so pleased we did - the extra benefits and service are what makes this hotel stand out.  Granted whilst it might not be the prettiest building from the outside, and a tad dated inside, it's location is perfect, and the view from the bedroom floor to ceiling window is nothing short of spectacular!  With club access we had impeccable service and the added extra of a delightful afternoon tea and cocktails and hourduvre's in the evening in a quiet and elegant setting.  Should we be this way again, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thank you to all the staff who have made our stay so memorable!  PS: the pool and it's setting is pretty spectacular too!

Quality quality quality,Caribbean Traveler,It’s not a pretty hotel and to be Honest I expected my first trip to Singapore to be staying in something a bit less functional and a bit more Asian... but the service is extraordinary and the rooms are excellent. When I arrived at 12.15 and said can I have a room.. they at first said it wasn’t ready yet but went off immediately to see what could be done.  Coming back with a smile the girl said sir you have a ices. View room booked that’s not ready but if you accept an upgrade to a better room but with city view we can accommodate you right now... excellent solution.  Room is fantastic spotless and great view actually.  Pool area is extremely nice and good sunbeds but was saturday and I’m not sure if the hotel has day guests or a lot of families but it was a bit noisy. That said…,5,January 2019,
Mandarin Oriental Singapore maintains the brand's high standards with truly exceptional staff. Highly Recommended,TCK83HK,"The Mandarin Oriental trademark logo is taken very seriously at the Singapore outpost of the chain. The entire design of the 500+ room hotel, by American architect John Portman, is a gargantuan homage to the traditional open fan shape. Strange as it may sound, this unusual construction works well, with a soaring quadrant-shaped atrium, serviced by a sleek bank of glass-walled elevators, gliding silently almost twenty storeys skywards. Breathtaking.   We were initially worried that we would not feel completely at home in such a huge hotel, which has a clear key emphasis on banqueting and events for local Singaporeans, as was evidenced on every single day of our week’s stay in the run up to Christmas.  However, Mandarin Oriental’s customary emphasis on service ensured that we felt…",5,December 2018,
Perfect stay,Freedom747710,"This hotel is located in a very central location and the Marina is within walking distance. The breakfast choice in the morning was excellent, the room comfortable and very quite. The cleanliness was incredible and the staff very attentive. It was very relaxing to hang by the pool and I loved being a guest at the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore. I would strongly recommend it. ",5,January 2019,
Class Act - great experience,Andrew632014,"We booked a Club Room which was worth the extra £££ because of the fantastic service we experienced by the Team working in the Club Lounge.

Family stay at Mandarin Oriental,Navigate39458784093,We stayed as family of 6 for Christmas. We had no previous experience with the hotel but we needed rooms that can accomodate 3 people and Mandarin was one of very few that could do it. We loved location with easy access to the bay. Breakfasts and dinners were lovely. We also enjoyed swimming pool with very efficient and helpful staff - there were always free beds. Nice cafe and bar at the pool. I can really recommend this hotel to families.,5,December 2018,
Absolutely Fantastic!,Paulina W,"Had a nice stay at the mandarin Singapore. Having stayed at the mandarin orientel in Bangkok and Tokyo, we were expecting great things. Unfortunately our 1 bed suite had a massive stain on the carpet, so we didn’t get off to a great start. We mentioned at check out and there was not much of a response. However everything else went smoothly.   The hotel has the most amazing breakfast! Probably the best breakfast buffet ever.  It’s worth stay g there for the breakfast alone!",4,April 2018,
Classy,Rory James DOYLE,Classy five star iconic Mandarin Oriental hotel in Singapore offering a five star hotel experience at five star rates. Lobby is quiet dark and subdued which is not to my liking but is obviously popular with other guests.,4,January 2019,
excellent hotel~!,Explore52509656004,"The Marina Bay View from the pool and the room was really fantastic. All the staff were nice and the breakfast was excellent. I didn't know the traffic was inconvenient because I just took a taxi, but the distance to the subway station was a little, so I would have to walk a little if I took the subway.",5,January 2019,

Singapore's Finest,steve l,"We stayed at this superb hotel in 2013 and as we were going back to Singapore we decide to stay here given the experience we had all those years ago.  Not much has changed sinec our last visit. In a word, exceptional. We have been lucky enough to have stayed in some absolutely stunning places around the world, and each of these places have something that has made them special. For us, the Mandarin Oriental is now our first choice of any place we would recommend to other travellers.  There are other hotels that have history or are extremely ornate and have that ""wow"" factor, but when you combine everything such as location, service, quality, understated class, facilities and friendliness of staff, then this is our undoubted first preference.  During the entire time we were here…",5,January 2019,
We always stay in this hotel when we are in Singapore,Ted M,"We are frequent travellers and when we are in Singapore we always choose this superb hotel.

"Fabulous Location, room, pool",JustyRomy,"I stayed at Mandarin only for 3 nights, and I can say it’s a fabulous hotel. The room was stunning, with a wonderful wiev over Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands. I must say that I enjoyed their pool much more than the highest pool in the world, just across the street. The hotel is located walking distance to Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer, and all the main attractions. I recomand it!!!",5,August 2018,
Staff not welcoming,N. Nasr,It was our first trip to singapore and the staff of the hotel were not welcoming and the check-in process was bad. We were taken to one room with all our luggage and without the staff checking our booking information or even showing us around. We ended up doing this process all over again at the reciption !,2,January 2019,
