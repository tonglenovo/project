The hotel itself is a fantastic building, has a really nice atrium and a nice feel. The staff were great with our kids, they got free ice-cream almost whenever they wanted. The interconnecting rooms that we got were great, with fantastic views.","The only issue that we had is the way that the bar (which I think is a franchised whisky store) operates. Kids aren't allowed in there, but they aren't allowed to sell to anyone who doesn't sit in there. That means we had to sit in the restaurant, surrounded by people eating from the buffet, with slow service and then left when the restaurant closed.

Elegant historic hotel in a superb location.,10,"The Fullerton is a beautiful hotel with so much charm and elegance. The view from our balcony was amazing- looking out to Marina Bay Sands and the nightly light show. The buffet breakfast was excellent. We found the staff to mostly be really attentive and friendly. From the restaurant wait staff who remembered my daughter's request for iced almond milk latte, the friendly pool attendant who had a chat each day, the horticulturist who gave us a tour of the little ""Fullerton farm"" and explained the medicinal and culinary uses of the herbs grown there. The location was great for daily walks along the river or around Marina Bay or up to Orchard Road and access to restaurants and Hawker market.

"Brilliant hotel, fantastic position and great old Singaporean style.",9,Nothing else really to say here about the Fullerton Hotel - everything was excellent.,"The only disappointment (apart from checking out), was that the Fullerton has leased out their former cocktail bar and it is now a whiskey bar called ""Signature Reserve"".  Apart from a massively impressive selection of whiskeys, this bar offers bar snacks and meals. However, the steaks (all three offerings are the same steak, just differently prepared) we had were poorly prepared (we ordered the Cajun style and they were just normal steaks), presented in an odd manner (on a cold slate tile plate), cooked incorrectly (ordered both medium-well and received both at a touch over rare, medium rare at best) and very fatty.
As this bar isn't actually part of the Fullerton, then this is not a poor mark against them, but since the bar is in the hotel lobby, it could be mistaken as part of the hotel and guests may get the wrong impression.",John,Couple,Premier Courtyard Room,2,"29, 2022",Australia,au,[List]
Upmarket hotel with a few flaws that you can overcome.,10,"Facilities and room were exceptional, loved the pool.  The food and drink quality was very good.  Hotel in a fantastic position and is simply spectacular to stay in.  One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in overall.  The high tea was good, the staff were mostly great.  I would stay here again.  I will say I really enjoyed the atmosphere at the pool which was great.",The hotel accidently took $5000 extra from our account.  Which is fine that we had the money but seriously they weren't in a hurry to give it back.  Service at the dinner buffet was terrible (even though everything else was great).  Trying to get a glass of wine was a nightmare and should have been simple.  The staff panicked when I walked up to the bar to buy a drink.  It shouldn't be like that.,Darren,Couple,Taste the Good Life Package - Premier Courtyard Room with Complimentary $200 SGD net flexible Dining Credits per stay,8,"27, 2022",Australia,au,[List]

ハードウェアは最高だがソフトウェアに相当の劣化が見られる。,4,マーライオンの直近で、名だたる歴史をもつ重厚な建物であり、シンガポールの象徴１つと言っても過言ではなかろう。部屋は快適で申し分なく、これぞ高級ホテルと呼ぶにふさわしいものだった。11月半ばとあって、南国でもホテル内部はクリスマス一色、いろいろな催し物が開かれ、素敵な雰囲気だった。,2013年秋に家内と一緒に宿泊した時は、ドアマン・受付・ベルキャプテンらの完璧な連携に感動したが、今回は「え？」と思う出来事が３つもあった。(1) 事前に伝えた通り14:00に到着したところ、「まだ部屋が整っていないので待って欲しい、準備できたら携帯電話に連絡する」と告げられたが、いつまで待っても連絡が無い。公式チェックイン時間(15h)が迫った14:55に受付に再び出向くと別のスタッフに「ああ、もう準備できてましたよ」と言われた。 (2)入室して30分後、ドアにノックがあり、返事する前に掃除のおばちゃんがいきなり合鍵で入ってきて、「ミニバーの補給を忘れた」という。もっと安いホテルだって、ありえない事態だろう。(3)部屋にキーカードが１枚（前の客のもの？）放置してあり、危うくそちらを持って外出するところだった。当然そちらでは鍵は開かないわけで、わざわざ客をトラブルに誘い込むような状況だった。以上、どれ１つとっても、超高級ホテルとしては、ありえないミスだと思う。,Makishima,Solo traveler,Postmaster Room,1,"24, 2019",Japan,jp,[List]

However, it was a disappointing experience. Most of the staff at the concierge was rude, not organised and not approachable. While waiting for check-in/out, there was no proper queue and the staff seem to enjoy letting their guest wait. Their tone was not friendly and they were not welcoming at all. During check out, it was crowded and only 3 out of the 5 counters were available. After waiting for about 15minutes, finally an unfriendly staff pointed to a small mail box and said, ""if you don't want to wait, you just drop your card into the express checkout. Otherwise you have to wait."" oh my goodness! The words for express checkout was too small to be visible! Only the staff who finally served me for check-in was helpful. We've booked for high tea on our check out day and she had made the necessary arrangements for late check out and 3 tables for our family for high tea. But on Sunday, we were told by the high tea section that we are not allowed to dine there because we are a family. And the manager was exceptionally rude to my husband, calling out to him ""Hey, boss."" as though the manager had no proper training in greeting their guests. And why as a family, we can't have high tea there? We didn't say we want to sit together. Worse still, we have made a reservation!

We thought since it's complimentary, why not try another one. However, at check out, we were informed that we need to pay for the extra set of breakfast. It was totally unexpected as we didn't want to order a 3rd set at first but were offered to do so without being informed about the additional charges.

Pleasant,6,"Hotel is at a strategic location where variety of food and restaurants are easily accessible. Also, view of marina bay was   superb.","1) There is a red stain on the couch in the room but overall clean.
2)there wasnt any comb and we had to request for it. 
3) I feel there should be a more transparent way of booking the facilities as people may have taken advantage of it. Called the reception and was told it was fully booked but when I went to take a look, there was not a single person using it. I feel it is good to have staff at swimming pool area to clear out unused towels else they could help allocate space for people. Also went to the pool at around 7pm and there were a lot of crows flying by to take a sip of water from the pool.
4) room was not really very sound proof as we could hear the bass of speakers from other rooms. 
5) Most disappointing was the ala carte buffet breakfast. I feel that the quantity could be in smaller portion so guests are able to really enjoy the buffet spread. Ordered laksa with a huge portion but comes with only a single prawn for the price of the buffet, it seemed a little ridiculous. 
The stay overall was okay but we are expecting a lot from fullerton and feel that the stay can be made much better.",Anonymous,Couple,,2,"10, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Better options available in Singapore than the Fullerton,7,"The bed and pillows were comfortable. The bathroom had a nice bathtub, separate shower (with stool), and enclosed bathroom.","I showed up to check in on time, but the room was not ready — for an hour. And I had tried to get a table at the dining space to wait with a coffee, however was told all the tables were reserved. So I sat at the back of the space at an uncomfortable workstation until an hour had passed. When returning to front desk, staff had informed me the room was still not ready. For the money one pays at The Fullerton, this was and is disappointing. 
Finally getting into a room, the experience is mixed. The room features old cabinetry, old tv, and dated interior aesthetic. 
The blanket was too thick and heavy, which made sleeping uneven. I’d get hot under the covers, then cold when tossing the blanket aside. 
The facilities are limited due to Covid safety measures, including small dining and drinks options in main ground level after 10 pm. 
In the evening I ordered a light meal and drinks via delivery app and when returning to my floor, I had kicked and almost tripped on a tray of dishes. Some idiot with no manners and consideration had left their dirty tray in the center of the foyer in front of the elevators. This is not the staff’s fault, but perhaps the hotel should provide explicit instructions to guests who order room service on what to do after they’re finished (if the Fullerton already doesn’t do so).",Anonymous,Couple,,1,"1, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Claustrophobic small room,7,The staff are great and there is personalised service from staff who clean the room.  The roof top bar is great and has lovely views across the river.,This is a beautiful historic hotel but not that comfortable.  The room had a very small bedroom and difficult to walk around the bed.  The bathroom was very large and lovely but was accessed by 6 narrow stairs.  There were no windows just 2 porthole type windows high up and the room was claustrophobic. So you need to upgrade to a much more expensive room to get something comfortable. The pool was lovely but there is nowhere to sit.

When we ordered the vegetarian bee hon in-room dining, as the alternative, the quality was very poor. The breakfast menu, which was charged by the room price, has no options for vegan. The staff helped us to get something for breakfast, like some pop cereals (low quality) and some bread and fruites, certainly didn't reach the value of the price we paid. The impossible Burger was not available although listed on the menu.

Pleasant,6.7,This hotel is in a amazing location and for anyone who wants to be walking distance to fantastic views the city has to offer and very close to the mrt transport links that take you around the city.,"The hotel room we stayed in 723 was very dated and in real need of a major update.
1. Furniture is old and worn out.
2. The bath tub failed to keep water in the tub because the plug to hold the water in even when pressed fully down still allowed water to escape.
3. Coffee cups/ curtain were very dirty.
4. Balcony door looked like a very old garden door. Even to the point where when I put my foot on it to step outside a part of it chipped off. Paint was falling off and both double doors looked worn out.
5. USB port next to the desk was not working.
6. The carpet felt and looked very old. Probably has not been changed in a good couple of years.
Overall I believe that this hotel relies on its history, location and exterior presence to draw people in however not concentrating on the hotel room and leaving them for dead is not the way. In order to bring in more millenniums like myself you guys needs to change the style and design of the rooms. Stop living in the 1990s and create a more simple, clean and modern design to the decor. 
Your staff are amazing and very polite and the customer service was top notch.

You couldn't turn off the light. We had to call reception and organise for someone to fix it - at midnight! We just wanted to sleep!!!!! The problem was fixed very quickly but it shouldn't have happened. Also the walls of the bathroom are very thin. When one of us was in the toilet it was very noisy.

The Receptionist very kindly upgraded us to another room which was very kind but it had three very small and very high windows that you could not look out of.

When I did manage to get someone he barely put a drink in my glass !!! we have been to Dubai on numerous occasions and their brunch is far better, rated; Dubai 10/10-- Singapore at the Fullerton 4/10.
Sunday evening the main bar in the hotel was closed and the rooftop bar is open till 11.00pm, what a way to treat resident customers, also on Monday evening the side door to the hotel was locked, access with room card, er NO, appalling paying so much money for a very poor service.",Brian,Group,Postmaster Room,5,"8, 2019",Guernsey,gg,[List]

Disappointed,4,The bed was comfy and the bathroom was amazing. The space was good for a couple and a baby. Baby had a good night's sleep and we were also well rested.,"The service was bad. 
Had to wait almost an hour for the baby cot and bathtub which I already requested in the booking beforehand and it was confirmed by their staff via booking.com chat. The plate and knife i requested also took super long to come as well.
Check-out was the worst experience. The manager had to tell the counter staff to open more counters when I was in the queue to check out at 12pm (normal check -out time) and the staff hurriedly went behind the counters and wore their blazers. Then the manager proceeded to ask me if I was checking out. After I answered ""yes"", he took the key cards and dropped them into the express check-out box and went to the counters to instruct his staff. I did not even finish talking. He did not even ask if there was anything else I need or just say ""thank you for staying with us"". My husband had to go over to him to tell him that we were not done talking. Then the manager apologised and asked what else did we need. I really did not expect this level of service from a reputable hotel chain. 
I also don't understand why the doormen had to ask if we needed help when they saw that we were lugging a lot of stuff with a baby. They should be asking if they could help because it is already obvious that we needed help?",Abigail,Family,Premier Courtyard Room,1,"27, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]

One day I went out and turned on the make up room sign, when I returned a few hours later the light was turned off suggesting room was cleaned but bed seemed not fully made then I realised that bathroom hadn’t been cleaned with a cleaning cloth left behind and towels not changed etc. I had to request housekeeping to complete the tidy up.",K,Solo traveler,Straits Club Marina Bay View Room,3,"24, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]

Arrived in the room and found only 2 x 500ml water and was perched by night. The pillows were too soft and woke up with an aching neck.

We got a room with a window that’s not soundproofed/sealed and we could hear fountains, people chattering by swimming pool and get woken up occasionally by the clock tower in the night.

Staycation with no view,4,Heritage building,"A room with high wall at balcony, different from booking.com photo. Felt cheated. But totally surprised with a spacious room with huge door to the balcony but facing a total high wall ( worst than a prison as even prison has a small window looking out) 
Staff at courtyards for high tea cannot even manage a inconsiderate customer who kept talking loudly over his laptop social media call. Totally untrained staff who’s at their wits end. 
Car park is so far away that we have to drag our luggage for a great distance. If we know, we will stop at main entrance and do a valets. And there is NO initiatives from check-in counter staff to offer car park complimentary coupon during check-in. Never expect a FULLERTON do NOT have parking facilities and have to use “other’s” car park. Deducted $20 when exiting car park. Despite feedback to duty manager, was told only entitled ONE complimentary parking once a day. Ridiculous. 
Housekeeping seem NOT to know need to have coffee capsules refilled each day and bathroom need floor mat. Even when called housekeeping for the coffee capsules, it took time to arrive.

Could be better,6,Building looks beautiful and it’s located in a nice area accessible to many other places of interest.,"I booked a 3D2N stay with Fullerton many months ago. As it is my wedding weekend, I checked if we could ask for an early check-in (just an hour earlier at 2pm) few weeks before the stay. I was told that I have to call in on the day itself to check for the possibility (even though I already told Fullerton it’s my wedding and I may not have the time to do that). A request was put in for me nonetheless. Nearer to date, my sister who also put in a request got a call inviting her to check in as early as 9am (but not me). As it is the COVID period, I definitely wouldn’t be able to leave my stuff in her room as there were restrictions and rules that we have to abide by. So I thought to try my luck again because I wouldn’t have time to call in the morning. When I called, before I could finish what I am requesting for, the staff couldn’t wait to give me a template answer which was to call in from 8-9am for the request. That was when I asked her on the reason for the differential service for their guests. With that, she immediately said that she will transfer my call to the front desk and I was then told I could check in early. 
The check-in process took quite a while too, and staff wasn’t meticulous. Staff told me that he would be passing me the declaration form so that my husband could be registered. But that didn’t happen. He also told us that extra bed (which we paid for) has already been arranged for my parents’ room but it wasn’t there when we got into the room. We had to give 2 calls to ask for the arrangement before it was finally sorted. 
Overall, the stay was fine. But we should have managed our expectations as we thought the service would be top-notch given the reputation of the Hotel. It definitely didn’t impress me like how many other Hotels (in Singapore) did.",Hexin,Couple,Quay Room,2,"10, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

It also very quiet and relaxed atmosphere in hotel, compared to Marina where hundreds of people moving around and constant ambient noise.","Restaurants closing quite early all around, so after arriving from zoo around 12 midnight there was none open, but that is not an issue - it took dining very fast and have long menu which available round the clock.",Ilya,Group,Heritage Room,1,"17, 2020",Russia,ru,[List]

Throughout our stay, we were snugly looked after by all of the hotel staff. We would like to personally thank the Fullerton's Duty Manager during our stay, Justin. He definitely put our comfort and satisfaction as a top priority. His professionalism and hospitality made our stay at the Fullerton a truly memorable experience. 
One of the highlights of our stay is the iconic view of the Singapore skyline from our room, mainly made possible by the Fullerton's impeccable location.
