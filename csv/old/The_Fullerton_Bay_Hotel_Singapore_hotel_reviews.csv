High Tea,CJ02,"Came here to celebrate birthdays and we were not disappointed! Wonderful, artisan desserts and perfectly portioned servings.   Lotha and Wayne did an exceptional job in making our visit pleasant by being attentive to our requests, thank you. Also, thank you for making it special by playing the birthday song on the piano and the slices of cakes. we had a great time here at The Landing Point at Fullerton Bay hotel.",5
Very high quality hotel,Shentos,"Stunning hotel, backed up by outstanding service. The construction and interior design of the Fullerton Bay make it a unique place to stay. The marina location is as central as it gets and the view across the water to MBS is a great one. We stayed in a third floor corner room, which was high spec and with views of the water on two sides. The rooftop pool is a special area for spending time in central Singapore. The Lantern bar is a great vantage point for evening drinks and watching the light show. The hotel feels more relaxed and less touristy than MBS (which works at MBS, not a slight on that experience- certainly also worth checking out). We stayed with our twenty two month old daughter for two nights. Service was exceptionally good and welcoming, though perhaps the vibe is better suited to families at Shangri-La. Two nights at the end of our trip were memorable and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Alvin the butler and Indra on reception were particularly helpful, nothing was too much trouble- very welcome when travelling with a toddler and much appreciated. All their colleagues were also very kind. Perhaps best recommended for couples who want a more chilled, but high-end, boutique experience. Five star review an easy decision.…",5
The Best Hotel in Singapore,bombstoliv,"Everything about my experience at The Fullerton was incredible. The upgraded room with the bay view was so amazing, the decor and ambience of the hotel was just lovely, the staff was incredible and welcoming and the location couldn’t be beat. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.",5
Worst bar in Singapore or anywhere to be honest,renaefranklin2908,"I don’t think I have been to a more pretentious entitled place in my life , from the 20 somethings pushing past us to get into the lift to the duff duff music on entry.Please wait to be given a standing only spot at 10.30 pm and then take 25 mins to get an overpriced cocktail. Get a table then wait 30 mins to get a second drink which actually never came  , how long does it take to pour a beer? The only reason that it get 1 star is due to the view and the air conditioned toilets very disappointing experience would not recommend at all .",1
Birthday cake,Manami,I went to Lantern restaurant by The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore for birthday! The waiter whose name is Julius served birthday plate with singing. We appreciated it so much! My friend was so glad! Thank you so much .,5
Outstanding service by great staff,Richard M,"Our two day stay was made all the more pleasurable by the friendly and attentive staff at the bars, restaurants and hotel reception. We like the location where it is easy to get to the underground and easy walks to/from some of the major sights of Singapore. This is a great hotel and we will be returning!",5
"Amazing staff, beautiful hotel and a personalized experience",Thyago P,"The beautiful and luxurious entrance hall and restaurant is complemented by an amazing staff, beautiful room (i recommend end the premier bay on 1st floor). From breakfast, Tea and dinner the food was delicious. I was provided with more then confort, perks and amenities, it was an personal and intimate experience.",5
Lantern Bar fantastic on two days,Peter J,"We had a superb evening in the Lantern bar.  Greeted by Alvin in the lobby and personally taken up before the bar was even open, it seemed nothing was too much trouble.  The staff went to the effort of bringing up cake from downstairs to go with our tea - even though it was not normally served.  Germa then managed to find a table for us the next evening to watch the light show.  We were greeted like old friends firstly by Alvin, then Germa and Anna when we were again escorted up to the Lantern.  We enjoyed a marvellous meal and were looked after for the evening by Julius.  A perfect location on the bay, along with exemplary service.  Cannot praise this beautiful hotel highly enough.",5
Accommodating Staff at Lantern Bar,Ma angelica D,We enjoyed pur stay at the lantern bar. Julius Tallano who is one of the staff is very accommodating and polite. He even guided us in ordering one the best and unique drinks that i have ever tasted. We will surely recommend lantern bar as a place to visit,5

Nice service and great view,Junny Kim,"I got recommended by someone who works in SG. I asked I’d like to check out a bar with nice view of marina bay sands, Lantern bar is it! People are very nice, warm, and caring. Def nice night view, it would be lovely to come here with your beloved ones. It is not that loud so it is also enjoyable with family.",5
Great service for my partner’s birthday High Tea experience,Hong Jun,"We were served under Anthony and his service was great. Had a birthday cake and he made a complimentary drink for her as well. It was fantastic. Also, we needed to charge our phones cause our portable died and it was tended too. Really a life saver. We also had a complimentary parking since we drove",5
High Tea,Naziera Jastina,"The service rendered by Lotha, Asel and Hui Xia were excellent! Very attentive and accommodating to guests’ needs. They were very welcoming and great at their work as well, explaining the menu to us. Thanks!",5
Afternoon tea at the Landing Point,Ming L,"I had afternoon tea with my family here to celebrate my birthday. The savory dishes were my favorite, especially the duck rillettes and smoked salmon! The variety of teas and coffees we're also very impressive and delicious. Fairus and Lotha were very helpful and accommodating.",5
Disappointing and not up to standard,Andrew B,Always used to look forward to and enjoy my stays at the Fullerton Bay Hotel.  Despite the perfect location for Singapore the Fullerton team are not providing 5 star service.  Teamwork looks poor across the various teams be that the kitchen and front office service teams are not working together.  Service is slow and disjointed.  Teams are trying but it looks like there is a gap in senior management oversight.  After years of being a massive fan of the Fullerton Bay I will not be staying there again and will not be recommending it to friends and family.  Simply put the gap between the price you pay and the service you get are too far apart.,1
Great Service and Food,ay,Great service and warm hospitality from Ms Lotha.  Thank you Ms Lotha for making the dining experience warm and pleasant to enjoy. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family! The place to go for a chill and relaxing afternoon,5
Afternoon tea at The Landing Point,Soh L,"I had a great afternoon tea experience at The Landing Point at The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore. Special thanks to Karen, Anthony and Lotha for the good service. The Chinese lady who served us coffee was so warm and nice too. Thank you!",5
Excellent afternoon high tea experience,tang63,"Went to The Landing Point within Fullerton Bay Hotel for the afternoon high tea set. Food and service was excellent, with a great view of Marina bay sands and the waterfront. Special call out to Anthony and Lotha from the service staff, who remembered the little details and even celebrated my friend’s birthday. Will definitely come back again.",5
Disappointing afternoon Tea.,Marioviaggiatore,"Afternoon tea at The Landing Point. What a low quality experience !!! Even without considering the exorbitant cost of the afternoon tea, the experience is not at all nice and quite below expectations.  Service was poor.  Food nice at appearance but  not so interesting at taste.  Very disappointing.",2
the place we would say YES,PAULSMITH,we arrive late in the night and we didn't expect that they still keep the room as we need all the night Manager was very sweet person and had the smart eyes  we felt overwhelm with the nice staff   then the best thing is the lady in the front they are beauty also,5
Lovely way to enjoy Marina Bay,A_S_Ongko,"We had the vegetarian afternoon tea, and Lotha made the experience extra special with attentive service from start to finish. Grateful to the team too for assigning us a table with a wonderful view of the Marina Bay.  The set is generally good, though there could be more variety to the savoury vegetarian items. Still, kudos for offering allium-free options!",5
High Tea with Friends,maiers27,I celebrated my 41st Birthday at The Landing Point Fullerton. We had fun in this place and we enjoyed taking pictures too! The staff are accomodating and making sure that we have everything we need! Special thanks to Lotha and Fairus!,5
Great Staycation,Daria B,"You should be very proud of your staff who were friendly and very accommodating. Especially big thank you to Indra!!! The room was lovely. We loved the extremely comfortable bed, the atmosphere, the attention to details and the hotel products, snacks and drinks. The restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and the food very good. It was our second stay at your hotel but it wont be the last. We had a wonderful time and felt very comfortable and welcomed at your hotel. Thank you!",5
Afternoon tea at The Landing Point,Khrizelle P,We had afternoon tea at The Landing Point. It’s full house but thanks to Lotha she’s very accommodating and sweet. Love the Sakura and Royal Orchid tea it really compliments the desserts. We had a nice view of the Marina Bay Sands. We will definitely go back.,5
Birthday tea at the Landing Point,Siew Choo L,"Ambience was gorgeous & the tea spread was absolutely divine! Each item was exquisitely beautiful and delicious. Service was impeccable and we loved the gracious attention of Lotha and Asel. I fedback at end of tea that it was a beautiful birthday celebration and the next thing we knew, they sent a beautiful and complimentary  slice of chocolate cake with a candle. So thoughtful! I loved the whole experience and would certainly go again.",5
Great ambience and services,XJH-DT,"Very home warming fell and great services from the  staff. Went for the hi tea, they change a new menu display the best menu and matching with a great choice of tea or coffee. The service by the team is great and always timely and patience. Great introduction and recommends of the hitea item and what drinks is matching .",5
Excellent!,cupcakesfloral,Visited The Landing Point with a friend on 26 Jul 2022. Lotha & Karen were very helpful and attentive. Food was yummy as well! Definitely will return again. Thanks for the excellent service and food! :),5
Great gem of a property right on the bay,asiagirl511,"This property, its staff, service, rooms and facilities are all top notch.  The rooms are spacious and luxurious with large bathrooms that include tubs and showers. The bed is ultra luxe and comfortable. Rooms even have a private balcony.  The breakfast buffet in the morning and the hot entrees are amazing. Service in the breakfast restaurant is also amazing - JJ deserves extra kudos!!  The gym and pool area are on the rooftop and very clean, modern and well maintained. Lobby bar is a great feature for meetings and casual dining.  I simply loved my entire stay!!",5
Will stay again without a doubt,schester,"This hotel is now my new go to hotel when in Singapore.  Worth every $$$.  Check-in process was smooth and staff were friendly and approachable.  Room was amazing and had a great view, was unexpectedly large and had everything we wanted.  Location was perfect and it was only a short walk to most places we wanted to visit.  Breakfast was perfect and meals were freshly made if required.  Again - all staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble for them.  Room was comfortable, bathroom was huge and absolutely no problems at all with our stay.  Will definitely be staying again",5
Best hotel in Singapore,Stephanie G,"This is our favorite hotel in Singapore. We go often and we have had a chance to try several of the top hotels. This is by far the best one. The location is slightly off so you always need a car. But if you are staying here, you probably have a car waiting for you anyway. We love the rooms and the rooftop pool. The food at the cafe for breakfast is delicious too. We highly recommend Fullerton Bay and please do not confuse it with Fullerton Hotel, which is the post office hotel. Fullerton Bay is much nicer.",5
Expressions Afternoon Tea,Bernard L,"Experienced the newly launched “Expressions Afternoon Tea” today. Distinctive new menu of pastries and savoury items. Facing Marina Bay, we had an enjoyable afternoon as we while the time away with the good food and drinks. Recommended.",5
Incredible hotel,Angelesevela,"We stay four nights It,s a beautiful place  The ubication is the best and I recommended the room with bay views You can see Marina bay and at night is espectacular  The breakfast has big quality The staff are also very kind and efficient and they help you about the city etc  Perhaps the cleaning service are not so good The wifi is good The rooms are big with a very good toilet I think it is a very good option for stay in Singapore",5
Perfect,AnAnthropologist,"This hotel was by far the best part of our week long trip to Singapore. It is a great location within walking distance to lots of restaurants and with a great view of the harbor. The roof top infinity pool is terrific and we appreciated the unlimited Spring water. The breakfast was amazing- it was made to order with great choices of delicious western and Asian food. Our deluxe room was very comfortable. The complimentary tour of the historic sister property the Fullerton- which was originally a post office- was very interesting for the architecture as well as the history.  However, the best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We were especially grateful that the hotel arranged for someone to come to our room to perform the Covid tests that were…",5
Amazing Singapore experience,Sandspoco,"The Fullerton Bay Hotel occupies the premium position on Marina Bay.  We had a room with point-blank views of the iconic buildings on the waterfront.  The room, as all the rooms, are large and clean; and the hotel staff, whether front-of-room, cleaning and dining are all friendly, efficient and professional.  The only thing I can think to improve it, is to add USB connections for charging.",5
Leisure stay,lws701,"Good service and friendly staff who are very attentive, good room view and very clean, good environment for a nice relaxing holiday and very conducive to do work, good location as it is very near a lot of food places and iconic sights",5
Fabulous views!,peterwC6350RJ,Stayed at the beautiful Robinson Suite. The views were fantastic. Olivia Hee is a great Butler and went out of her way to make us have a wonderful stay. She definitely elevated our experience at the Fullerton Bay. ,5
"Extremely comfortable room, unmatched views",robbiegoh,"Of the several excellent hotels in the Marina Bay area, this is the only one that is literally on the waterfront (and also low-rise), so that you really have the feel of being on the bay.  We had a theme suite on the top (6th) floor, which was a very spacious and well-appointed room, but (because it was a big corner room) also had a 270-degree view of the whole of the Bay, some of the financial district buildings, etc.  Service was good and responsive.",5
The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore,Biztraveller2022too,First class modern hotel with sweeping views of the bay. Great service. Rooms serviced several times a day. Great rooftop pool and bar. Breakfast ok but not as good as the rest of the hotel. Get an exclusive of breakfast rate if you can. Not the cheapest but you get what you pay for. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend.,5
Exceptional,dpodger34,"Just Book it and walk in the door and you will understand why!!! Cant fault this place, the staff, the location, the cleanliness. The room sizes are very spacious with everything you can ask for. The pool is magnificent and has a great view.",5
Excellent hotel with fantastic views and amenties,1989Kai,Excellent hotel with fantastic views and facilities. Staff were pleasant and helpful - they went out of the way to help us with every request. This was the best staycation we ever had. Amazing experience! ,5
Best trip to Singapore May 2022,yvalani,"5 stars  all over, location, service, food and accommodations. Unforgettable family trip. Although flights were long and luggage missed the connecting flight and arrived 2 days later, it was worth it. Enjoyed some Michelin star restaurants plus the nightly light shows at the Marina. Changi airport is very clean and efficient. VAT refunds were efficient. There are no priority ques for business class travelers but there was no need. The facial recognition check in was very fast. Security check is prior to boarding the flight so one must allow sufficient time to board. Singapore should be on everyone's bucket list or must visit list. Caters to all ages and tastes. ",5
bay view room,miszi,"Beautiful comfy room bay view. Thanks to ndp rehearsal, we witness aircraft rehearsal outside our balcony, and thanks to i-light event, beautiful night lights all over mbs. Beautiful night view…………….. ",4
Excellent,nenickh13,"It's a good hotel, the staff friendly, the food was good, room so clean, they give a new toiletries everyday, the rooftop and the pool so beautiful. maybe you can provide more variety of breakfast in the future",5
"Clean and comfortable, good location for business and quick shoppings",239hanatokyo,"I reserved the hotel for a business trip as it was recommended from my colleagues. Clean and modern hotel, with good view of the Marina Bay Sands. Also walking distance (when cool) to the Marina Bay Sands shopping center and very close to Lau Pa Sat, where you can casually join local food. Would recommend for anyone wishing to enjoy some time aside from business in the financial district across. ",5
Wedding venue and stay overnight,ValMelWedding,"Wonderful experience, we got hitched at the Fullerton pods then stayed overnight at the corner room. Beautiful top to bottom with an extremely helpful staff there every step of the way, for our special day.",5
Service excels.,StevoDevo45,"The point of difference with this hotel for me was the level of effort the staff go to for their guests when required. We had some bad luck on arrival, after which the staff and management made sure the rest of our stay went swimmingly. The rooms are good, service excellent, and food tasty. Thank you!",5
Wonderful stay at Fullerton Bay Hotel,Scenic35671298033,Check in was a breeze and we were greeted to a beautiful room with unobstructed views of Marina Bay. It was a sight to behold. Really enjoyed sipping tea by the balcony and admiring the city both in the day and night. The service at the hotel was also fantastic with great attention to detail. The room was luxurious and I would definitely return again in future. Special thanks to the team at Fullerton Bay Hotel for making the stay such a pleasant and enjoyable one! ,5
Family staycation,idyllicty,"Came here for a family staycation. Service was good, as expected from a 5 star hotel. They had good kids amenities for children below 7.   However, the room is quite underwhelming considering the price paid. Bathtub drainage was spoiled which was a huge bummer for us. ",3
Beautiful relaxing hotel with great service,610DebbieG,"We recently spent 3 nights at the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore.  The hotel is located in a beautiful location overlooking Singapore Harbour - would definately recommend spending the extra for the Bay View Rooms.  This really is a 5 star resort.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and a special mention to Oliver from Room Service who seemed to always be there for us, he was extremely attentive and pleasant and made our trip very special.  Would highly recommend this hotel either for a short or long stay.  Also, the pool area I think is better than the pool at Marina Bay Sands resort, it is private and intimate and the pool service is exceptional.",5
Lack of staff is very apparent,Luxurylover_80,"This is an amazing hotel and l have loved it from previous stays however it’s pretty clear FBH does not have the staff it needs to service it’s guests.   I stayed to enjoy the pool for my last day of a trip and there were literally zero staff around. Guests towels, cups, rubbish was not cleaned all day and just sat there. Birds had the opportunity to enjoy the left overs.   Also no one to greet you when you arrive or assist with luggage etc.  I had come from mandarin oriental which didn’t appear to suffer the same staff shortages.   The hotel is still beautiful and has lovely facilities I just hope they sort out the staffing issues soon.",2
Fantastic Fullerton Bay,toniice79,"The Fullerton Bay is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at ever. The quality overall is fantastic, the location is great and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I will be coming back and staying here every time I’m in Singapore ",5
Wonderful service from FBH,LC,"Vanessa at the front desk deserved many thumbs up. From the time of check-in, we were impressed with her service. When asked for the view from our premier room, she was able to advise us that there was a higher category of room available, at a good price upgrade. We immediately grabbed the offer. No regrets! She also gave us a complimentary late checkout. Everyone must really try the bayview room, the full view of mbs when you wake up is really gorgeous. We were thankful for the stay as we enjoyed ourselves throughout the stay. Special thanks to Alvin the head butler for extending the free ice cream for my child but we didn't manage to go back the next day to redeem.   2 years ago and 2 years from now, the room condition still looks really good though the bathtub knobs for the…",5
Full week business stay,jlK9974UK,"One of my favourite hotels in the city. High standards and extremely well located. Helpful and professional staff. Impeccable rooms. Great facilities, including several restaurants where I can have business guests. ",5
A wonderful part of our Honeymoon,hoathenfold,"The Fullerton Bay Hotel is an absolutely lovely property and doesn't hold its #1 position on TripAdvisor by luck.  A very warm welcome when we first arrived and continual touches of brilliance throughout or 6 night stay.  If you are reading this review then be confident that as per all of the other great reviews, this is an extremely nice place to stay.  We were hugely impressed by the Concierge and especially Andrew Yip who was a constant source of information, assistance and recommendations.  Andrew's guidance  for our first ever visit to Singapore was invaluable and we can't thank him enough.  He must have been glad to see the back of me after the amount of things I asked him, but everything was dealt with quickly, efficiently and with a smile.  He also seems to work 24/7 as…",5
Excellent facility and location.,Enpeejay,"We stayed here between May 29 and June 10. Had a great experience with very caring and responsive staff. Would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others. Fantastic location from our perspective. Some issues with access to Concierge but when we finally connected, all was fine!",5
My experience,Jatzini Monroy,"hello, I will tell you about my experience, the hotel has many amenities such as the possibility of breakfast, lunch and dinner, without a little expensive but it is delicious, eating at the hotel makes the experience much easier, I loved its positioning, since it is central, the workers are very friendly and you can go out to see new places since they are close to the hotel, if you go and need internet, the hotel has Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, its rooms are super large, comfortable and very clean, without thinking it is a wonderful place and highly recommended...",5
Great experience,Jeff G,"A beautiful hotel in a great location by the lake with a great view of Marina Sand Hotel and with a wonderful rooftop bar, The Latern. The Fuller Bay Hotel is a great high quality hotel and rooms and a wonderful and serviceminded staff . Just a great week in Singapore at Fullerton Bay Hotel. ",5
Everything is good except the very old swimming pool. and mold in the bathroom,hadcha,"Great location Recommend to stay in the bay view room to see the symbol of Singapore. But I want to improve a lot of things like TV remote, old dvd player and need to clean the bathroom more. I found a lot of mold in the shower area. And the swimming pool in the hotel is old and inefficient. Other than that, I also encountered a problem with the key card. I can't enter my room. The hotel has too few staff.",4
Perfect stay for family,jeremykeck,Decided to book a trip for my family and it was so pleasant that we are missing it now.   The staff are friendly and the food is so nice.   Facilities are new and overall it is a good place for family and friends ,5
Great service and amazing view,skinnyswiss,"Conveniently located allowing walk by foot to the Marina Bay area as well as to the Raffles Place area which means you can shop, dine and also do your business meetings if those happen in the Raffles business district. Also great running course towards the back of MBS where there is a park with paved roads. In terms of the hotel, you will get great service, good food, a decent gym and a great outdoor pool on the rooftop where you can do laps.",5
Stay in Singapore for Business,Patrick091064,Very comfortable hotel. In addition the location of the hotel is very well. I recommend this hotel for a stay in Singapore whatever the reason of this stay. In addition the staff is very professional.   ,4

Absolutely the best!,marko1974,"Stayed 2 nights, wish we could stay longer. Absolutely amazing property- had the marina bay view room. Immaculately clean- awesome view of marina bay sands and light show at night. Staff are super friendly. Buffet breakfast reasonable priced- good variety. Highly recommend. One of the best hotels we have stayed in.",5
Mr & Mrs Chua,Lynn Zeng,"Dear Fullerton Bay,  We would like to express my thanks and appreciation for the service and care we received at your hotel from 24th May to 26th May 2022.  I was there for 2 nights with my wife and for all these days we were attended with utmost warmth. We were impressed to see the prompt room service despite the peak season.  To front desk manager Indra, who has been nothing short of phenomenal. He is warm, friendly & professional. The genuine smile on his face when we received the two couple bears revealed his true interest in wanting us to be happy!  We would like to express our most sincere thanks once again to Indra for making our wedding anniversary such a memorable one.   Indra, continue to shine and to be Fullerton Bay’s walking ambassador.  See you again in July! :) …",5

The managers and staff were so warmth and provided us excellent services. The bay view room design are modern and beautiful, at level 1 the balcony was spacious facing MBS. The morning breakfast in La Brasserie is amazing and delicious. We love the room and food! Sincerely we wish to thanks Sharon for assisting our room arrangement and co-ordination for FBH and FH. We enjoyed so much! Also Kelly excellent service to prepare our room arrangement, accompanied us to the room and co-ordinated the room birthday decor for my wife.

Nice stay With a few suggestions for improvement,schumachertim,Wonderful Hotel in a perfect spot. The price / performance ration was not fully appropriate. The rooms and the maid service were perfect. The Rooftop view with the pool are awesome. The breakfast could have more selection. ,4
"A short, but fantastic stay",Renato Jean G,"Me and my fiance were there for one night but we enjoyed our stay here; the front desk staff were helpful with my enquiries, the room was clean and immaculate on arrival and the breakfast was fantastic with the a la carte and buffet options. Next time I return to Singapore, we will stay here longer! ",5
Service & Room Review,nuraslinda95,"The Anderson suite was fantastic. From the cleanliness and serviceability of the room to the panoramic view.   The jacuzzi room was beyond imagination. Once in a lifetime experience. Though we felt that the toilet was a downgrade from the suite. Automatic toilet bowls, bidet, dual sinks could be added.  All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we would definitely be back!",5
Back again,SwedenSkifan,"Back again at this fantastic hotel. We were able to check in fairly early which was appreciated, beautiful rooms and bathrooms and a nice balcony to enjoy. The beds are comfortable with nice bedding. The service is mostly very good, but during breakfast it was at times not so good, things were forgotten, wrong meals delivered and having to wait for a long time to be served. What really disappointed us was that there was no restaurant service by the pool, The Lantern did not open until 5 PM, this was not OK, meaning no drinks or food beeing served until late afternoon. Hope the opening hours will change eventually. At night a great place to be serving drinks with a smile Had a nice afternoon tea our last day. Will absolutely be back",5
Very good experience; but needs some improvements to be at the top,TravelingDuo2130,"The experience overall was very good. The location is pretty much perfect, also the service in general is excellent, so is the wow effect when you arrive. So why not a five then? First, having stayed in manny similar hotels elsewhere in Asia, I was surprised by the narrow options for breakfast (which is usually one key feature of many high end hotels in the region), maybe it is was due to Covid restrictions, but I was quite surprised to see that there were only a few a la carte options, rather than the usual massive spread of different buffet and a la carte alternatives. My second negative comment is regarding the fitness facilities. The gym is basically two treadmills and a few weights cramped on a 30m2 space…if there more than two people at the same time you are bumping into…",4
2 star service at 5 star prices,foodfiendAustralia,"On my first visit to Singapore in 3 years, I was extremely disappointed in the Fullerton Bay. On Arrival my wife was shown to our room...to discover another guest had already been checked into it. Not an issue, mistakes happen, until the front desk clerk tried to insist she take the room once luggage had been removed.."" The room was cleaned, it is fine"" ...as in cleaned before someone else put their luggage in it and had access. Other than that, the hotel was not really fully open. The rooftop restaurant was closed until 5 pm, and other outlets were usually full, or in the case of The Brasserie, horrible. Again, staff was overall unhelpful and aloof.",2
"Good drinks, food and great view of MBS",MH,"Celebrated mother's day here! Not too crowded which was good. Food and drinks were good! If you want a quiet night in, this is the place! Loges was also very attentive and helpful. Cheers mate and thank you for the flower for my mum!",5

Beautiful hotel,AndrewFold,Stayed here for New Year's Eve and the 3 following days. The hotel is just stunning! the palatial dining area for the special New Year's Eve dinner was amazing. the hotel has restored some of the old dockside buildings and connected them up with ultra modern building. The room was beautifully laid out as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. The pool was quite stunning too! Staff were very hospitable and welcoming.,5
Good but could be perfect,carolchiang888,"Good location. Nice hotel. If there could be more variety of food, it would be ideal (consider to include Japanese food?)  Overall, it is a nice hotel with good bay view. A relaxed fantastic stay. I would recommend this hotel. ",4
Wedding weekend,Jaemielim92,"We hosted our wedding at The Clifford Pier and everything was amazing.

"Location, Location, Location",JT from MA,"I love everything about this hotel.  The airport transport arrangement, the room, the food, the staff, and did I mention the location.  My room overlooked Marina Bay, and it was a marvelous sight to see at night, as the Sands lit up the bay.  The staff was attentive to my every whim and need.  The food was outstanding.  Can't be beat.  Perhaps my favorite hotel in Singapore.  You won't be disappointed.",5
good hotel but not comparable to top tier hotels,V1835WVguest,"overall it was not so bad, but I feel my package price was bit over price and not all contents for kid was available during my stay. But, if you really go, please check with Farm tour to find Joe who was excellent guide for my family! ",3
Best hotel in Singapore!!!,SisselaN,"From my experience the best hotel in Singapore!! Great service from the concierge, especially Syahir in the concierge and Andrew in reception -5 starts to them! They really gave the little extra! However all staff were very helpful and nice. Breakfast was gorgeous, good variety to choose from, great staff (again!) gorgeous atmosphere (the whole hotel), very clean and spotless! Spacious rooms with great layout. We also enjoyed the rooftop bar with great view of the city and marina bay sands. We enjoyed every part of it! We are very picky travellers but Fullerton Bay hit all the boxes and will be our choice again when we are back in Singapore!  Thank you for making our trip so great!",5
Marvellous 6 star experience,Daniel,"Had a one night staycation over the Easter weekend with a couple of friends in a bay view room. We would like to thank Kelly, Andrew, Alvin for their warm hospitality and various prompt follow ups whenever we had any requests. Oliver also also offered to help us store our drinks in the hotel fridge when we mentioned the in room fridge was not cold.  We had a good time and experience at the pool as well as Lantern bar for drinks in the evening. We were well served by Zool, Loges and Daniel who ensured our birthday celebration was tip top. They consistently checked in on us to ensure we have everything we need despite our table being located in the far corner of the bar.  Breakfast in the morning was also a very grand affair. We were well taken care of by the team at La Brasserie…",5
Faultless Stay,aab1976,This hotel is 6 star in my opinion & has a fabulous view of Marina Bay Sands which in my opinion is much better than staying there! The staff here like Kelly Yugen and Amsyar made it an incredible stay. I will be back!,5

Million dollar view,Dzr1208,It’s definitely one of the best and most memorable stay in Singapore. The view from Bay View Room was fantastic - bathtub cannot be better designed this way as the whole Marina Bay seems so peaceful. The little balcony also made a difference as many other hotels of the area doesn’t have this part. I actually feel like I’m on a luxury cruise!,5
Managing Director,Geir,"Great service, perfect rooms and the people working at the hotel are very professional, kind and service minded (special thanks to Kelly)). Fullerton and Singapore is the perfect combination, hope to come back soon.",5
They could have done better with warmer front desk!,Pinky Tobiano,"What a beautiful hotel but when I checked in, the front desk was rude and inattentive. She truly ruined the experience. I tried to be polite but I guess she had a bad day and took it out on the client. I believe that customer experience is very vital to all guests. It was truly a disappointment considering I was so excited to stay there . It was my very first time",1

Best staycation ,RT,"One of the best hotels we have stayed. Good services, attentive and friendly across all services, front desk, f & b, house keeping... Above all is, Ms. Kelly Shum, due to miscommunication, but Ms. Kelly went all out to make good of everything without us been delay or any discomfort. All the best to her. Meals at Jade and The Landing Point were fantastic. Good foods and services, the best. Older service s gentleman at Jade who served tbl 28 and Ms. Lotha of the Landing Point. Well done. But just a little bit of impatient from a serving staff during breakfast this morning, 10th April. A big thank you for the wonderful stay and services. Especially to Ms. Kelly Shum. ",5
Great Service for food and drinks,elizabethhmhm,We had a wonderful Friday evening out here! A great view of the Marina area with a fun music playlist.  The Service was outstanding - nothing was too much trouble (especially considering we had complicated dietary needs on our table). Thanks to Loges who served us for most of the evening. We felt very well looked after. To top it off the food was very good quality indeed!   We haven't been back to the Fullerton Bay for a few years but we were pleased to see the service and food quality has improved considerably since our last visit! Get some live music going on on Friday and Saturday and this would be the perfect venue!   Book in advance if you want to guarantee a table in a good spot for the view.,5
Breathtaking,anda_melbs,"Our first trip out of Australia after 2 years of long lockdowns and omg this was amazing !!   We spent 3 nights at FBH and were very impressed with the service, everyone is very lovely and helpful. The rooms are beautiful with a balcony to enjoy your coffee ☕️.  Food was great in all of the restaurants.   Spectacular views from the lantern and the brassiere.   The pool is amazing!! When we visited , there weren’t many people so we could enjoy it to ourselves.   Would absolutely come back !! ",5

Staff was excellent especially Zool who attended to us and had great knowledge of all the teas served. A truly beautiful experience to dine there overlooking the bay.,5
Long check-in and Hotel categorises guests according to room types,passenger67335382022,"Poor customer service from the front desk. The manager Kelly Shum clearly categorises the hotel guests according to the room type. Do not waste your money staying in the Fullerton Bay but rather we recommend the Fullerton Hotel which the staffs there are friendlier and more welcoming. Check-in paperwork took at least 20minutes but to only inform that the room would not be ready anytime soon. The manager used condescending tone to inform that the guests that received their keys before us were staying in different room types despite arriving later than us. From the time we reached to check-in at the front desk to collect the keys, it took 50 minutes. ",1
Easter Weekend stay 2022,Pang Pang,"Welcome reception was pleasant and friendly by Manager Kelly Shum & comfy experience during the stay. Room was clean & neat with ample amenities. Bayview room had the nicest view of Marina bay sands with calm waters. Surprises with bears, balloons & macarons makes me happy during the Easter weekend stay. Breakfast spread was excellent with many choices. An extended check out at 6pm was much relaxing and worth it. Departure was interesting with Kelly sharing experiences with us.",5

Relaxing staycation in The Fullerton Bay Hotel,Cruiser188229,"Booked the Deluxe King room for one night for a staycation. After checking in and staying for a night, decided to extend our stay with the corner bayview room as I've heard many people raved about this room. It was not a disappointment! EXCELLENT VIEW! Hotel deserves its recognition by forbes as 1 of the only 3 hotels in Singapore to obtain the 5 stars :) ",5
Amazing stay!,Natalia H,"For my husbands Birthday we decided to stay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel and it was a very right decision. The employees of the hotel helped me to organise a welcome Birthday surprise for my husband in a very efficient manner. The hotel staff did everything during our stay to make it memorable.  The corner room is just a must to book. The views at the Marina Bay are impressive. The room was super comfortable and they have a great attention to details. The service is great as well. I will be back to try their afternoon tea soon.:-) Very much recommend this beautiful, amazing hotel. Believe me, its worth it. ;-) ",5
Wonderful stay,Sara S,"The room was wonderful with a great, tranquil view of the bay. Staff was really hospitable - they surprised us with a slice of cake for my husband's birthday, though we hadn't mentioned it to them. We enjoyed the rooftop pool as well. ",5
Nice view from the Jacuzzi but that's all,sailaway75,"This hotel promises more than it delivers. We had heard such good things about the hotel but our staff proved to be a disappointment.  First, the good.   Syakir from the concierge desk was really welcoming and friendly. He greeted us the moment we stepped foot into the hotel and escorted us to reception. While waiting for a receptionist to be ready, he explained the facilities of the hotel and suggested some places for meals in the hotel and around the area.  If you are here for the view from the rooftop pool, be aware that there is only a view of the Lantern bar and of the OUE office tower from the main pool. You need to go to one of the two jacuzzis at the side for a really nice view of Marina Bay. Also, note that at the main pool, the sun is blocked by the OUE office tower by…",2
Cheers to Daniel,Kelvin G,"I visited lantern with friends and my sister for my farewell dinner. Thank to Daniel for giving us a extraordinary service with a great smile.

Unforgettable birthday treat,Tan Regina,"The staffs were very professional and friendly, the rooms are clean and spacious. They have a smart voice, so you can connect your iPad or mobile phone to the tv using the QR code on screen. I did not get a room with the marina bay view, but the view from my room is still nice enough. Not sure if the guests from the restaurants opposite of my room were able to see into my room or not, so I had the day curtains closed most of the times. The room is very quiet and comfortable, the only time I can hear anything outside the room were when the neighboring guests closed their door loudly. Thank you Pearlyn, housekeeping team, in-room dining team and the staffs at La Brasserie.",4
Excellent experience,nhc888,"Great recent experience at Fullerton Bay. Service has not changed from pre Covid. Great staff who are friendly and helpful.

Although our room was not ready at 3 pm when we checked in, we were ushered to La Brassiere for drinks compliments from the hotel while waiting. Luckily the wait was only about 30 mins. Ordered macarons for my daughter and they served it, again with compliments!  Room was very comfortable and spacious to fit in a 3rd bed and still with plenty of space to move around. Loved the mirrors everywhere in the room! The view was fantastic!  Service from hotel was excellent. Breakfast was sumptuous and delicious. Breakfast for my daughter was again on the house, a very pleasant surprise for us. Upon checking out, for my daughter again, they blessed her with a cute mini Fullerton bear!  …",5

There were some confusion regarding my booking at first. I requested a change of dates for both of my reservations, and was informed that I would have to inform the third party (Traveloka) about the change. However, I did not inform them beforehand, and when I called FBH on the morning of our new check in dates, they informed me that my booking had remained in their original dates. I got a shock. I immediately explained my situation and they said that they would contact their Reservations Team to see if I could get a room on that day. I would like to give a shout out to Yugen, the Guest Relations Executive from FBH who patiently helped me throughout…",5

NEVER FAIL TO IMPRESS,KEITHLOH222,"This is my birthday Trip back to Fullerton Bay Hotel . The main reason why I always try to go back to Fullerton Bay Hotel is because they always treat me like a family and i feel home especially my Super Star Staff aka “Miss Olivia” .  Her sensitivity , care and hospitality has never fail to surprise me at all times and always had me thought about the hotel from time to time . It’s rare to come by with this experience for a hotel as she is genuine !! And with her current role and responsibility which needed more attention from her role however she has still exceeded every single needs and at times surprised me instead with her extra miles.

Fullerton bay hotel is xxxxx,eugene l,"Nobody to help with your things/luggage at drop off area . Bell hiding inside the lobby .  Room had a musty smell ( water marks on the ceiling) - although they did a room change  Room is dusty . Tv is dated .  Bath tub stopper damaged so the water can’t be drained after you have your soak.  and house keeping told me this is common in a few rooms.( so they don’t really give a Hoot on maintaining )  Food is over price …   $15 for four pieces of thin slices of satay and five cubes of rice which they masquerade as ketupat .  drinks price reasonably though .   Overall, this is not a $800 hotel … only the view is good.   More like your typical holiday inn. They make a mockery of their location and don’t do Justice to singapore hospitality scene.",1
Excellent stay in Singapore,Emile N,"Everything at the FBH was top notch.

We have been here back in 2018 and were back here again in 2022.  2.5/5  The reservation team needs improvement though, as they were in severe manpower shortage and experience, to prevent guests for having to wait 45minutes just to check in on a late Friday afternoon. The goverment could do more to help the hotels, with the employment of foreign talent (and as a hirer myself, we know alot of us, Singaporeans won't/ can't work long hours), here to out the rest of the crew.  5/5  Maria and ""Rindy"" from the Operator Team were most helpful.

Maybe it was missing the sweet surprise element like a small basket of fruits or a little box of chocolates that we saw in other hotels, or the fact that this was an anniversary stay booking but there was no effort from the hotel for a commemoration token. In any case this is still our fave hotel as this is where we first celebrated our nuptials and held our wedding!",4
Nil,weeseng12345,"The bath-tub stopper, despite many complaints remain un-usable. The shower door has an awful sound as if it’s cracking when u open it and there was really a fear of it coming off its hinges. Really expected more from a 5-star hotel. ",3
Exceptional Experience,jag79,"Having previously stayed at very highly-rated hotels like The Conrad and One Farrer on trips to Singapore, I wanted something extra special this time around to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday  Whilst looking into which hotel to book, The Fullerton Bay Hotel (FBH) caught my eye for a variety of reasons. Whilst certainly not inexpensive, the location, views, traveller reviews and rooftop pool ticked a lot of boxes for us as a family  One thing I did do before booking was reach out to the hotel directly to understand if there were any (Covid-related) time restrictions on access to the pool. Whilst many of the top hotels do have limits in place, I was relieved to learn that The FBH didn’t and this was the clincher for me, so I booked it  Prior to our arrival, the hotel did…",5
Wedding Anniversary Celebration,Alan Lay,"We had an enjoyable time, the food was great, the price was reasonable and the service is excellent. We specifically want to recognise Abdellah who has given us exceptional service, better than what I ever experience in any restaurant or hotels. He was extremely polite and attentive.

Fantastic!,511leroux,"The scenic view from the room is not only breathtaking but is also one of the highlights of the hotel. It is expensive for a one night stay but the staffs’ service, cleanliness, and top grade utilities are 5 star. I would dare say it is worth to pay a little extra to experience Fullerton Bay hotel at least once in your life:) ",5

Sea bass was fresh although duck confit was a tad on the salty side for my liking. Win was really helpful and apologetic, and changed my main dish. Great experience!",4
Ample of sightseeing attractions around,Sati,"Elegant scenic hotel ground, surrounded by plenty of attractions to enjoy around the area.  Carpark and some facilities like sauna are in separate buildings, a short walk away.  Bay view room are pretty standard, aside from the magnificent view. Bed wasn’t the most comfortable though and tv channels slightly limited.   High note really was the daily breakfast, palatable menu selections, served by au fait and attentive crew.   There are so much attractions and activities to explore around the hotel that our 4 days 3 nights stay passed in a blink, we were kept busy throughout the staycation and there’s still plenty to discover.   Will be scheduling our next visit soon for upcoming celebratory affair.",4

As was the incredible gentleman who helped us with our luggage when we entered the hotel - he addressed my husband and I by name when we got out of our taxi, and said goodbye to us when we were leaving. Thank you Mohammad! Overall, incredible stay: the arrival goodies in our room for our wedding anniversary, the special notes, the top notch service, the wonderful quality of food and staff.... the list goes on.

Worth the hype and price,Guy fromSG,"Booked a stay at this lovely property for my wife's birthday and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I have been eyeing this hotel for quite some time as I want to experience all the hype around it.      We booked the room  overlooking MBS and what a view it was. Those thinking of staying here should really stay in a room with this view as I feel it really justify the price.      The room was well furnished with things you expect from a 5 star hotel. The only thing I hated was the baby crib they provided, it looked like it wasn't being properly maintained. It was clean but it looked aged. And I had to bend down so low to pick up my baby. My poor back. Invest in a proper cot guys(Stokke).  Breakfast was a highlight with service prompt and staff being very proactive. The food was delicious…",5

Appreciate the duty managers for always looking out for us especially Michelle Muñoz .",5
Fullerton Bay Hotel CNY 2 nights stay,LINGCHEWREVIEW2021,The room view and design was great. Food at La Brasserie was only average for the price charged.  There should be more than one staff to tend the check in counter as I needed to wait for more than 10 minutes for my turn. The pillow is too thick and high for the neck. ,4
Cny lunch with colleagues & friends,Feng Ling,Ordered 3 course set lunch. Price is reasonable and food is tasty. Love the prawn which is the starter. Service from Abdellah is really good. He reminded us about our drinks when we did not knoe that it comes with the set lunch.,5

"Read the recent reviews, standard has dropped",Chen ws,"I didn’t actually stay at Fullerton Bay because the hotel screwed up my stay. I had book a stay for my birthday celebration, on a weekday. It was the start of school holiday in SINGAPORE. I checked in at about 3.30pm and was told that room was not ready. The person did not acknowledge my birthday or anything special. But it’s ok as long as I get my room. I was told to wait without any updates on the room availability, no offer of drinks or whatsoever.   At about 4.15,  was not ready and was told that it will only be available at earliest 5pm. I was pretty mad because I had a dinner at 6pm with my family. I asked for the duty manager and they offered me a temp day room at 5pm for me to rest before receiving my actual room key for the night.   I opted against it and chose to…",1

Pleasant and enjoyable stay,Mag Chan,"We stayed two nights at TFBH in Nov 2021.   We arrived earlier than check in time so we had to wait at the lobby for a while, but still the staff helped to arrange such that we could check in slightly earlier, which we appreciated.   The room was relatively spacious. It also had a proper working desk and chair, one seater sofas and access to the balcony — the latter turned out to be super useful as the room was often too cold, so we left the balcony door open once in a while. Bathroom was nice, spacious, and clean. Since we stayed two nights, housekeeping came to tidy up the room on the 2nd day. The housekeeping staff was really friendly and chatty and even asked about our preferences before tidying up.   Our room came with dining credits and breakfast. The former we spent at La…",4

AMAZING SERVICE FROM ALVIN,lovynn,"GREAT GREAT 7 Star Service from Alvin the butler! Booked a stay for My boss and his family at Fullerton bay for new year eve 2021 to new year 2022 for a birthday celebration.

Very very efficient too, he could book dinner reservations upon request to source for restaurants really quickly and at the last minute. Coordinated every little thing with lightning speed.

2 Star Service but Pay 5 Star,josho75,"1. When I was checking in, my husband and young child were behind me. And I had to ask the front desk employees if there is anything for kids, before they gave her a balloon and a card for 1 ice cream.  2. I stepped on a piece of used plaster with a spot of dried up blood on the carpet. Called the GM who returned my call in 7 minutes, but OMG, the hotel manager took 2 hours before we changed room. First she wanted to see for herself, then she said will clean the room, to which I said I'm not comfortable, so she said will move us to a room on same floor, after waiting, she called and said its a room on 1st floor, then 30mins later she called and said its a room on same floor and personally escorted us there. 3.

Nice enough hotel,yerawizardgeri,"The hotel itself is obviously very nice, so no qualms there. Most of the staff were great as well but had a rather unfortunate run-in with a concierge when we asked about USB ports in the room. First we were told there were USB ports in the tech panel and after correcting them and saying there were only AV and HDMI ports available, we asked if it would be possible to get a plug head for our cables. The concierge was kind of weird about it and said that since the hotel provides international outlets that was the best we ought to be able to hope for and that it was our responsibility to bring out own plug heads. Kind of a weird aggressive response to an innocuous request, especially in the year of our lord 2021 (and especially since the 2 other hotels we went to on our trip had…",3

Staycation at the Fullerton Bay Hotel,DrSMajumdar,"The place lived up to its reputation of a great location, views and service. The staff were very polite, friendly, helpful and efficient in responding to requests. However, there were a few areas the place could look into. (1) Not everything needs to be looked into via scanning a QR code. While the laundry service had a paper sheet with rates indicated, the mini-bar didn't provide this easy facility. (2) The menu was v limited at the breakfast (La Brasserie) and the bar (Lantern). (3) There were hardly any healthy food options at the same 2 outlets as well.",4

Room was amazing with the bay view. Toilet was spacious and the tub was able to fit two people.  Service was top notch all around but the only hiccup was during breakfast when we were asked to take a seat elsewhere while waiting for our turn in the queue. Our room number was taken down but another couple who came later was seated before us. Had to enter the restaurant to inform the staff. We were immediately seated after and we were fortunate that there was a table open as 17 minutes later, the last orders were taken. Earlier, we had waited 20 mins for our turn to enter.

"5 Star Facilities, 2 Star Service",TrueTruthfulness,"First time at the Fullerton Bay, but have stayed at other properties around the area. Fullerton Bay commands a price on par with the other big boys like the Ritz, but while the Property is lovely with views to die for of Marina Bay, the hotel is let down by service that is at best unpersonal, at worst, unprofessional.  First the check-in. Lobby is filled with waiting guest. Lobby staff are uninterested and in the 30 minutes before I went to grab a drink elsewhere, no effort whatsoever to provide even simple ice water or anything. At the end, check in only occurred after waiting 1 1/2 hours after the 3:00pm check-in time. No apologies was made, just a perfunctory ""we will extend the check out time to compensate you the lost time.""   Going to the brasserie to grab a drink / cake,…",2

Trust this hotel for events,Kristen,"The Fullerton Bay Hotel’s seamless blend of luxuries creates a happy setting for lounging, while The Fullerton Hotel mesmerises with her old Singapore charm.

A truly unique Singapore experience,Quek M,"Wonderful service team and beautiful scenery!! All in all, The room is truly worth its price! My family truly enjoy staying here and would love to return!!!  Special mentions to the kind and friendly associate at the pool and breakfast place. The concierge at checkout is also really helpful",5
Staycay well worth,samueldo92,"The place was very inviting. Walking into the hotel, the feel of the carpet and ambience was great. Love the spacious room and amazing view to wake up to every morning. The room cleaning service was also perfect! The pool was just nice but gym could be better with a rowing machine perhaps and a small barbell with weights? Nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves and would love to be back again ! Every one of your staff were super polite and welcoming during our stay here:)",5
Staycstion,dearjoyce,It was a good staycation with my family. Breakfast spread was good but the laksa was disappointing I had a spoonful of gravy it was bland :( however the eggs and toast were good. And of course the view was great!!! Worth every cent. Location wide it was accessible. ,5
A gem in the city,Principessaciu,"Service is attentive.  You can see smiles beyond the masks which is really rare these day.  We were here for staycation and had a great time.  The lantern bar is just fantastic, ask for a table by the edge and you can sit here for 2 hours just starring at the sea.",5
Anniversary Tea,Zaf,"Wonderful afternoon spent for an anniversary. We were grateful to have been seated with the view of MBS. It’s my first time having afternoon tea and the experience here was top notch. The pastries were super savoury, and plus the variety of tea is appreciated.   Special shout out to Daniel for attending to our needs and paying attention to us, making sure that we were enjoying our time there!",5
Staycation,jun0081,Bedding confirmed but wasn't delivered as expected. Front desk staff unable to rectify the issues. We were showed to the room and we have to come up with all kinds of work around just so that we don't have to cancel the stay.,3
"Good compared to lower end 5 star hotel, but fell short for luxury 5 star standards",Wexili,"I would recommend if the price is lower than 600 per night. Hardware and service are good, but compared to luxury hotels for more than 600 per night, it fell short on some instances.   Nobody came to help with my baby stroller and luggage when I arrived. After checking out, front desk directed me to concierge to get my luggage. Nobody was at the concierge. My taxi already reached and I had a hard time trying to get a staff for my luggage.  Breakfast was actually very good compared to lower-end and midrange hotels. But honestly, still lacks behind similar tiered Conrad, Ritz Carlton and the likes.  In room dining experience was awesome!  No turn-down service though.  Shower pressure was lower than expected.  Staff were super friendly and helpful. Loved the swimming pool as well!…",3
In Singapore a must,reisen910,excellent over all. he fullerton bay hotel is an excellent 5 * hotel in the Marina Bay Zone. the hotel has several restaurants and a rooftop bar. the welcome is friendly and the rooms are well furnished. hotel can be recommended very well ,5
Great place to celebrate a birthday!,653bennyc,"From the balloon to the messages on the cake, the birthday arrangements by the hotel were perfect! Highly recommended for an amazing birthday celebration! P/S: Include breakfast too, food was delicious with both western and local choices.",4
Shenton Suites,Lee K,The location of the hotel is central and there are many activities that you can do at the location of the hotel. The kids had great fun and the hotel did a wonderful in decorating the room for the kids. ,4
Disappointing experience,cwt810,"Our stay at the Fullerton bay hotel was disappointing. While making a reservation on email, the staff took almost 10 hours to respond. By the time they responded they then informed that they ran out of rooms. After I gave feedback they managed to make a room available for us. At check-in, staff were not welcoming nor friendly. At 3pm they told us the room was still not ready - this is standard check-in time and a well-run five star hotel should not fail this expectation. Upon giving feedback (which was met with unhappiness by the staff receiving it), they reluctantly changed our room and gave us one that was available. The room was old and dated with a noticeable hole in the curtains. In general, we noticed staff lacked motivation and pride in their work. The only positive is…",2
High Tea,Yoto,10/10 service  10/10 food   Would 10/10 recommend to those who have not been here. Super friendly and warm staff such a wonderful pleasant experience. Will be back for sure. They won my heart and support as a guest.,5

Fantastic hotel stay,Monica T,"Fantastic hotel stay  Food was exceptional  Service was great!  Dining credits made the stay really worthwhile. Love the view. We were on our honeymoon staycay and they provided loads of gifts like macaroon, wine, Fullerton Bear and Balloon. We felt really loved and comfortable during the stay.",5
Brilliant service,Majkhader,"FBH was an excellent stay. Spacious rooms, grand spaces. Bathrooms, bed area was spacious, and overall clean and welcoming. One amazing quality of this stay was the Bay view which overlooks the sea and a chorus of night lights which gives one the sense of calmness, almost meditative quality. Staff were friendly and polite and very accommodating. In room dining can be expensive but there are many restaurants near the Esplande and at Collyer quay. If you are prepared to walk 10 minutes more, there is much cheaper food at the small shops near Shenton way [just use google maps to discover them!}. Two staff were particularly helpful to us which was heaven sent since we had this staycation with our autistic 18 year old. Mathews who was a part timer in dining service staff was so kind…",5
Holding Wedding and Hotel stay,WenYeh90,"Everything went on smoothly. However, in the beginning when i arrived at the hotel, this is my first time driving and i have no idea where to park the car at the reserved area. No valet or hotel staff to assist or guide us where to park.  ",4
Family trip,Arrelta,We feel like staying in the world’s best hotel. Definitely will come back to visit again. The food and the swimming pool are great. The hotel staff gave us a call that the room is ready for us to check in,5
Enjoyable high tea.,Siew Gek Sng,"This is my first time having high tea here. The food and atmosphere are good with the view of MBS. There are a variety choice of drinks. I was served by the friendly staff, Lotha and Allan. I will sure be back and try more new menu. Hope to see the friendly staff again.",5
Definitely a cut above the rest of the hotels in Singapore,Clarence T,"I recently stayed at the Bay View Room at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. We tried to check in at 12pm, hoping to get an early check in. However, as our room was not ready yet, we registered at the front desk and was told that we would be called when the room is ready. At about 2.15pm, we receive a call saying that we would be able to go up to the room.  As it was my birthday, I emailed the hotel beforehand, asking for a small cake and room decoration, and was very happy they were able to do that. Even though the room and the view were amazing and we have seen countless photos of it, I was still pleasantly surprised by the view of MBS, as well as how spacious the room was.  As for the swimming pool, there was no need to pre book the time slots and we were able to enter whenever we…",5
"Friendly staff, good service but be aware of in-mini bar prices!",rickjwj,"Not the first time staying at the hotel. Generally quite good standard of food and service.  At the checkout, I realized that the 50ml belvedere bottle in the room mini bar cost $103.6!!! That implies an over $1000 price tag for a regular bottle! Our fault that my friend drank it without looking at the price list... Please take note",4
Weekend staycation,lowraymond,Great place for weekend relaxation. Service was excellent. Staff are attentive to your needs. Great location for shopping and sight seeing. Near nice eating places. View of marina bay sands. Near Singapore’s historic sites. ,5
Be careful of extra charges,yes6911933,"Be careful if you are seeking to upgrade your rooms, I was told by reservation officer the price I paid in extra for an extra night with an upgrade of room are all inclusive. However upon checkout, did I realise I had to pay and no the price wasn't that, it came as a rude bill shock and unpleasant experience.  La Brasserie wasn't much of a good dining experience either, preferential treatment to other guests.  Have stayed in so many hotels in SG, nice hotel but experience is one of the worst.",2
High Tea,Shi Ying,"Super posh nice view and comfortable setting. Love our friendly all the staffs are from entering the Lobby till The Landing Point.   Great service by the staff (Daniel, Olivia) at The Landing Point. Really love the hospitality here even though it was a trip to enjoy your high tea!",5
The best birthday staycation ever!,TinaRosli,It was our first time staying at FBH and I must say that I am very impressed with its customer service from the time we did our bookings right up to the food options (we are a Muslim family with young kids and older parents) we had at the Cafe. The kids enjoyed their free play time at the pool and the birthday deco was done very well. We were so happy that we wished we could extend our stay! Thank you for making our Dec holiday staycation the best ever! ,5
The best service,ALLAN L,I was told the view was beautiful.  It was indeed . But the most beautiful thing was the staff there . The service was the best. Friendly and attentive.

Breathtaking View and Topnotch Service,R Fernandez,"This is our second time at Fullerton Bay Hotel in 2021 and we absolutely love it! The room is spacious and the view is truly out of this world. Although the balcony gets pretty hot in the afternoon, that doesn’t stop me from lounging there with a book. The sunrise and sunset are spectacular. We are especially grateful for these short getaways in Singapore when travelling overseas isn’t ideal.   Special shout out to the lovely staff Mathews, Samuel and the attentive gentlemen at the pool for their impeccable service.   Note: Do get the bay view room. It’s really worth it!",5
High Tea,Jia Hua,Service here was great. The staff here (Daniel) was very professional friendly. Food selection is not too bad. The ambience here is also great to enjoy with a group of friends. Would recommend to others to try here.,5
Excellent high tea at landing point,snowy5979,"Wonderful food, excellent company and impeccable service from  Daniel has made this afternoon one that is unforgettable.  It was such a wonderful way to spend the day.  Will definitely be back to landing point in the coming months.",5
Just okay,syaf99,Had quite an expectation of the hotel. Was quite disappointed with the service rendered throughout the stay. Did not feel like it was worth the price. Breakfast was great though. The view from the room (and also the pool) was also breathtaking.,3
Worse Customer service Experience Ever @ The Landing Point!,Grace O,"I was looking a lounge where i can have coffee with my client on 10 Dec 2pm. And decided to go The Landing Point for a short coffee chat.   I was informed by the staff that we can have only 30mins as they need to prep for 3pm tea session. and so they have offered an outdoor sititng that can allow us to stay longer and we accepted it.   30mins plus later it was drizzeling abit, we were fine sitting outside with a bit rain and not critical to move. However, the rains gets bigger & bigger with big wind as well after 30mins later. So we request the staff if they can move us in since it raining so heavily with our bag on the seat getting wet as well.  But Landing point manager were not very customer orentiated with great service and can only tell us that there is no table inside…",1
Wedding and Staycation,baharbakar99,We would like to thank zaherah and team as well as Willy in charge of banquet for executing the perfect wedding for our daughter. We will definitely recommend them to our families and friends! Thank you!,5
Wonderful Staycation,Kenix_Sim,Room with a great view when you stay in the Bay View Room. The room was big and very clean and tidy. Friendly staffs. Check-in/out was smooth. The complimentary breakfast was the best tasty breakfast I ever had so far from a staycation. Complimentary car park coupon was given for the stay.,5
Just great for pretty views,Maisurah H,"The views from the room and every part of the hotel does not disappoint! However, food and service can be improved, especially at Lantern. Suggest to go just for a drink or two and not purchase the pre package. ",3
Staycation,Comel70,Really love the place…we were there for our 30th Anniversary.We have great staycation.  The staff all very friendly. Dinner was good. It serve in room.The breakfast also very nice.We going to book again next time,5
Great experience at Fullerton Bay Hotel,Suresh P,"Great place, rooms and experience. easily one of the best places I've stayed in Singapore. If you are looking for a hotel in the bay area it is easy to recommend Fullerton Bay Hotel. Great view, rooms and service. highly recommended! ",4
Romantic staycation for couples,AidanEmily,This hotel is very grand in architecture and service. Everything is done so well and everyone takes pride in their work. The customer service is great from beginning to end. The hotel ground is also peaceful and beautiful. One can appreciate the beauty of Singapore just by being around this hotel grounds.,5
Staycation,Regunarth,A nice place to stay with family with great amenities. Check in was an extremely slow and long process. Took over 2 hours before we reached our room. Otherwise the location is good with various restaurants and bars in walking distance. The staff are all very well-mannered and helpful with your needs.,4
Package,Trail699985,"We booked a family package which has 1 of the benefits stated "" Complimentary extra bed"" but in the end we did not get one though I thought I reserve quite early.  Hence, I would like to comment that if the hotel decide to rollout such package, it should allow all customer who book the package to be able to get the extra bed. Else it defeat the purpose of paying for such package.  And also to take into consideration for kids under 12, eg 11 will be difficult to share bed.",3
Great view,jakana2021,"The Bay view is excellent, that was the reason why we booked a room at Fullerton Bay.  The room is clean, staff efficient and breakfast spread is good.  However even considering all the plus points for such a hotel room in such a location with good services, the price is too steep for an average Singaporean who wish to go back for a second stay.",4
"Perfect view, perfect services",kynzhou,"Best hotel experience I’ve stayed so far! The marina bay view was awesome, hotel room was so clean. But most importantly the hotel staff was so accommodating. Thank you for assisting with my surprise balloon setup in the room for my boyfriend. Keep up the good services ❤️",5

Top Class with Some Blemishes,Knucklecurve35,"It's apparent that The Fullerton Bay strives to deliver excellence in all facets of the guest's experience. While I did see that quite often, I also dealt with some incidences that dampened the enjoyment of our stay. The first was during check-in when the guest who came after us was serviced first despite us standing in front of the counter for a few minutes, while he just came straight from the door. Secondly, the light would not turn on when I had to use the bathroom at 6am. Instead, an eye-searing emergency light flashed for minutes as a technician was trying to fix it. By the time the problem was resolved, it had almost been an hour and my jet lag was exacerbated since I arrived from an 18-hour flight from Los Angeles just the day prior.  It wouldn't be fair to not mention…",3
Found insect lavae or egg on hotel towel.,fkwahek,"We discovered insect lavae or egg on the hotel towel. We initially thought it was dust but upon closer look, we discovered it was indeed an insect lavae or egg. We called the operator who advised us to show it to a housekeeper of which we did.",3
My fav hotel in Singapore!,Calvinphua,"The view is absolutely gorgeous. Better than anywhere else I have stayed. Very thoughtful n nice gesture to provide balloon and cake, even though we checked in one day after my birthday. Service is always great especially all the staff in la brasserie during breakfast. Pool is not crowded and water tempt ideal for swimming. Love it! Will definitely be back! ",5

Shameful services,549sally,"Bad services at counter, never reply to our enquires on all the filipinno counter staff. The lady and the man. When checked out i spoke to the fair looking man at counter he gave a better impression at a more professional way. Slow check in and delayed for 1 hr.  Asked to add on bed the fillipino counter lady said will reply but never. The asked again house keeping and no reply.  The restaurant asked for chilli till food finished chilli not served.  Ordered coffee waited long has to ask again.  Shower gel used not top up second day not enough.  Carpet looks dirty. 5 stars hotel i rather chose MBS hotel. Worst the filippino man at the counter knew we were not happy with the checked in.  When i passed through the counter he stared at me not in a friendly way.  ",1

Splendid View and Excellent Service,barney892021,The entire experience at the hotel was superb and it gets top marks from me for fulfilling and checking all my boxes for what I look for in a hotel staycation.

Excellent service with mesmerising view.,Qing,"Fullerton Bay has never failed my family and I. Lotha, Emma and Olivia have been really helpful but Lotha is awesome! She’s so helpful and she made our wedding anniversary a memorable one. Lotha has been very kind with her words, and she takes extremely photogenic pictures! She’s the one to go to if you are looking for someone to take photograph for you. The atmosphere is great and we were constantly greeted by people who work here along the way. The view is as always mesmerising :) This is not our first time and it will never be our last time. Fullerton will always be our first choice be it for staycation, or high tea. Thank you Lotha, Emma and Olivia for making our high tea a splendid one.",5
would have been a straight 5 star if not for the poor after service,wenhuiloh14,the stay was overall awesome except for the extremely poor after service upon my checkout. I still waiting for a callback from you guys to update me on my  iPhone adaptor in the room. 3 calls has been made but nothing of interest from you guys to get it checked properly.,3
Couples weekend getaway,A Good Time,"For reference, I stayed in Bay View Room.   1. Great friendly staff  2. Room view goals! Beautiful backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands, and other iconic buildings.  3. Facilities are superb and clean. The jacuzzi tub and the pool also had views of MBS. It was a great time chilling in the tub and just seeing the busy city pass by.  4. The room is nicely decorated and even features a TV in the bathtub. But the room is much smaller than the rooms over at The Fullerton Hotel.  5. Food is okay, but with the overall grand ambience and company, all is good",5

Would definitely recommend for a cozy high tea for a lazy weekend :)",5
Classy and Clean,Greta L,"Experienced the Romance package with my husband at FBH on a Monday and Tuesday. The weather was great, food was amazing, view was spectacular.

Thank u for the Bay View Room, it was more than a husband and wife could ask for:) ",5
Exclusive yet utmost comfort,seiji m,"Top-quality accommodation and facilities in every corner of the hotel. Enjoyed “Extraordinary Staycation” in the center of the Island….

Honeymoon!!,Siti Muslihah,"Pros  - Food at La Brasserie breakfast was great.  - Concierge team was very welcoming and helpful with our luggages & complimentary parking tickets. - Room was amazing great complimentary tea (TWG) and coffee.  - Room also had a balcony and overlooks the marina bay sands soooo beautiful in the day and at night! - Swimming pool had both public and “private” smaller jacuzzi pools. The private ones were perfect for couples on a honeymoon like me and my husband!  Cons - we came at 3pm for check in and waited for 1.5hrs as room was not available yet.   Overall, fantastic stay!!! Highly recommended!! :)",5
Lovely stay !!,Yo2lmot,"Fullerton bay hotel was our third hotel in the week!!

Will definitely come back again!",5
Lovely hotel for first business trip in many months,pamarx2002,"I am over the moon about my stay at the Fullerton Bay.  I had a normal room, but it was large, well lit, and had a peaceful balcony overlooking customs house.  Sitting on the sofa on the balcony made all the difference.  Of course, everything else about the hotel, the service, etc is wonderful.   My only complaint is about the breakfast (boring, small portions, cheap ingredients) and the gym (tiny!  only two treadmills, of which one is blocked off due to covid), one bike and one elliptical.  One pulley weight stack, but falling very short of the five star standard.  I loved that the Fullerton Bay is a small hotel, but this was not good.   By contrast the swimming pool saved the day.  It was wide, 25M, and had an excellent view of Marina Bay Sands . I will come back! ",5
Unwind by the bay,Mohan_Prabhakar,"Superb stay for two nights in the theme room. The Fullerton Bay is just a great property in an amazingly scenic location with great views of and access to the bay. Great F&B within the hotel, and loads within a couple of minutes walking distance around it. Our suite package came with sweet complimentaries, like things in the minibar (excepting alcohol) and also free-flow drinks and snacks at the Lantern bar. Service was great with all of our requests from adapter plugs to decanters promptly met. Our corner suite had balconies on two sides with sweeping views all around the bay, so just sitting there with a glass of wine at golden hour made it worthwhile.",5

Average stay in Singapore,CLavinia93,"We stayed in 4 hotels across 1 week and this was by far the ""worst"" hotel experience. We were surprised as we were very much looking forward to our stay, but the entire experience from start to finish was so impersonal and lacking in service. No answer when we called down to the lobby for help, no turn down service, no help with baggage - definitely not what we'd consider a 5 star standard. If you're after a great view of the Marina bay, you could stay here but frankly, there are other phenomenal hotels in Singapore to stay at.",2
Great Staycation,wahiuzzaman,"Stayed for pre and post wedding. Very clean, hospitable staff, scenery was A1 for sunrise. Nice bed, fell into a deep sleep.

Amazing Staycation,Calvin O,"This staycation was to celebrate a special day for us and the Fullerton Bay team has been fantastic in providing a memorable stay for us. Starting from the check-in process, it was smooth and seamless. We were offered an early check-in at 10AM. The special complimentary arrangement that was requested was executed to perfection, with a pair of Fullerton bears and a helium ballon, plus a postcard and a box of macarons. This kind of attention to detail and going above and beyond for the hotel guests is what separate between a great hotel and a good one. The Bay View Room at level 6 gave us a superb view of the Marina Bay and the Fullerton Heritage zone from the balcony. Room was relatively spacious and sparkling clean. Breakfast at La Brasserie provided a huge variety of choices…",5

Room amenities top class with thick towels and cosy bathrobes. Restaurants - la Brasserie, Landing and Jade (at Fullerton), food all exquisitely prepared.  Service by dining staff very attentive - at breakfast, I went up to my room half way, when I returned and continued to finish the meal, the staff (didn’t see her name badge) came by and asked if she could bring another hot serving of egg.

A Flawless High Tea Experience,Darren T,"Been to a few high tea places in Singapore. This is simply my favourite. The experience starts from a smooth reservation, to warm service and impeccable food & beverages. In Oct 2021, we were treated to “Pink Afternoon Tea”, a initiative where part of the proceeds goes to Breast Cancer Foundation. The afternoon platter surprised me with a wide range of flavours, both savoury & sweet. Staff were very attentive (which can be rare in some F&B establishments). I never have to raised my hand once to get anything I need (which is even more rare, considering how impatient I usually am). The view faces Marina Bay Sands (we are sitting across the bay). Environment has plenty of day-light (which is perfect for instagrams. Overall, I am very pleased and would definitely consider coming…",5

Perfect Staycation!,mairin r,"My daughter and I did a staycation at the Fullerton Bay hotel a few nights ago, and everything about it was perfect! The staff could not have been nicer or more efficient, the room was extremely comfortable and well-stocked, and the facilities are top-notch! Our room was amazing and included a balcony, which I was not expecting. I picked it for the fact that our room included early check-in and late check-out so we could maximise our time there, as well as the fact that the pool slots are for 1.5 hour per day (most other hotels currently only offer one hour per day). The pool is gorgeous, and we loved our time spent there!

Dinner for 2,MitCh M,Good meal with a nice ambience. Steak was good. Portion is just nice for a guy like me (500g). Cod is nice but if you are not a herbs fan maybe the seasoning might not be for you.   Dine with Amex platinum card gives you 50% off main course so its quite worth it.,4

But I feel little disappointed as this is the first time the hotel we have stayed didn’t realise our birthday when check in. ( to name a few of the hotels we stayed before… Andaz, Mandarin oriental, and Raffles, all without failing to note our birthday when we checked in; then they sent us warm birthday wishes and even small cake and birthday card signed by staff …)  Anyway, we got a room facing CBD, no upgrade ( btw last time we stayed in Andaz and Raffles got upgraded even staying one night only)  The room is big in size, a bit aged, with a small tv.

Best hotel stay I've ever had in Singapore,Andrew Wang,"Stayed over with my wife for our anniversary and we had the most wonderous time ever, upon hearing that we were celebrating, they gave us a room upgrade to one facing MBS. This hotel is miles above any other hotel we've ever stayed in. Room service food was ok, but the service is insane, they get every single detail correct. The speed of everything was fast and well time. There was an in room chrome cast where you can play your own music. The bathtub was well equipped with bath salts and the rest of the regular amenities. Water pressure was good at the shower.

Knowing that we have 2 little ones, they prepared a children activity kit for them to play with. While we had in room dining due to the restrictions, they also prepare some sweet treats with my kids name customized to perk their sprits.

As per my previous email to General manager, the stay was very much because of an enjoyable one in Fullerton Hotel Singapore. The staff in Fullerton Bay Singapore have also provided such an impeccable service that made me book straightaway for another staycation during the week of my birthday.In fact, I will be back in the Fullerton Bay Hotel to have the Heritage Dim Sum Brunch this coming Sunday.   Truly enough, the staff that got me booked a second stay straight away was Samuel, the service staff from the front desk.

Afternoon High Tea,Grace W,"5 stars!  We were half an hour too early for the high tea to commence. However, instead of asking us to wait elsewhere and come back later, Maria offered us a table along the walkway to sit while waiting. We saw that there were table seatings closer to the glass window with a view, so we enquired if we could get the seats there. Unfortunately, as we made the booking late, she informed that it was fully booked but would make the arrangements if there was a cancellation. Shortly after, she came back to inform us that there was indeed a window table available for us. We were very pleased that she took action immediately to see if she could help us secure a window seating instead of brushing our request off.  Once we were seated, Maria also offered to get us glasses of water so that…",5

Celebrated my birthday here and they served a complimentary slice of cake and took a photo of us. The photo was eventually printed out as a form of memento for us to bring back, which is a super nice gesture. Food-wise, teas, coffees, scones and savouries are free flow while sweets are not. Items that left a good impression on me were the scones, King Salmon on Choux, Duck Rillettes on Saffron Mini Bagel and Coconut Raspberry-rose Ispahan. Overall, a really good place to visit if you want an enjoyable afternoon tea with a great view.",4

WOW Fullertonbay Hotel,Edvl17,"I’ve always thought that higher floor would have an amazing experience but I was proven wrong, as soon as I entered my designated Bayview at L1. I’ve already have an idea how luxurious the room would be, however the biggest surprise was the large balcony right in front of the  bay ( facing MBS) which almost give the same feeling when you’re seeing an infinity pool.  The Room It’s full of luxurious vibe, from the color of the interior to the furniture and fixture, filling a high-ceiling room. It felt large enough to enjoy your stay.  The Bed I’m so picky with linens , pillows, duvet/cover and the mattress… it’s definitely comfy and lux-Balmain! 😝The pillows aren’t the typical size, which I appreciate as it’s  good enough to pamper your head, legs and body.

Afternoon Tea at Fullerton Landing Point,Ashley Tan,"We truly enjoyed our afternoon at Landing Point and what really kept us coming back is the service staff there.   Today we were served by Emma.  When I shared with her that the vegan set today was a little disappointing compared to the last one I had, she then took the feedback to the Chef and came back with 2 new vegan items! This is truly an excellent example of putting customers in the heart of everything she does! She is also very friendly, very joyful and simply great person to speak with!    While the food may not have been 5star today, Emma service is what will bring me back again! Well done !",5

Loges and Zool provided outstanding 5-star service and crafted an unforgettable experience for my wife and I’s anniversary. When we arrived, we were escorted to our table overlooking the Marina Bay (killer view!), and while we planned on only having drinks, the staff, knowing it was our anniversary, had other plans in mind! Halfway through our drinks, Loges came over with a small complimentary cake and offered to take pictures of us to capture our special night.

Spectacular MBS view but there are rooms of improvement,SweetXF,"Stayed for one night to celebrate advance anniversary and boyfriend’s birthday. Very good hospitality of Fullerton Bay Hotel that they arranged amenities for us and worth paying upgrade for the bay view room. However, there are a few small issues that made our stay a little imperfect.  First, the reception staff wasn’t really look welcoming to us despite it was a weekday which the hotel’s occupancy shouldn’t be full. But it’s okay, understand that hotels are now facing Manning issue, he might have some other stuff to do. Second, information given was not correct regarding dining credit. However, the duty managers were helpful that they assisted us to sort it out. Sorry that I couldn’t get the first DM’s name, and the second one was a guy starts with Ba.. something. Third,…",3

Siibil who was taking care of the swimming pool was very attentive, and made sure we had everything we need.   I didn't catch his name, but the gentleman who checked me in was also very hospitable.   One of the best stays I've had anywhere, too bad today is only a short few hours, will have to come back again for sure.",5
A 5 Star Honeymoon in a 5 Star Hotel,tom,"We chose Fullerton Bay Hotel for our honeymoon because of the reviews. And boy did they deliver. What a wonderful experience. And it was exactly that, an experience, not a stay. Everything was near perfect, from the staffs to the room, to the view, to the food. The duty manager, Ummar was really friendly and he was really sweet to give us a 6pm late check out. That’s practically one more day in the room. We also met this nice uncle who was manning the pool who shared his experience with the hotel and made sure that we always hd ice cold water on that hot sunny day. Everyone we met on our Fullerton Bay experience deserves a personalised review but unfortunately i cannot remember all their names. Oh by the way, the bathtub has its own television.

My brother and I are writing this on behalf of our parents (we are nine year old twins),Dreamer53747747570,"My family went to the Fullerton Bay hotel for my Mom's birthday. It was one of the best hotels we have been to.  Here are a few reasons why:      First,  is that we got free ice cream ( which we loved ) with an ice cream ID/Pass that we could use ever day.  Another reason why we loved this hotel is our room and the hotel's pool was amazing.  Last but not least the hotel people were very welcoming. One example is someone opened the door for us . This was a amazing hotel because firstly we got free ice cream (and a cake for my mom's bday), second of all  we loved the amazing room and the pool, and finally the people are amazing. We love this hotel :D  We will definitely ask our parents to book again",5

Every stay at FBH is always full of surprises and pleasant experiences and I have nothing but praises for the excellent team here.   Alvin, the head butler, has been amazing in his service. His dedication and commitment to ensure the comfort of his guests are really commendable. He was always contactable via his phone and ensure that my needs are well taken care of. Although it was late in the night, he was still sharing the history and stories of the FBH with me for almost 30 mins. I could feel his passion for his job and FBH as he was sharing them with me.

The room service was very good, I mean the service support from the staff was really exclusive.  2. All the staff, the front office, room service and even the pool attendant, his name was Sibil - they were great. 3.

Wonderful staycation (and absolutely spoilt by the attentive staff),pvtryan25,"Celebrating a friend's birthday, we booked a 3 day staycation over the long weekend, having stayed and dined here several times before, and I must what sets this place apart is the service standards by all the staff.  At the breakfast venue (La Brasserie) three days in a row, we was totally spoilt by the ever attentive staff who dropped by every few minutes to check if I wanted to try something else from the menu, or if I needed extra drinks, sauces or condiments. To be honest, I felt slightly embarrassed by the attention, which you probably might not even get in a Michelin star restaurant.

We had our stay at the 6th floor, and the view of the entire skyline of Marina Bay sands was all of this world. Watching the sunrise and the sun sets from the balcony of our room only made the celebration of our 11th year anniversary evermore memorable. The staff of Fullerton Bay hotel took extra care of us during our stay as they noticed that we were celebrating our anniversary. The surprise us with a room upgrade, and an amazing bottle of champagne. In short, this was an unforgettable experience, and I cannot wait to stay with Fullerton Bay hotel again and again.",5

Best hotel in Singapore,Quang Ngo,"I've been to a few 5 stars hotel in Singapore, including Mandarin Oriental, MBS but this is the best one. We got the Bay View Room for 3 nights. It has a balcony; the view is fantastic. The room is spacious. We love the small details that made this better than other hotels such as: very soft bath robes; bath tub with a small pillow for your head; free TWG tea and coffee maker in the room. The swimming pool is pretty and clean. We love the food: The signature burger, the braised beef cheek, the afternoon tea with cakes, the daily breakfast and the dim sum brunch are all delicious and fulfilling.  In general, it's been a wonderful experience. We'll definitely return.",5

The staffs at La Brasserie went the extra mile to ensure that I was able to place order for the Father's Day tea set. 6.

Great BayView but had smoking neighbours. Poor sleep because of the thin/soft pillows.,Wilfred T,"[Positives] 1. It is the view. you get an absolutely unblocked view to MBS. you can chill by the balcony whole day. 2. the swimming pool is massive and tastefully designed with 2 x Jacuzzi by the sides. 3. Breakfast selection was ok. (much lesser selection than Fullerton Hotel) 4. Bath robes are probably the best across all hotels in Singapore. 5. we were celebrating valentine day and they placed 2 bears in the room for us. Tks!  [Negatives] 1. as the header suggested, yup, I had neighbours who smoked at the balcony beside me. not sure if it was to my left or right. everytime they smoked, we will just get back into the room. It is a non-smoking hotel, but well, if you are a smoker and you have an open balcony, you won't be able to resist the convenience.  2. the pillows are…",4

Room was decorated with balloons and also received a special welcome letter, a small gift like macaroons, chocolates and definitely a pair of cute Fullerton bears. View are wow and we can soak in the jacuzzi whole day.  Hotel staffs are very friendly and polite. They will greet you and ask if there is any feedback etc. I felt that their engineering team is really knowledgeable, they came to solve the issue on jacuzzi because the water pump is not very strong or not working properly.

"An incredible hotel, with impeccable decor and service",Hoe Nam,"This is my second visit to Fullerton Bay Hotel. I honestly wouldn't have chanced upon this hotel if not for COVID. The search for a staycation landed me at this beautiful hotel.  I stayed over during a semi lock down in Singapore. There was a promotion, and the hotel was selling with a complimentary night stay. It was a hard to resist offer.  Took the offer, and stayed two nights with the Premier Bay View Room (I had an upgrade). The view was fantastic. The sounds of lapping water against the hotel was extremely therapeutic. I could sit hours at the balcony and enjoy the view with the constant cool breeze.   The decor is impressive. Modern and yet classic. Service was fabulous.   Breakfast was served in the room. See picture. It is simply fabulous and out of this country.   I…",5

We enjoyed ourselves and adored this hotel so much that we even booked in an extra night's stay because we couldn't bear to leave!   As soon as we arrived, we were met with warm smiles of the staff who were so welcoming and friendly.

Terrible experience,Wila,"Wonder why this hotel is rated so high. First of all, Fullerton Bay and Fullerton has not much difference. My husband and I stayed both and we don’t see any special things which makes Fullerton Bay even though the price of stay is double. ( Didn’t get Bay view room) Second, the duty manager who assisted me and my husband was unprofessional . Had issues upon check out on the bill and the way he handle the issue made us very disappointed. Even though the email from the hotel clearly indicates that dining credit can be used at TOWN restaurants, the hotel has to investigate if they want to approve it or not. Not only we paid that upon the checkout but also they don’t show sincerity at all to solve the issue.  WE call them to give us updates. NOT THEM.  5 star? No. Don’t waste your…",1
Bayfront luxury oasis,Ric C,"The Fullerton Bay hotel has a couple of fantastic things going for it. First, being fairly new, it has all the nice modern fittings that sets it apart from other hotels in its class (and there aren’t many operating at this upper echelon of luxury anyway, and they are mostly older and dated). Second, and more importantly, it has an exclusive, unrivalled location on the bayfront promenade. Other hotels in the area can claim to have a bay view, but only the Fullerton Bay can boast to be right at the bayfront, over the water in fact.   Given this, it is absolutely incumbent that you minimally book a bay view room to fully enjoy the hotel’s unique appeal (yes, the premium over the entry rooms is totally worth it; it will make perfect sense every time you enter the room). Pair these…",5

We spotted 4 otters swimming at a distance away (their heads were bobbing up and down in the calm waters).   The swimming pool at the rooftop was great for a swim and due to safe distancing measures, it was not crowded at all. There were also 2 jacuzzi pools if you just wanted to dip in the waters and enjoy a bubble massage.   Loved breakfast very much! We enjoyed all the food we ordered -…",5
One last staycation before CB 1.5,Wan Ling P,Had a 2D1N stay over the weekend before CB 1.5 - the hotel is still as gorgeous as it is compared to 5 years ago. check in was swift and the room view is so great! Room size is spacious and clean. However i realized there wasn't any care pack in the room but lucky I brought extra mask and sanitizer with me so its fine.  Breakfast next day was in room dining due to the tightening of the measures. Breakfast orders came 98% correct with missing fruits and 1 wrong flavor for the yogurt. Still a job well done cos its really not easy to serve breakfast from room to room.   Overall a good stay !,4

Breakfast was served at La Brasserie and due to the pandemic, breakfast will be table served and for small eater like us, we only wanted small portion of everything on the menu. We requested from one of the staff who has a very lovely name, Princess. She was a great help to us by taking our order and informing the kitchen on our request.

We didn't managed to booked a slot for the hi-tea but we've managed to dine in the comfort of our room, away from the prying eyes.  Our kids got 1 complimentary scoope of ice cream each from La Brasserie but we only went for it upon check out. The girls were given their ice cream in porcelain bowls and they were eating in the lobby which I didn't like it. Would prefer if they were given it on cones.  Service wise, it was the best out of the suites we've stayed. Food always come on our requested time. Firs time we've not heard our kids harassing why their food are taking so long.   Room turn down services were…",5

"Snobbish, discriminatory doorman",john,"We came here since (1) it's a sister property of Fullerton Hotel across the street which we were staying in and (2) to check out the dining options since the restaurants can be charged to our room.    What we encountered:. Snobbish, rude and discriminatory service from your doorman (in glasses) who tried to chase my wife out while I was not around, and making snide remarks that our infant will 'make a lot of noise'.   Later when I drove over to pick up my wife and infant, the same doorman ran to me at the driveway to specially convey the following remarks: this hotel is 'not open to the public' and only 'hotel guests and guests with restaurant reservations' are allowed in.  Rude encounter experience at 5.30pm on 2nd May 2021.  You are the shame of the hospitality industry and if…",1

The Luxurious and Captivating Jewel on Marina Bay with a Soul,Natalie Tham,"We spent two nights at FBH for our staycation. There are three things, in our opinion, that make this hotel unbeatable:  1. The never-get-bored bay view from the Bay View Room 2. The amazing hotel breakfast that we look forward to having again 3. Emma, who served us at breakfasts and made us feel welcomed, pampered, and met our expectation of a five-star luxury hotel.  The hotel room was spotlessly clean to begin with. From the mirrors to the balcony, they cleaned every spot and it was totally dust-free. The bay view room made our stay a total luxury and relaxing at the same time.  The mattress was too soft and sinking for us but the Duty Manager, Julian got it replaced the next day after we raised our concern. He also sent us a fruit basket and a personalised note as a token of…",5
Great stay at Fullerton Bay,Elaine C,"Though expensive, it’s worth every dollar  Started from being warmly welcomed each time we come back to the hotel by Door man Asenth who remembers us during our stay, to the great hospitality by other staff as well.

Everything was well organized and for once, a staycation really felt like a staycation !",5
Afternoon Tea,verenalim2019,"East meets West afternoon tea. The variety and taste of the savoury and sweet delicacies are very well balanced. The sweetness is not overbearing so it is easy to swallow and gentle to your taste buds. The savoury also encompasses premium ingredients so it makes the entire course feel worthwhile. The chef did a very good job in selecting the flavours to complement the dishes together and balancing the sweetness mildly so it does not over power your senses negatively. A restaurant and afternoon tea I will be willing to go back again for, seeing how creative and tantalizing the dishes were concocted!",5

The Fullerton Bay Hotel staycation,chiongers,"Overall, a frendly and clean environment stay on 02 April, I would rate  7/10.  The missing points were for the hi-tea / restaurants where being fully booked n leaving no capacity for guests to enjoy the facilities. As a hotel guest, it is annoying all dine-in is not available ( except room service). It worsen when it rains heavily non-stop and got to be drenched to find  good around.",4
Fullerton Hotel Landing Point Hi-Tea A disappointment!,Foodieangel22,"Due to Covid-19 situation, the hi-tea at Landing Point is a disappointment. We paid $52+++ person for hi-tea from 3- 5.30pm. 1st round was 2 Trays of pastries and small nit bits as shown in my pictures. The food selection was so limited too. We waited so long for 2nd & 3rd round of top up for the food and coffee/tea as there is short of staff. But the hotel hi-tea was fully booked. I'm sure the hotel is aware that it is full booking for the hi-tea yet they are under- staff. We are unable to eat more as we waited so long for the top up. The drinks wait was long too.   Nonetheless, the staff is aware that we are unhappy and they apologise. They offer us 20% for Citibank Premier Miles card. But we paid $50 nett yet we ate so little and felt so dissatisfied and unhappy. Pre-covid…",3
Great stay with splendid bay views and top-notch customer service,303eileenl,"I was there with my family for staycation and had a memorable time in Fullerton bay hotel. It was my second stay here,however with a different view this time. My bay view room was facing MBS and ArtScience museum made it so magical.   The customer service was top-notch and I would like to mention Julian Chong specially who looked after my stay with great details. He went out of his way to make the guests their day with his special arrangements! I will definitely be back to stay in a different category room again and cannot wait to return for this wholesome experience. You will never regret staying in an exclusive hotel like this and it brings up the level for other hotels in Singapore.",4

Terrible experience,JR,"We booked the Fullerton bay hotel for our honeymoon staycation but was sorely disappointed by the experience.   The hotel room rate is on the premium end among hotel rates in Singapore and yet the TV near the bathtub area was not working and there were also no local channels available to watch for the main TV in the room. The main tv quality was also very grainy, making it very difficult to watch the other limited channels available. This meant that we basically couldn't even enjoy watching tv in a premium hotel room.   The buffet breakfast experience was also very poor. We were standing at the door within our designated dining timeslot but waited for a very long while and only received glances from the waiters and waitresses (they looked at us but did not acknowledge us at all…",1

Excellent Service and Enjoyable Stay,GracenNg,"Had a fantastic stay for my wedding anniversary. Room was clean and the the bay view room was awesome.  Purchased the stay through Klook, which we encountered hiccup with regards to the fine prints on the check out time. Was upset with the incorrect terms stated by Klook, which the hotel was initially unable to fulfil.  However, after speaking to the reception, Mr Bakthiar turned the tables around with his exceptional service and efforts in order to provide us with a solution that made our stay enjoyable for our special occasion.  Also, would like give credits to another service staff, Mr Syahir, who helped us in creating memories - taking photos for us with his impressive photo-taking skills, coupled with his customer-orientated service and friendly smile.

The Happy Hour drinks are very affordable and food was good too! A great place to chill out after a long week. Will return!! Thank you team..,5
Pleasurable experience at the La Brasserie,Bryan,"Excellent service by Kumar and Vijay. Love the ambiance and food.  The breads served along with the rillette was fantastic, the escargots with garlic bread was good but I would definitely  recommend the prawns with chorizo.  Soups were great but could have much more depth of flavour to the mushrooms. The onion soup was spot on and I enjoyed it  I had the beef cheek for my main course and I would prefer to have it served with sauce, nonetheless the meat was perfectly done. The lamb tasted wonderful with such succulent meat with aromatic herbs.  Dessert was satisfying, simple but never compromising on flavour  the apple desser with yuzu sorbet brightened my heavy meal after the mains. The brulee although rich in flavour was definitely a favorite.  I will love to be back here again…",4

Restaurant week dinner,Jacqueline T,Had a lovely restaurant week dinner at La Brasserie. Reasonably priced. Elegant ambience with attentive and personable service from Kumar and Vijay. Portions were reasonable though the mains tend to be small. Prawns and chorizo was yummy. French onion was great though we weren’t crazy about the mushroom soup. Lamb and beef were nicely done (just a bit small) and both desserts were pleasant to the palette.,5

Fantastic Birthday Weekend!,Nurul,"It was such an awesome choice to pick this hotel for my husband’s birthday celebration from the 20th to the 22nd of March.  It was walking distance to MBS, and it was such a scenic walk too!  The room gave an aura of old charm, and the balcony opens up to a breathtaking view, be it day or night. We were just content to sit at the balcony and listening to the sound of the water. There were all the amneties that we needed, and the toilet were clean, big and spacious. Nothing to complain about at all.  (Our room were Bay View)  As per the norm, you have to book a slot at the pool, at the gym etc. The pool was located nicely at the roof, and again, the view was amazing. There were plenty of sunbeds too.  Our room came w breakfast but we didn’t manage to go because we slept in. Bed…",5

EXCELLENT SERVICE BY KUMAR,Jasminetee123,"It was a lovely evening, coupled with a splendid view of the applauded CBD of our tiny red dot. It started with that, but that's just the start of it. We were pleasantly greeted by Kumar who made the entire evening a wonderful experience and we had the privilege to be attended by him for the rest of the evening. The food was aesthetically pleasing, I would like to highlight the prawns with chorizo and the halibut, tho it needed a dash of salt and pepper. I'm not so much of a dessert person but the Apple dessert did bring about a much-needed slight sugar rush for the evening. Would recommend, definitely. Look for Kumar, thank me later!",4
Great customer service,Chester L,"Kumar was excellent, always on the lookout if we needed any service and great people skills engaging with us. I gave 4 stars because of the food, perhaps due to restaurant week. The mushroom soup has a hint of Campbell and the creme brûlée felt mass produced. The mains (beef cheek and halibut) were excellent",4

Quite disappointed ,Geneve Guigue,"We got there almost 3pm and stated our room was not ready yet and not sure what specific time the room will be ready, i’m just shocked that one of the well know 5star hotel in SG would have something like this, we checked-in earlier last month in Fullerton Hotel the service was impeccable cannot help to compare with one another. I believed roughly 1 1/2 hour they informed us our room was ready. I must mention also while waiting for the room to be ready they took us to the Lantern bar to have refreshments which is nice gestures of them and the staff were very professional also on how they handle things. Evening time went to La Brassiere for dinner, waited another hour for our dessert to be serve, staff are apologetic and did not charge us also. Fullerton Bay hotel did not give me…",2

"Lovely service, well-prepared food",Philip N,"My wife and I had a staycation at Fullerton Bay Hotel, and decided to have dinner at La Brasserie. The food was very well “designed” - the Wagyu beef tartare was excellent, because the richness of the beef was balanced with the perfect amount of mustard, a mint mayonnaise, and given flair with caviar and shaved truffles. Definitely a must try. We also had the catch of the day, and the champignon and truffle soup; which were all great too. Our dessert was a dark chocolate “dome”, which was very rich and isn’t for the faint hearted. The real stars of the night were our servers, Mr Kumar and Ms Sunny. They were happy to accede to our requests (we shared the food, and they split the soup for us into 2 bowls), and were exceedingly friendly and helpful. It was a wonderful stay and…",5

This time round it was a disappointing experience. The jacuzzi room was fantastic.... beautiful view, check in counter staff were friendly and helpful. The head butler was very nice and helpful but it will be helpful to know he can assist us if we required. There is no spa facility, so we booked the service over at Fullerton hotel, it was shocking, it’s Friday so they said it’s weekend so no promotion package, wanted to sell us $800 package.

We were well looked after by the staff. Food was very nice and the service was friendly and professional. However it seemed that the very hard working staff were very busy all the time.

Excellent Fine Dining and Service,Pat,"We had a delightful time dining at La Brasserie for my birthday! We were initially enticed to try them out by the mix of delectable French cuisine and top quality wine featured on their website - and they did not disappoint! In fact, I might go as far as to say that the pictures on the website don’t do their food or the elegance of the restaurant enough justice. Our food was delicious from start to finish, emphasising traditional French dishes - such as escargot, onion soup and Confit de Canard, which we couldn’t get enough of. If you are as much a soup addict as I am, I highly recommend trying both the traditional onion and the champignon and truffle. They satisfy the palate with enough flavour to excite and not too much to drown. By the end of the second dish, I was already…",5

After we seated, we asked for a rather interesting wine recommendation (not sweet, dry and less fruity white wine). Thats when we were given utmost attention and after careful probing by the staff, we were served a sample glass. To my surprise, the staff nailed it! Shows how much they really cared for us.  Afterwards, we asked if we could move closer to the window for a view. The staff then went on to sort out reservations (due to last min. no show) and quickly got us the best table.

Time to refresh the hotel,Jry,"While Fullerton bay hotel is not bad, I think we much prefer Fullerton hotel across the street that is half the price with much better experience. We felt the difference in the hospitality when we had just 1 simple dinner in Fullerton hotel Town restaurant since Fullerton bay hotel was always full.   The staff in Fullertonbayhotel also seems to be confused and took hours to reply some simple questions like ‘Do we get a discount in the hotel restaurants?’ In the Fullerton hotel, the staff were very clear with the privileges of guests. They even told us which certain credit card will give us the best value. We were also greeted at least 3 times just in the Town restaurant at Fullerton hotel. It had much warmer welcome there.

We booked ahead to reserve vegan and vegetarian friendly high tea sets for part of our group, and regular sets for the rest. Landing Point and The Courtyard (both under Fullerton) are amongst the few choices in Singapore which cater to vegans and vegetarians-- and these sets are no less luxuriant and enjoyable than their non-vegetarian fare! There's even vegan clotted cream for the scones. It's always a treat to see the trays full of tasty morsels arrayed on the table.

"Pleasant stay, amazing service but not worth the price.",Espi6789,"What really made my experience at Fullerton Bay was the service. Staff were extremely attentive, accommodating, helpful and polite. My favourite parts of the hotel were definitely the pool and Lantern - amazing views to enjoy a cocktail and bar bites in the evening.  We were also there for our honeymoon and had mentioned it to the hotel. We were greeted with a very sad, deflated looking balloon and a bear with a handwritten note. It was extremely underwhelming especially for the luxurious branding of the esteemed ""Fullerton Bay Hotel"". We were not expecting much, but based on our experience with other hotels during birthdays / anniversaries in which we received complimentary cake / alcohol / room upgrades, Fullerton Bay fell extremely short. That was quite disappointing for us. …",3

"Disappointing, better options out there ",Jong O,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel between 29th and 31st December as a getaway during the holidays. Sad to say, we were a little disappointed with our stay even though the hotel looks impressive from outside.   Couple of issues / qualms during our stay:-  1) Late check in   We had arrived at around 6pm for our check in, only to find out that our room isn’t even ready and will take an hour plus before we can head up. I understand the need to ensure a high level of cleanliness and hygiene during this period, but with check out timings at 11am, I can’t understand why it took so long for the room to be prepped. Only thing the front desk could say was, sorry for the inconvenience. We only received the call from front desk that our room was ready at around 7.30pm when we were out for…",2

Boxing Day Brunch,Chris B,"We visited Le Brassiere restaurant located at The Fullerton Bay Hotel, Collier Quay, Singapore with two friends for the Free Flow Festive Brunch menu. The restaurant has an innovative way for guests to order their selection from the menu, using a QR code that links to an online ordering system.  Not only does this ensure one can pace oneself and avoid having all dishes served at the same time, when your selection arrives it has been freshly prepared.   We arrived at 12:00 noon and departed at 3:00pm, which says it all really. The staff are attentive & courteous and on hand to answer any questions regarding the self ordering process.

Most of the staff very friendly and make an effort to say hello and acknowledge you. It was also good to see the strong effort for disinfect and pandemic protection.  Will definitely recommend and return for our money nexts time. ,5

Awesome staycation experience!,Tom Lim,"I would like to compliment the hotel for giving us such a wonderful experience during these 3 days. Check in was pleasantly smooth, and the room was awesomely clean (with an equally awesome Bay view). In particular, I would like to especially compliment two staff who have made our stay at the hotel an exceptionally joyful one:  1) Oliver Shoh from Concierge  From the moment we stepped into the hotel, Oliver earnestly attended to our every single need, from settling our luggage during check-in and check-out to orientating us in the hotel to ensure that we are not “lost”. Every time we walked past concierge, he would also make it a point to chat with us and ask about our well-being. His presence alone gave us a sense of warmth and relief, especially when we returned to the hotel…",5
Anniversary celebration,Secsy26,Went for the afternoon tea at the landing point (festive menu) and we’re pleasantly treated to good food and fantastic service.

Rooftop pool is superb with great views. Not forgetting they have 2 small jacuzzi, which brings high marks to their hotel. Seriously price of the room is quite high but it’s totally worth it.

Covid-19 Wedding at The Fullertonbay Hotel,Ilma,"We held our wedding at The Clifford Pier and stayed in the room overlooking the Marina Bay. It was literal perfection from the get-go! We had quite a bit to carry from the lobby to the room but Asenth was truly the real MVP here, offering us help, transporting our heavy bags and making sure our belongings arrived to our room safely - all with a smile through his eyes (cause yknw, masks). The rooms were clean, huge and with a stellar view of MBS, the apple store, esplanade, etc. The staff were extremely accommodating and selfless (I had to ask for ice at 5am and they delivered it, again, with a smile through their eyes). The modern yet warmth architecture of the hotel, the staff and their service were truly amazing and I will definitely come back here even as a past bride.",5
Excellent high tea experience,weebph,"Went on my wife’s 40th birthday. The tea selection and pastries were good. Exceptional service by the staff (namely Lotha, XinRong, and Rose).

The bell man definitely make us feel very much welcome every time we go in and able to provide a very best in class service.  Some of the dining service staff in dining really provided very good service at the breakfast area while some didnt.   Regretted however calling the in-room dining since they were late or did not get the order from the mainline. Despite having called 2 times they didnt help me to check the order till the third time for us to call again, and we were really famished by the time they came. ",4
Proposal By Fiancé ,jeenalim,"Having worked as a front office executive myself, I must say that I was impressed by the services provided. My bf ( now fiancé ) booked the suite 0409 on the 26th to 28th November for his proposal. Gwendolyn, Ice and Maria helped out with the decorations and provided top notched services. I understand that having to work in the service industry requires passion, and they do have the passion to make the stay a memorable one for the guests.  Besides this, Oliver from the concierge was always there to greet us with a smile on his face! Very heartwarming.   Will definitely be back again! ",5

High tea at the landing point,Sneo2802,"Went to have high tea recently at the Landing point, read about long queues at weekends and Long waiting list, so took leave to go on a weekday. Place is nicely furnished with sofa settees and feels comfortable, however food was a letdown. We were served tea or coffee of our choice and you can change later on if you decide to have another beverage. Food was served on a 3 tier carrier, very nicely arranged, and just enough for 2 pax. The food is refillable and will be served to you. Kueh pie tee shell was dry n hard, ingredients inside were made very dry so as not to make the shell soggy. Pastry with beef rendang was also made very dry for the same reasons. Chicken sandwiches were just so so. The only thing that I liked were the lemon tarts. The other items did not leave much to…",3
Birthday staycation,Lollipop,Informed FBH beforehand that the staycation was meant for birthday celebration and truly appreciate that they prepared a complimentary slice of cake and birthday balloon for this. However I think it would be more surprised for the celebrant if the cake + balloon were already there by the time we entered the room. They didn't provide candle though. Couldn't find bath salt in the bathroom. Went to the swimming pool by reservation but don't think they maintained an in & out record as we can just go in the pool area without giving our room number. Seems like anyone can just enter without making reservation. All the pool-chairs were taken when we reached. Time limit for each group is supposed to be 90 mins and we fully utilised it. However I saw there are groups of people there more…,4
Great service,Nelly Y,"Great  service from the service staff daniel , Emma and Maria.  They were attentive and helpful to our needs    Good selection of tea for the afternoon tea set but the savory food item could have more variety.",5

Best staycation (so far) :),Leah Loy," I can say it’s one of the best hotels in Singapore!  Everything was perfect from the time we arrived. All staff are warm, you will feel at home.  Check-in was smooth even we’re early.   We feel luxurious with our beautiful bay view room plus amazing club privilege with evening free flow of selected cocktails, wines and other drinks which comes along with canapes.   What a great spot to do some touristy stuff especially, visiting Merlion.   Kudos to the Fullerton Bay Hotel team! Just superb for everything.  ",5
Birthday Weekend,Sean N,"We were fortunate to stay in the Robinson Suite with incredible views of Marina Bay, I doubt there is a better hotel room in the city!  The front office team seemed to be understaffed during our stay as we faced issues with checkin (there was nobody at checkin) and on the Sunday despite the pool being open for hours there was nobody there initially (no towels or able to order drinks etc) a quick call to reception and this was resolved for the 18+ people at the pool.  The F&B team during brunch and dinner canapés were very attentive and highly recommended experiences. ",3
Comfy stay,Prashanth,My wife and I had a comfortable and memorable stay at Fullerton Bay. The staff were attentive and the hotel is nestled at the bay with an amazing view of the harbour.

Luxurious stay in the city,Tartan69,"To celebrate my birthday we spent the night in the Fullerton Bay. The property is stunning with sweeping views out to MBS and the city centre.  Even though it was pricey, I thought may as well splurge on a harbour view room and it was beautiful. We had a delicious breakfast (order buffet from a la carte). We also ate a lovely lunch by the pool.   Gym is quite small for a property this size but the pool is enormous. A huge thanks goes to the Concierge Oliver. He was showing me to my room and I mentioned it was my birthday. The next thing I knew, there was cake and a balloon arriving... now that's service!",5

Unpleasant Staycation,allrise841,"This 5 stars hotel doesn't get my recognition. First, check in was late for 45mins. Everyone who check in later then us get their room. Was told the room is still cleaning in progress and that other customers room are different. How different can a Deluxe and Premier room be that they need longer time to clean. Though Manager offer complimentary dine-in and late check out as part of compensation, the food is ONLY Warm and not hot for Steak and Lobster Roll. As breakfast is no longer in buffet style, I understand the slight delay in serving. However, got to wait another 40 mins for a bowl of laska is unacceptable. And best part, I'm the first to arrive and order, but again, the last to get the dish while others gotten their laska again first when they came later.. Waited 40mins…",1

A Charisma-tic Brunch Experience,DG2917,"It was not the first time for me dining in Clifford Pier at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. I enjoyed the Heritage Brunch very much and decided to visit again last Sunday with my Husband. It was his first time. The food quality and ambience is always a five star experience but this visit of mine turned into a six star visit due to the attentiveness by F&B colleague, Ms Charisma.   She has been very accommodating to our needs, constantly checking our table if we needed extra food and even took initiative to introduce the Preferred membership to me. Her every visit to our table was very consistent yet not robotic. She made us feel very exclusive and this is what the Clifford Pier dining experience should be like. Before I left the restaurant, I even took the initiative to ask for means…",5

Check in was smooth, we booked a corner King room which was really nice with great views. They had organised a small slice of cake with Happy Birthday on it. Nice touch. However from then on the experience for the next 24 hours was disappointing.  Unfortunately it's a long list and it's little details that make a big difference and distinguishes 5* hotels from others:  1) On arrival at the pool we were given towels but no other offer of service, not even complimentary water.

Had Pinot Grigio and Chardonnay - give them a miss pls. Red wine by the glass is way better value. Twice as much and quality twice as good as the white! ambience was superb so long is not a sunny day. Nice gesture of small plate of fries complementary.   Only downside was it was raining half way into Happy hour, all customers move their seats into sheltered area. Though is ""outdoor but sheltered"".

Enjoyable buffet lunch,Kelvin Su,We thoroughly enjoyed our buffet lunch here with our 3-year-old daughter. The waiters were attentive to her needs as they served her child-friendly cutlery and serving sizes. It’s really admirable for the staff to serve children respectfully as they would with any adult customer. They also accommodated our requests for reduced serving sizes so we could appreciate almost every delectable dish from the mains menu. Alan has been exceptionally warm and friendly every time he approaches us to ask if we have any other need. We’d definitely recommend this for families and couples.,5

Wonderful Hi Tea Experience,loke_ang,"My sister and i decided to bring our mum out on a weekday to do a Hi Tea at The Landing Point. It was the first time we did a Hi Tea for just the 3 of us so we were very excited about that. Before the day came, The landing Point called to confirm the reservation and to enquire if any special diet needs. They went on to enquire if it would be a special event so that they could prepare something for us. It was a very good gesture right from the start. On that day, we were seated facing great view of the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer and the ArtScience Museum. Terrific views! We ordered 2 sets of Hi Tea, some ala- carte and had 2 rounds of Champagne. Nice brand they had! The staffs were very attentive and we were warmly served by Ms. Lotha. She was especially attentive to…",5

Definitely the best hotel in Singapore,Bryan C,"We've been trying different hotels in Singapore, and the Fullerton Bay (and Fullerton) is definitely the best in Singapore. They have one of the best locations, combined with elegant rooms and their service is absolutely unsurpassed. We've stayed at Capella, the Raffles Hotel, and the St Regis several times, but the Fullerton beats them in one way or another. We always feel at home at the Fullerton because of the warmth and attentiveness of every member of the staff. I couldn't remember everyone's names, but Daniel at the door, Alvin, and Alagesh were all very helpful during our stay. The rooms themselves were modern yet elegant, the desks were very useful for us as we were working during the daytime.  It had been more than 5 years since we last stayed at the Fullerton (it was…",5
FBH over 2020 NDP weekend,Terry,"Stayed over the National Day weekend in 2020 during phase 2 of circuit breaker. Booked under Amex Fine Hotel and Resorts.  Minor hiccups during check-in due to the safety measures in place. Arrived around 11am or so as we were worried that car park might be full, sadly we only managed to get our room around 2pm. The staff was apologetic and Christine offered to buy us lunch at Landing Point (which we declined as we had breakfast at Clifford) while waiting. This is a trying time for most as many have just restarted operations and are trying to deal with the multitude of requirements by the government.  I’ve stayed at Fullerton and Fullerton Bay is on another level. A way to describe the experience at FBH is to put it as equivalent to first class on SQ. We were booked for the…",5

I would like to thank the staff (from the front door to the concierge to the cleaning and room service to the pool/gym staff) for making my experience such a pleasant stay - we felt very well taken care of and the staff members were very accommodating in our requests, so that my loved one and I could have a special stay at both Fullerton Hotel and Fullerton Bay Hotel.   We booked the suite package, so we also had a free one-way transfer, that was surprisingly upgraded to a Rolls Royce!

In terms of desserts, we all felt the macaroon was the best. Thank you to the staff for the nice platters and great service. They took a nice picture for us and printed it out! That was a nice touch.

Remembered when it was open space, with some kiosks and where we took boats to the southern islands.   We didn’t know that the Hotel was attached to the pier before our visit. When we arrived at the Hotel, we were flummoxed with the changes to Clifford Pier! It’s now a restaurant, serving dim sum.  The restaurant was closed. It was Clifford Pier unrecognisable if not for the familiar arches. Looks grand and posh!  Dinner at La Brasserie was enjoyable. I wanted the steak and frites (apparently it is good) but they were out of it. Settled for the lamb, which was only ok! My wife had the duck confit, which was very good (she allowed me a bite).  …",4

"Exquisite Hotel Roof terrace, with the Best view in Singapore.",Fitsy1962,"Although we didn't stay at this hotel, we had a jolly good look around. I will most definitely consider a stay on my next visit. It is perfectly placed, almost opposite The Marina Bay sands hotel, offering in my opinion the best view anywhere in Singapore. There is a beautiful terrace on the ground floor looking across the bay offering very comfortable seating. Access to this terrace appeared to be through the main Resturant. This had a very plush, upmarket feel. We glanced at the menu which was as expected for the quality of this Resturant. We didn't eat there so, cannot comment on the food, but believe me I wouldn't hesitate for a special occasion. The hotel itself is spotlessly clean, with an air of opulence  and beauty. The staff were very helpful, and  happy with us looking…",5

BEST HOTEL IN SINGAPORE!,rpchandi,"Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore is the best hotel in Singapore.  I have been staying in this hotel for many years and the service, food, and overall comfort is unmatched.  Rhea and her team at the front desk have never failed to extend the best service by making each stay always memorable.  All the staff in the hotel address me personally and as a regular guest, I am always given priorities for room categories or upgrades.  Each time I come in to the room, it is always filled with different goodies and local cakes which are my favorite.  Rhea, from the front desk, never fails to surprise us on different occasions whenever we are checked in the hotel.  I am a frequent flyer to Singapore, and I have stayed in all the top hotels in Singapore.  There is not other hotel than Fullerton…",5

Great food and ambience,TravelerAlumn89,Food was really amazing. Service was excellent by Kumar and the team's attention to detail was superb.

Chef and Manager went above and beyond at Clifford Pier.,HT50,Selan was extremely hospitable. I feel like I am dining in his home. I casually mentioned that I prefer the previous version of a dish and he volunteered to ask the chef to do it. Chef Boon obliged and customized the dish that is currently not on the menu.  Best service I have had for a long time in Singapore. Outstanding.  I can observe that Selan is not only good at customer service but also a good motivator and leader of his staff.,5

The food is exquisite but I really need to give a shout-out especially to the French Onion soup - best I’ve ever had!

Nothing in The Lion City Comes Close,SBB4,"I have been a loyal guest at the Fullerton Bay since the first time I stayed there. I believe I've tried every room category, been there at every time of year, and I'm always greeted by the gracious and incredibly amicable Ms Rhea Decolongan, the Hotel Manager.   The hotel offers a more intimate and modern feel than its sister across the road, which I much prefer. Never have I not been welcomed as family at the Fullerton Bay. The breakfasts are spectacular, but not quite as spectacular as the pool area and its Lantern Bar which in my opinion is the most stylish and enjoyable place for a drink in Singapore.  I relish every moment of my stays at the Fullerton Bay - from the signature scent as soon as you walk in and see the spectacular Clifford Pier, to the no-contest best…",5

Fantastic service, spectacular staff, exceptional breakfast. However, seems like management has changed a bit.   Hotel staff were not as warm and welcoming as last time. I mean, they used to know who u were around the hotel. Like even people at the pool would know who u were. My only warm greeting was the day I was checking out and the manager came to ask me if everything was great and left me his card, so I could contact him if I returned next time.   Look, I will keep it simple. Great hotel, definitely stay. I will keep returning, but it doesn't feel like the old FBH. Feels like it doesn't really justify the price tag as well anymore.... a…",3

Relaxed atmosphere,NT78,"We enjoyed a light dinner and drinks outside. Great service by Kumar, place was quiet (monday). Can recommend the vegetarian burger.

High tea at The Fullerton Bay Hotel,Joerg W,"We had a spontaneous high tea at The Landing Point and we're lucky to have a table for the 5 of us. The ambience, selection of tea and coffee is fabulous. Our waitress Lotha was very attentive to our table and made sure we had a great time and took perfect family photos for us. Much recommended to experience this venue.",5
Great experience,Marissa,"My girlfriends and I had a great time together at The Landing Point. Service was exceptional. Staff, Mr Idrus & Mr Prakash who I think is the manager on duty were very attentive and friendly to us all. They were both observant by making sure our drinks were refilled and canapés offered when depleting. Both of the staff made effort to have small talks with us and even entertained our 2yr old boy that we brought along. Never have I seen them checking on us & other guests without a smile on their faces. Being in the service industry myself, I believe that these small touches plays an important role in making sure guests/customers feel welcome and comfortable. Bonus was, a surprise birthday cake were preapared for my friend & I and we got a small momento of a photograph of us that…",5

Amazing experience at the Landing point.,janicetohh,"Ambient is casual and comfortable with awe scenery across.  Location is easy to access.  The staffs are professional in their work, Idrus is friendly and proactive. They offers wide range of beverages to choose from. Our favourite is the silver moon tea.   A little too sweet on the sweet range, but overall are still acceptable.  Savoury food is good, will definitely come back again.",5
Great place and ambience,Arthur H,"Was a great place with great ambience. Service was great and staff were helpful. Food needs more variety though but is decent. The view is also fantastic. Good place to layback and relax, would recommend this place",4

Outstanding hotel with one fatal flaw,salemgh,"I would have given this hotel a solid 5 stars if not for one fatal flaw, therefore deducting one star:  -service is impeccable. From reception, to breakfast, to room service, my parents (whom I offered a staycation there) only had the greatest feedback. I spent lots of time with them there too.   -rooms are spotless with some of the greatest views in Singapore. Finishing, freshness, decor are all top-rate.   -I’ve stayed in many hotels in Singapore and I believe this one tops them all in every category.   -however, the fact that toilets don’t have washers/water hoses to clean up after using them is inexcusable. All hotels at this price point offer either automatic washlets or at least access to a sprayer to clean up. This is a deal breaker for me and showcases poor hygiene…",4

Sundown Soiree at the Landing Point,Michael Y,"I don't typically review my visits and trips to hotels, but I have to share a very wonderful evening at the Landing Point, in the Fullerton Bay Hotel.   We reserved a Sundown Soiree, which is essentially a high tea held in the evening. We were welcomed at the door of the hotel, guided to the Landing Point and seated quickly and professionally, with warmth and without any fuss.   The high tea was quickly served, and the food was good. The selection of teas was extensive, and a point to note for future diners is that both the food and the tea are refillable - and you are free to try out the different types of tea available. It makes for a wonderful meal, really.   The view was amazing - overlooking the bay and across to the Marina Bay Sands. The ambiance too - just the right…",5
