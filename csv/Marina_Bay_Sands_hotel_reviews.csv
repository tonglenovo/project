Fantastic Hotel - A Must Stay,Paul C,"It was my first time to Singapore which was for the F1 and I am so glad I had the chance to stay at Marina Bay Sands. What an experience and what a hotel!! The service from check in all the way until check out was incredible. Spacious rooms, attentive staff, complimentary mini bar plus the famous infinity pool are a must for anyone looking to stay. The countless food options and top restaurants on site are fantastic for any foodie. Can’t wait to be back and will only stay at MBS!!",5,September 2022,Travelled with friends
MBS a luxurious destination,bengch,"We are a family of 6 ( my 85 yearold father, 79 year old mother, my sis-in-law and his sons flew in from Canada and myself ),the room upgrade (Merlion Suite facing gardens by the bay)was very much appreaciated!My 2 nephews flew in from Canada and were celebratin their birthday as well, so having us all in 1 room was a big surprise as well as  the complimentary cakes.The suite was of course luxurious, the complimentary tea, coffee, drinks and chocolates were a big hit.Booking is simple online, the check-in process could be improve especially for the unintiated like where do we look for the queue numbers although 1 unpleasant encounter was when a guest claimed that our queue number was his and proceeded to the counter , I was baffled as the prompt in my phone stated my check-in was completed already while we are still queueing  up behind the counter. I needed to asked for help for this and turned out the guest claimed he has our queue number, the receptionist just proceeded to check him in without counter-checking like asked him to show the queue number from his phone. Anyway, the staff whom I called for help come to out rescue and all is good again.I am also gratefull that the wheelchair I requested for my 85 year old father was sent straight to the room, should’ve asked for my 79 year old mother as well If I only knew it would be easy to request.The room service butler was very responsive and the staffs sent to us for assistance for our needs were very respectful, knowledgeable and attentive , kudos to Leah( room -in dining dinner, very promptly she set up our table and has very friendly attitue)Cecil( gave the surprise cakes , she is very amicable and friendly)Nadrajan( our first contact after check-in, he asked if the wheelchair will be used at that time or we prefer to send in to our room and before he left the room he distinctly explained about what butler phone can do,the key cards although he explaine the electricity card but we cannot find the slot he was saying) ,the guy who brought our ice cubes whom I failed to get his name and the one who enlightened us about the electricity acrd which our room does not need to use it,the guy who brought in our breakfast but I failed to get his nameLaura from Infinity pool whom you can tell her sincerity in making sure we are taken cared of , she asked Leo to assist my dad and mom while they are visiting the pool. One not so good experience was during breakfast when we went down to RISE restaurant , our 2 rooms originally booked does not include breakfast but from what Mary staff from check in told us that we can go to RISE or SPAGO for breakfast without reservation, so when we queued up the staff from RISE asked for my name and room number and when she checked our original room has no inclusion of breakfast but I asked if we can still eat and pay , she said no so we just went back to our room and ordered in for room service. I called and checked why we were sent away, the phone butler staff checked then called again and claimed there was no record we approached RISE eventhough restaurant staff asked to spell out my name and after awhile called us to head down with already a table reserved for us but I declined since we already ordered for breakfast room service. I failed to get the RISE staff’s name as we were  already flustered, anyway we moved on after that since we have the breakfast in our room already and proceeded to the Infinity pool, of course the reason we booked at MBS was the pool and we were not disappointed , from the booking for the date slot and the messages sent whether the pool is temporarily closed because of the inclement weather as well as its opening once available is very much helpful and as I mentioned Laura from the Infinity pool is a darling, she is very sincere. The photo also was an experience, the photographer was friendly and does not impose, it’s nice that other than the printed photos, the digital photos were available to the guests. Check-out was easy as can check out from the TV although as 2 rooms initially was booked only  1 room was billed and able to check out from the TV so needed to check put from the front desk , Victor helped us out from the front desk to check out and settle our bill for our stay. The Merlion suite of course has the wow factor already its spacious and clean,the furnitures are comfortable, the mini bar was well equipped, the toilet in the bathroom can have a bidet perhaps , the bathtub is super comfy, the massage room and the hair washing room does not come with any information how to use it though , the downside of staying in the Merlion Suite is we almost refused  to leave the room. The overall experience we had was very memorable, and yes we will come and check-in again…",5,July 2022,Travelled with family
Debit card charged without refund after check out 1 month ago,Kelvin T,"Stay from 05 sep to 08 sep 2022. Hotel requested a security deposit of Sgd 400 which i offered my debit card.  To my horror, it was debited rather than hold charge. After 1 month, i queried the credit process back to card. However, they said they paid me in cash during check out when i check out via express boxes which we simply drop the key cards to a machine.  Im still pressing for an answer. I suspected they got mixed up with other rooms.",1,September 2022,Travelled as a couple
Best View of Singapore,Adarsh Prasad J V,Marina Bay sands is a must visit place for anyone who would like to view Singapore from top. I would recommend you visit in the evening as there is a light show which is awesome and also the sky scrapers and everything around you is lit up and its breathtaking. Would highly recommend this for everyone visiting Singapore.,5,September 2022,
The New Icon of Singapore,JoonBond,"One of the best hotels in Singapore, the garden view has an open balcony, and the city has the most spectacular view of the Marina Bay area, including the water laser show, Spectra.  The Garden view is to see the sunrise; the city view is to see the sunset. Booth ate a spectacular view.  During special occasions, taking a city view is a good choice.",5,July 2022,Travelled as a couple
Excellent,melbournewato,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands for three nights.  This hotel was excellent and as we loved the pool.   However, out of all the hotels I have stayed at, I would like to say a special Thank You to Marina Bay Sands.   On our holiday (we went to a few places), my 10 year old  son became ill and became dehydrated.    By the time we reached Marina Bay Sands, it was becoming obvious that he was not well.    I contacted the front desk and the staff organised an ambulance and a doctor to come to examine him.  Marina Bay Sands security helped take my son in a wheelchair to the ambulance and assisted us with our passports and details we would need to take to the hospital.  The  staff at Marina Bay Sands simply went above and beyond.  My son went onto make  a very speedy recovery after going to A&E at the hospital.  Yes - I thought the room we had was excellent.  The hotel was wonderful and such a good location.    Above all though I would like to say a heartfelt thanks to the staff who really did care about us in our hour of need. I would like to say heartfelt  thank you for making us feel so special and taking care of my son while we visited Singapore.  Thank you.…",5,September 2022,
A Hotel that is heaven for Adults but not great for families/kids.,Rashaan Tristan Ji Chand,"We arrived in Singapore as a family. Beforehand, we arrived to 2 different hotels that were cheap and reliable. When we first arrived to Marina Bay Sands, we were stupefied to see how many adults were in the hotel. At that time, it was school holidays in most parts of the world. The check-in time was at 4:00pm as well. When we first arrived to our room, it was pretty standard for a $1000 SD per night hotel. Nevertheless, the facilities were superior for adults. Consequently, Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel for adults ONLY.",3,October 2022,
Surprisingly personal service at this huge hotel,Martin J,"It's an enormous, sprawling hotel, and the check-in experience was similar to checking-in at an airport - not ideal.  However, it was clear after a few encounters with the staff that despite the fact that we were 4 people of thousands of people passing through,  that this hotel was special.  Each interaction with the superb staff felt personal and the staff were fully invested in us having a great time.  I'd single out the following staff for exceptional service:  Concierge (and Clef D'Or holder) -  Muzaffar - he went the extra mile to help us book our night safari Pool-side manager - Maurice (one of the nicest Aussie's I've met) Pool life guard - Mo ( a one in a million character)",5,July 2022,
Singapore’s best,Maan F,We had such a lovely time in MBS! The service is outstanding and the facilities are simply amazing. Singapore’s best hotel totally did not disappoint. Plus points that we were given a generous upgrade from Garden view to City view.,5,August 2022,Travelled with family
Vegas at Singapore,Arvind_Meera,This was my 2nd time at MBS. I had a great stay. I would like to say that this time I experienced an even better service. The room service was very prompt. The waiting time for breakfast was much less. Also the breakfast selection was very nice.  The staff was very helpful as I had arrived early and the check-in executive gave me a temporary card to access the pool and the health club so I could relax and shower by the time my room was being readied up.  The views from the hotel is undoubtedly amazing.,5,September 2022,Travelled on business
Unique experience,Witold,"We were receiving invitations to Marina Bay Sands for the last 7 years or more. Last summer we decided to visit Singapore and, stay in this hotel. All Bay, View, rooms were already booked, so we took Garden View room on the opposite, side of the tower No 3. This turned out to be the best choice. All rooms with Bay view have no opening windows nor the balconies, however the Garden View rooms are having this, advantage. You can slide yoyr glass open and, enjoy the view from your balcony including evening concerts  in the gardens with illumination of the artificial forest. All services were perfect. Laundry exceptionally good. Rooftop swimming pool Cristal clean and staff serving free drinks. Dining at, Rise restaurant opulent and very well served. The only thing I can not…",5,September 2022,

Everything was just perfect, the room, decor, cleanliness (spotless), customer service, food…ooo, and let’s not forget the infinity pool, amazing!

Thank you so much for making my first Singapore visit so memorable and such a pleasant experience! I will definitely come back!  Highly recommended!",5,September 2022,
THE HOTEL IS MORE INTRESTED IN QAUNTITY RATHER THAN THE QUALITY,neil h,"The rooms were not ready - and this was at 4.30 pm,, 90 minutes past check in time, it was very busy, and looks so much like, the hotel is more interested in quantity rather than the quality or the guest.  The room was dirty, with large staining on the bed, which we had to ask to be changed - no dressing gowns or slippers.  We had young adults with us - who asked at the pool area, about the music venue, on this floor (of which we could have booked, but was told the night club might suit them better), so didnt book, when they went to the nightclub, it was shut - they went back to floor 57 (i think it was 57), to be told oh sorry - yes i gave you thee wrong info - but then wouldn't let them as it was full, and they didnt book - although advised not to.

Almost perfect honeymoon trip,mississippisky78,"This could be a long overdue review since we stayed at Marina Bay Sands Singapore last 31st of July which was our most awaited honeymoon destination. We booked for 3 nights stay to a premium room. Everything was planned perfectly until we arrived in the hotel. There was a flocked of people everywhere, we don’t have any idea what was going on upon entering the door. We approached a gentleman wearing a black suit that we wanted to checked in and we found out that we could not check in because the hotel was having a system down. My husband and I wanted to melt down coming from a long flight only to found out that we could not get our room upon arriving the hotel. It was around half past 3 o clock when we arrived.

"Our room was out of this world, the place to stay is Marina Bay!",meganbonner_,"I visited Marina Bay for 2 nights on our way to Bali. Lots to share to help everyone make their decision if this is the place to stay in Singapore (we believe it is.)  Food - visited Spago and Cest la vie bar. Be clear when you book Spago if you want the fine dining as we made this mistake and we couldn’t then get a reservation at the fine dining as it was fully booked and they have a strict dress code so my boyfriend in shorts and a shirt wouldn’t have been allowed in anyway. The food was okay but we didn’t get to experience the fine dining which I’m sure would be out of this world.  Pool - way more impressive by night than by day.

Great stay,Squidy Travels,"I enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands, our room was a Garden View which was excellent. We could watch the Supertree show from our balcony which was a really cool experience because you could see the whole thing, as opposed to when you're actually at the Supertree show you only get a partial view. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, Nicholas who checked us in was excellent, he was so helpful and made sure we knew everything about the hotel that we needed to. Candy in the gift shop was also wonderful, so friendly and helpful. The pool is an awesome experience, as it wasn't peak season we got to go a few times.

Way Overpriced,Bea,"Way overpriced for what you get.  Don’t get me wrong the view of the pool was amazing but without that the hotel is nothing.  Was £1000 for one night, and not worth it. I had dirty bedding which had to be changed. We couldn’t get into any of the roof top bars which I think as we were a hotel guest for one night we should have been Abel to. That was very disappointing.  The room wasn’t wow, which for that amount of money was also very disappointing. We spent most of our time at the infinity sky pool which was amazing but the only amazing thing of our stay. Had this been half the price perhaps I would have been more wowed but it’s defo not worth the money of the stay!  I had paid half the price of this for hotels which have been outstanding.",3,September 2022,Travelled with family
Very terrible experience,Wilbur Lim,"4 hours for hotel to arrange a room despite check-in @3.45pm, followed by 2 different versions of why the lengthy wait occured.

Linda at ORIGIN + BLOOM...,gregfdxx,"Just want to take the time to recognize one of the nicest people on staff. Every morning we woke up at 5:50 am to have the pool all to ourselves.  At 6:50 my companion would leave the pool and head down to the Cafe ORIGIN + BLOOM. The coffee is great. But without fail, my companion, Maria, would return with our coffee saying how nice Linda at the front counter was to her. This happened every morning. Linda remembered our orders and always had a warm smile. So yeah, the hotel is amazing but always remember, its the people working there that makes it so. ",5,September 2022,Travelled with friends
Doesn’t live up to the hype,Afi69,"Besides the view from higher floor there’s nothing special about the hotel.   The customer service is very poor, which will take you by surprise compared to other 5 star luxury hotels.   Check-in process is long and there isn’t proper sitting/waiting area. Staff aren’t the friendliest.   Also would like to add the hotel is super crowded partly due to connecting with the mall I suppose.

Very expensive to stay here - you don’t get the ambience that you expect,William S,We stayed at Marina Bay for 3 nights - 26/29 Aug Hotel is very busy -  they have trouble coping with the number of guests - we had to wait 40 minutes to check in.

Great service and the infinity pool was worth it!,Iordanka P,"The service at the hotel was great and attentive; I had a wonderful welcome gift from the hotel. However, at the price of almost $1000 dollars a night that should be pretty standard. The pool was wonderful to experience and it is great that there was no time limit. It was not crowded at all and enjoyed the pool as well as the hot tubs overlooking the ships. For me it was a must do for the pool but I don't think I would spend the money again since there wasn't much else to justify the high price tag.

Not all it’s cracked up to be!,Jue,"Obviously a very luxurious stay but feels more like a business resort than a hotel. We were a honeymoon couple but they weren’t bothered by that. We choose this hotel thinking it would be the best in Singapore but were left feeling a bit deflated. A lot more work is needed in making guests feel like they are in-fact staying in the best hotel in Singapore.

Welcome to Disneyland Mall,Kevin,"Stayed at MBS for the first time and was disappointed at the long checkin lines, crowded infinity pool, and overall retail atmosphere of the hotel. All restaurants were overbooked and reservations had to be made months in advance. After spending more than $1000 on integrated resort purchases we were told that our loyalty points would expire in 12 months with no option to redeem destination dollars online. Our Prestige status would also be downgraded if we did not continue to spend. This is not how you treat loyal customers! As a tourist, this discourages me from returning to MBS. Very commercialized hotel with poor concern for customers.

During our stay there, we went to the pool as many times as we could and easily found lounge chairs.  My only complaint is that the pool is not heated so it can get cold especially in the mornings.  The food at the restaurants and the food court was delicious.  The hotel is walking distance from one of the hawker centers (Lau Pa Sat) passing the marina into downtown.

In the front is the city view that overlooks the water and on the left is the Garden by the bay view. The infinity pool has great views too. A little crowded but we managed to take some great photos. They were short staff but service is still top notch. The night view is best with lights up from Garden of the Bay as well as the city view. There is no time limit to using the pool.,4,August 2022,
Great views but....,CiderMonkey,"It seems to be a must do while in the city.  Once you get to the top there are great views but like everything else in Singapore (apart from the trains) it is expensive to eat/drink there. As a visitor you need to pay to get to the top platform but are restricted in the areas you can go to unless you are a resident - as in you cannot go to the infinity pool.  Cost per person is $22SGD/£13/16USD as of February 2020. The views of the city and shoreline are great, it overlooks the F1 circuit and I would consider it a must do on a visit.  If you can afford to stay there you will get much more however as a tourist it should be on your Singapore bucket list.  It is also great to wander around the ground and mall on ground level.",4,September 2021,

However, the reception staff Alice was genuinely concerned about us as we just arrived following a long flight and she noted it was my birthday, she ensured escalating the matter to her manager Lydia who took care of us very well.

Moe the ICON of MBS 🤩,GlobeTrotting324936,I travelled with my best friend to Singapore in July for a week and we decided to spoil ourselves and stay at the beautiful Marina Bay Sands hotel. On the 57th floor was the ICONIC infinity pool that had the most amazing views.  During our stay we met the very entertaining lifeguard Moe. He honestly made our stay so much fun. Moe was there every day to greet us with a smile and fluff our sun bed pillows 😂  We would joke and livestream so all our family and friends would join in the fun and Moe became the face of our social media lives and so he got the name ICON MOE of MBS 🤩 If you are looking for a great time away with 10 ⭐️ service Moe will give you a fun holiday to remember. All our family and friends can’t wait to meet Moe 😍,5,July 2022,Travelled with friends
What a stunner,davlis,"Wow what an amazing experience. We had booked an orchard suite for 1 night and the hotel went over and above our expectations. Right from check in where we were met by Jasmine and taken to the lounge to check in we knew this was going to be a great time.  We were early so took a look around the shoppes shopping mall and was then called when our room was ready.  Our main contact Mac took us to the room and we were blown away by the views and standard of the room.  We then visited the infinity pool which was incredible.  We then decided to book another night at MBS, due to the upcoming national holiday the suite was not available but Mac sorted it so we had a premium room and he arranged for all of our luggage to be transferred while we visited gardens by the bay.

Marina Bay Sands,ML7,"The infinity pool is awesome. I recommend the first time to visit the pool at dark, it is just amazing. At sunset is very crowded and in my opinion it is even more impressive in the dark and there is not much going on. From the rooms I was unfortunately a little disappointed, you pay the high price only for the pool, the rest of the hotel is below the renowned 5 star competition. The associated shopping center is also spectacular and one of the largest I have ever seen.

Best time at this hotel! Pool was the highlight of trip!,Susie B,"Staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore was amazing! I must say the pool was without a doubt the highlight for my family. Not only was the view breathtaking  and service great but Moe ,one of the lifeguards ,made it one of the most memorable stays I think we’ll ever have. He instantly made sure we had everything we needed, helped take pictures of us and was so helpful in giving us information about the area. We looked forward to seeing him every day we went to the pool!. We can’t wait to go back to see Moe!! What a terrific, kind human being!! You all are very lucky to have him!

The view is of course outstanding but we also got in touch with Mr Moe Lamit working at the infinity pool. He was so friendly, offered to make pictures of us and shared insider ideas abt Singapore.

Best pool in the world!,Emma T,"We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. The view from the room was amazing - and even more breathtaking from the infinity pool!   I recommend that you book your restaurants well in advance of your vacation. Sadly most of the restaurants at the hotel were fully booked for the duration of our stay, which didn’t leave many options for us. Room service took a very long time, which is understandable given the size of the hotel.  We appreciated the chocolates offered to us by the hotel, as a gift for our honeymoon.   We were very impressed with the housekeeping staff who did an amazing job.   The hotel is in walking distance of the Gardens on the Bay, which is a great activity for tourists.   Definitely the place to stay in Singapore!",4,July 2022,Travelled as a couple

A Singapore Classic,JanC,"The Marina Bay Sands is a great hotel but its beigeness is starting to look a little dated.  The views are outstanding and the location is very impressive.  Tonnes of overpriced designer stores, and a relatively close food court and other good eating options nearby, seemingly for the Mainland Chinese visitors, good access for MRT and Taxis are almost non stop.   The rooms were large and very comfortable, we all loved the automatic curtains and the large bathrooms.  The Gardens by the bay are a great experience with the shuttle if the idea of a walk in 28c doesn't appeal to you.  The nearby Art and Science museum was an unexpectedly fun trip and worth the visit if you have kids or a curious nature.  Its so large its almost tiring to walk around and the lifts make it a bit complex…",4,July 2022,
Great but….,Mohammed Paracha,"I’m staying at the hotel at the moment and I wanted to give my initial impressions.  The check-in process as well as booking to use the infinity pool are a bit quirky. Both require registration within 24 hours of arrival but the system was down when I tried and the backup mobile number also did not work. Slightly unusually, the reservations team does not seem to be as accessible as in other hotels (a bit slow). Prior to arrival, you are certainly left feeling that you have booked at a five-star hotel, but you are not being treated as an essential customer.  Upon arrival, we had a short wait during our registered check-in period but once all the paperwork had been completed (took longer than checking in at other hotels) we were left to our room and started enjoying the premises. …",3,August 2022,Travelled with family

We spent an intire day first row in the world renowned infinity pool. To be honest - this is why we booked a room here. One thing we did not understand is why the signage told that children had to be above 13 yrs to enter, but a lot of 7-8-9 yr old still splashed around, ruining the experience for other guests. Why???

The lady there was very helpful and took us through all the perks/features of the hotel.  Make sure you sign up for the MBS rewards card before you go so you can get the points.  Make sure you scan it everytime you go shopping or dine in.  The rewards are well worth it.  At the Infinity Pool we had Moe play photographer (his one of the many lifesavers). Then throughout the day they hand out free ice creams and juices.  I love that there is a adults only section of the infinity pool.

An experience to remember!,Charles Nguyen,"If this is your first time to Singapore, staying here is a must. It is expensive but it’s worth the money. If you want to save money, go through Booking.com, but the rooms you’ll get will be the lower floors and least desirable. If you book directly with the hotel, you may get the better rooms. I would double check both sites first to compare the rates before you book.  Now, let’s talk about the hotel. It’s iconic and the most beautiful hotel in the city. The location is unbeatable. You can literally spend a week there if you could afford it. There’s three main towers connected by a long lobby on the bottom and the infinity pool on top. You have to be a guest in order to use the infinity pool.  The hotel is connected by two underground walkways to a shopping complex that has…",5,June 2022,Travelled with family

We were very well looked after by the staff,  who even left us a nice welcome surprise in our room as they were aware we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary.  It is a busy hotel and at times you will have to queue but this is expected when you staying at 2000+ room hotel! The staff did an amazing job to look after us and room and food choice was excellent.  We used Club 55 which is definitely worth the upgrade and never had any lunch as we were so full up with afternoon tea and evening drinks.

A must do,MJLSK,"This hotel is a must do in Singapore because of it’s amazing pool and the views. We had 2 rooms, one on 21st floor and one on 48th floor and both had the harbour view. I would totally recommend them over the city view rooms. Not only I think that the garden/harbour view is simply nicer but also because they have balconies which is amazing in the evenings as you can look at the many ships and the gardens by the bay. The lower floor room had a really big balcony and a super close view of the light and music show in the gardens. The upper floor room had a small balcony so could only stand there or alternatively sit in the room with the doors open. Both were great for different reasons. If I could have any negative comment then I wasn’t too impressed with the bed. It was rather on…",5,June 2022,Travelled with family
View from the rooms is to die for.,tagme,"The hotel is huge and connected to a mall. The best part of the hotel is its infinity pool on the 57th floor, the view is just breath taking. We took the city side rooms and it was a great view from the room. The room size is also good for the price you pay. This is the first hotel i have experienced where even kids had their individual key card. Kids felt special when they got their own key cards. the sofa cum bed dint have the best comfort, but was ok. they should have provided with a little more thicker beds. We would feel the springs in the sofa cum beds. The main beds were very comfortable. No complains there.",4,June 2022,

Family friendly resort feel more than 5 star luxury,Jennifer M,"We have always wanted to stay here after seeing the beautiful photos of the pool and building.

They provided lots if bottled water in the room which was nice.  The pools view is as spectacular as you see in photos, BUT what they don’t show you is how crowded it actually is with screaming splashing children alllllll over (not just in the children’s pool) .

Famous landmark and pool,bcheong,"Staying here for 2 weeks. Maybe due to tower 2 closed for renovations, the hotel is near full occupancy. Couldn’t book a suite and settled for a room with “garden” view. The garden is the supertree grove so pretty cool. Got a low 12th floor so pretty disappinted  The porter is helpful, the front desk pretty grumpy. The rest of the staff from housekeeping to operators to gym/pool staff are thankfully as pleasant as the porter  The room is ok sized with a generous balcony and 50-60 inch flat screen tv. The bed is disapponting - not king sized nor luxurious. Towels too, are worn and cheap feeling.

Excellent hotel but shocking breakfast service!,TravellerG,"The hotel is beautiful and the infinity pool is incredible! It’s a real flaw that you can only access the pool from tower 3 and not the other 2 towers. Staff were excellent throughout except for at breakfast. Breakfast service in the Rise was extremely poor. We had to wait 15-20 minutes in large queues, even when there were empty tables that were simply not being cleaned. In a hotel that prides itself on efficiency, this was very poor. Even getting water at breakfast was bad as the lady “serving” kept running out of glasses and took ages to get new ones. One elderly guest even resorted to bringing a bowl to get water as they needed some to take their medication! Overall the hotel and service was excellent but breakfast service was utterly terrible and needs to be sorted.",4,May 2022,Travelled as a couple

Special shout out to Maurice, Mary & Ryan.  Location is also close to so many attractions and food options.  Only small criticism we have is the breakfast in Spago.

Staff are outstanding. Facility is beautiful- beyond words. Infinity pool awesome- no longer any limits on time you can spend at the pool. Food super pricey as expected. 3 mini sliders and 2 drinks at the pool for $70 USD. Highly recommend 1 night stay for the experience.

"Great view, but train station feeling",Axel,"Stayed in many 5 Star Hotels in Singapore over the years. The MBS has clearly a great view! Impressive!  Yet, the lobby is like a train station, busy noisy, friendly yet very nusy staff. Breakfast isn't recommended, but Chinese lunch was ok to good.  The pool and view terrace on top of the iconic building is a bit over regulated. Certain areas couldn't be accessed for picturing (alneit bekng empty) and it was entirely clear why the staff follows such procedures.  Rooms are good but a bit dated. Gym is great, good views, and friendly staff.  I wouldn't want to stay there and rather pick other places.",3,May 2022,Travelled on business

Fabulous hotel ... but don't expect to seep on Saturday night!,LiFletch,"The hotel is lovely - we've had fantastic meals in a couple of the restaurants (Spago, Lavo), have been to the infinity pool and had breakfast at Rise.

Just in from Australia, we were in Rise for breakfast at 7am - no queues. We also visited the infinity pool at 9am rather than one of the busier parts of the day. Yes it can be busy but you can plan around it. The downside that you can't plan around, is the behaviour of other guests.

Amazing location & facility. That’s it though.,Traveler’s choice 0000,"This is an amazing place, the location is incredible and the facility has great amenities.  However this is where it begins and ends.  Breakfast- wait in a line for up to 10 mins to be seated each morning. Wait in another line for up to 10 mins at most food station. A very uneasy and stressful way to begin your day on a vacation.   Staff- perhaps due to covid, bad management or lack of care the staff are generally quite rude.  Particularly the staff at the pool area. It’s closer to an asylum rather than a pool. From being greeted with “are you going to your room’ rather than a hello or good morning.

Overpriced View,nomad07,"I am basing my review on equivalent hotels worldwide at the price of over $600 a night which what I paid per night.  Firstly I booked a City View and the room has an incredible view, we slept with the blinds open as it was so amazing.  We were on level 35.  The room is good, but not amazing for this price.  The room we had at the Hyatt was double the size for less money and the service was equally as good.  You could only book the famous infinity pool for 1 hour a day that is it and the spaces are limited, so you may end up like many people with a timeslot that is not great.  The gym was the same, you have to book which was relatively simple, but we arrived after the Singapore NY festivities, so it was alot quieter.

Very Pathetic Customer Service,Tiak Kweng W,"I booked two rooms for 2 days for my family of 6 under the Sandsational Staycation package over the Christmas holidays. On the MBS website, it says that complimentary breakfast would be provided if you sign up as a Sands Reward Member. What I experienced was having to jump through multiple hoops and walking back and forth between Tower 1 and Tower 3 on multiple occasions to get the breakfast voucher. To the hotel's credit and our pleasant surprise, they allowed us to check in early at 9 a.m. and the process at Tower 3 reception was smooth. However, we were told to go to Tower 1 Sands Rewards counter to get our physical membership card. When I went there in the afternoon, there was a long queue at the counter.

First and last time here,Hana C,So much for safe distancing when there is no proper waiting area and massive crowd waiting to checkin. Everyone just standing in crowds outside the shops. Massive waiting times to check in. We understand COVID-19 is leading to more checks and measures but to wait 1-2 hours for checkin is really unacceptable.  Service level below average for the supposed top tier hotel. And more long queues for breakfast at the hotel. Management needs to look at themselves as to why there are long queues everywhere. Poor staffing planning. The poor staff are overworked and overwhelmed due to shortage of staff. Looks like the existing staff need to cover 3 persons work at the expense of 1.  Social distancing measures are a joke. Having stayed at other hotels the intrusion of privacy and constant…,2,December 2021,Travelled with family

The room was very classy, clean and had a great view of the Gardens by the bay. We booked our pool slot in advance and loved the view from the top too. Despite the ever-changing measures for Covid (we could not dine in at that time), I had to order food as takeaway from restaurants. The food was packed well and I made sure to order it before the dinner crowd arrived. Some of the entrances and exits were a bit confusing though.

Staycation - 2 nights with breakfast and $100 dining credits,Woon T,I stayed at marina bay sands for 2 nights. This is a large hotel and there are things to take note of.   1. Booking or pool  You can book for a slot at the infinity pool 1 day prior to check in. For our stay. We have 3  slots. 1 slot per day. Each 1 hour 15 mins.  You can book all slots at the same time.  I would advise you to book earlier as many slots are not available when I tried to book.   2. Check in  The check in time is at 3pm. I reached the hotel at 2:45 and have a hard time self parking. In the end I valet park instead. The hotel car parking is surprisingly full with many cars waiting for an empty lot.   In the end I was at the check in counter at 3:10.

Few hotels in the can match the breathtaking panorama from the 2000+ guest rooms. My advice is to opt for one with a city view.   Rooms are impeccably appointed and cleaned.  Mine ($500 per night) is humongous with two very huge independently controlled LCD TV.

The other only reason is the ICONI reason to take a pic at the infinity pool and dine at Spagos....ooops and not forgetting if you love gamblings and dorning the MBS Bath Robe and walking all over the shopping mall.

Break from routine,Lingws,"Manage to get a stay here. The view is awesome. Same with the renown infinity pool. The boat shaped hotel suspended above 3 towers allows the rooms to have a unblocked view of the oceans or the city.  Checking in was super efficient, rooms were clean and well stock.   Have the Marina Bay Sands Casino at the lobby level as well as a 3 storey shopping mall as annexe.   Food variety and restaurants are aplenty.

The pool area as expected was really nice I was not impressed with the check-in system, you're asked what time we want to arrive, we arrived, only for the lady to tell us we would have to wait 10 min ok no problem, then another gentleman said it would be 20-40min wait!!!  Thankfully it was more like a 7min wait.

Hence I feel we got more of the VIP service. Read on below!  Check-in: Now, prioir to arriving at the hotel, I knew that MBS was infamous for it's massive waitlines, and they had implemented an SMS-Queue Number kind of system for regular guests. But for this occasion, I was instructed to go to the valet lane, where a bellman was standing by to help unload my bags, a valet driver swiftly took my name and gave me a car tag before whisking my car away.

For a hotel that has hundreds of rooms, there are only 18 seats in tower 1.   I kid you not. No other spaces are available, good luck if you are trying to multitask and rush out some last minute work because there is NO SINGLE AVAILABLE SPACE. You have to snatch one of the 18 seats if possible, from one of the hundreds of people standing around in the lobby.  The weird acyclic light installation is super precious - you cannot rest your laptop on it, but children can crawl all over it. I didn’t know laptops are heavier than children.  If you have no adequate seating, ensure your checkin process is staggered out and quick.

Upon check-in, we waited for about 30mins for the extra bed to be assigned to our room (we booked for 3 adults). Housekeeping was prompt in doing their cleaning services, but the room service took some time for any request to be sent over. We understood it could be a peak period during that time. The TV  network was intermittent, as it kept on hanging. We would like to suggest the hotel to have some Malayscian good channels.  Toilet does not have a toilet spray bidet. Crowd control was good at the hotel lobby.  Overall we love the view and the cleanliness of the room.",4,August 2021,

The premier room was not too special but the suite was actually an unforgettable  experience. The orchid suite at MBS, way up on 53rd floor tower 3, in my opinion is a much better experience than suites I have reviewed on TripAdvisor at St. Regis, Sofitel, Fairmont, or Andaz. Absolutely go for this suite if given the option.  Since we spent a week, we saw stunning, dramatic weather, rapidly changing, and really beautiful sunrises and vistas across the strait and Singapore. The air was incredibly clear the last few days, doesn't happen too often in Singapore, and could easily see into the coastal cities and industry going on in both Malaysia…",5,August 2021,

He also arranged special complimentary extras as it was my partner's birthday.   Zack from the Infinity Pool was very kind and sympathetic. He promptly offered us an additional slot to the pool without anyone of us asking (the pool being limited to  1h15 per room per day at that time).

When we were in the jacuzzi another guy came to tell us our time was up when we have only been in the jacuzzi for not more than 6 mins. Our session would only end at 12:12 so this guy then told us to use only till 12:10 as there was another group waiting to use the jacuzzi.

Rooms were good. Food was good. We had stayed in this hotel in Feb 2019 but we still miss the infinity pool. The best part of the hotel was the infinity pool. The view was breath taking.

Enjoyable Staycay!,Emily,"My fiancé and I had a really enjoyable staycay for his birthday at MBS. The check-in staff (I didn’t manage to get his name) was very friendly and gladly offered us complimentary room upgrade when we requested. He also arranged for a small cake to be sent up to our room after he knew we are celebrating my fiancé’s birthday.  We would also like to specially thank one infinity pool staff named Leo, whom really made our day by offering us complimentary cocktails when he knew the occasion. He was very chirpy and helpful the two times we met him at the pool.   Overall a very enjoyable staycay we had! All the staffs we encountered are so welcoming, thanks for such a great experience!

An excellent stay except we were put off by how far the car park was, and how costly the parking was(yeah I know there is valet parking but do not appreciate other's handling personal property and besides the hotels we stayed the last three months all offer free unlimited car park entry/exit ). The security at the lift lobby and having to line up before each pool session to be briefed feels like being in a prison. If not for those could have given MBS 5-stars.

Front Desk Staff saves the day,Zuma,"The booking experience online is confusing to say the least, with the array of packages that comes with varying options that makes it difficult when one is trying to book multiple rooms for the family. We ended with rooms in different towers that confuses even the front desk staff.   Even more confusing is the pre requisite to make an appointment to get a queue number to check in which wasnt made clear at the stage of booking or when you receive the booking confirmation. With three rooms to manage, I ended memorising the booking reservation codes for all three rooms because you need to key them in for every little booking or tweaks you want to make.

The pool was everything I imagine it was so beautiful and relaxing and we were really lucky with the weather. The food menu for the pool was a very reasonable price too.  Due to covid we did only get one hour pool slots a day which was very hard to book but it was actually worth it as it wasn’t too busy and we got a great bed and relaxing space.   The staff were very friendly. Thanks for Fitz for a lovely welcome in the morning for our 9.30qm pool slot.

The lunch menu was not much to write about. The dinner menu was more substantive. If you enjoy alcoholic drinks in a good setting,you will enjoy Club 55. Club 55 is the main venu for the lunch and dinner treats. If the place is full when you arrive,there are alternative venues to enjoy same food.The view on Level 55 is fantastic.

While waiting for our reservation to call, my grandmother suddenly felt dizzy and was about to fall (as she hadn’t eaten anything yet and my mum was not around). Luckily there’s a lady walk past who saw this and quickly came over to hold on to her, as I’m was unable to lift her. Both of us hold on to her, and I quickly called my mum to come over to help us.   I sincerely wish to thank that lady who came and help us. Saw her name tag as Chris. She should be one of the staff from the Giftshop (tower 2), as I saw her walked into that store after that.

Front desk Nicolette and manager kenny are super unprofessional and unhelpful. Booked 2 rooms for 4 person. Was denied connecting room as we were friends. Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room.

November Staycay,Shazwanmchaggis,"Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era.   However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained.   All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one.

A nice pool. Nothing more.,VincentRicci,"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you must visit if you come to Singapore, like a checkbox in a to-do list. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though. First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way. The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in. Because of COVID-19, you can only use the pool for one hour a day, provided you have managed to reserve a time slot, which is not always possible.  We…",3,October 2020,

Some say this is the best hotel in the world!,WellDeservedVac... T,Some say this is the best hotel in the world! .......and it may very well be.   Now internationally famous world wide from the Crazy Rich Asians movie this hotel lives up to every bit of the hype that it has. Very impressive and state of the art with some of the most one of a kind features and views of Singapore.   Definitely hands down the best pool in the world on top of the hotel and only for hotel guests. Food here is the best! But if you want to save some money you can also walk down through the lobby onto the many options at the local malls and food courts which are too some of the best in the world as well!,5,December 2019,

The staff here was super helpful and did everything that we requested for in a very minimum time. Overall this place gave us a superb experience off Singapore.,5,December 2019,

We walked over and did the thing that we were told and only to be denied registration since it is past 10pm. It is messy and awkward for our 2 guests with the way things are handled.

Since they were the same view, I obviously chose the higher floor room. No doubt the view from the bedroom of the city was spectacular, esp at night.

Towels, cups and toiletries were in plastic coverings to show they have been covered after washing/sterlising.  For breakfast, we chose to eat at Spagio.

It's not really a pool, in the sense that it's only about 80cm deep, so forget about swimming, but it serves very well to cool down and make super pictures.

Amazing break,Catherin,"The purpose of writing this review is to compliment your hotel staff for their wonder service. Thanks to your staff for making it such a comfortable stay at your hotel. I was here for the past four days and today is my last day staying with your hotel, it's such a wonderful time spent with my family and for all these days I was attended with utmost warmth. Although there has been some hiccups upon my check in but it was solve almost immediately.   I was impressed to see the prompt room service despite the strict restrictions post Covid, everything comes in individual wrappers.The room and every touchable surfaces was sanitized frequently. That's the comfort we seek when we are away from home to know that we are well protected.   Every need was catered with utmost perfection…",5,July 2020,Travelled with family
Staycation,Kelly C,"Room is clean and big. Nice view with balcony. Pool is definitely breathtaking with awesome views. Too sunny to swim in the day, took a swim and relax after 7pm, so windy and cool. Very nice of the hotel to give us a complimentary small slice of cake for our anniversary.",4,July 2020,Travelled as a couple
I want to go back,Marjorie,It was just great experience.. No words... Room spacious comfortable. Great view.. Staff sooo friendly and thank you receptionist Son.. to helpful feedback about Singapore. And of course that you must go to the hotel pool... Its a little bit expensive.. But king chilly crab rules the world..,5,September 2019,Travelled with friends
The lifeguard at the pool section was rude,Andy Ng,"So, I was in my room and I felt like taking a swim at the infinity pool located at the top of the building in marina bay sands and managed to enter in with my pass and as I was walking past 2 lifeguards, one of them screamed  ""oiiiiiiiiii"" out of nowhere and I was shocked and confused. It was pure rude of them, and I was affected throughout my whole journey because of this punk, I do not know his name but I do know he's a muslim. Please keep your staff disciplined before allowing them to come out to work in this industry, acting like hooligans, is simply downgrading your company reputation and image. I would not recommend anyone near the pool, or as a whole in marina bay sands! with those punks roaming around.",3,March 2020,
Best place to stay in Singapore,Mario M,"This hotel is an experience, not the most welcomed check in/out but this is because the entrance is throughout the shopping mall. Once you are in your room you will be amazed by the comfort and beautiful views. The infinity pool at the top is the main attraction (the pool is only available to hotel guest) and is just amazing, you can also find a couple of nice restaurants plus a cocktail bar (this available to non hotel guest).  The hotel is within walking distance to the gardens by the bay (our room was facing the gardens) and the view at night is out of this world.  Highly recommend this place!",5,July 2020,
Wonderful hotel with great pool,Ann,"Extremely clean, great service, beautiful views, great food, great architecture! This hotel is a must to visit. We enjoyed pool, jacuzzis, room living room/ tv room and bedroom. Giant room! With electric blinds etc..and views are amazing!",5,November 2019,Travelled on business
Amazing,miriamviev,"We were lucky to check in early so we could get some sleep after a long flight. Really nice service. We went for a swim straight after that, loved it! Booked this hotel mainly for the views, did not let down. It was phenomenal! ",5,December 2019,Travelled as a couple
Beautiful View of Singapore,Ng Adeline,We checked in at night and facing The Garden by The Bay. There’s were music and colorful lightings and we just watched it from our balcony. Their buffets spreads is so very impressive and we ate so much. Staff were very helpful and friendly.,5,January 2020,Travelled with friends
Stay at The Fairmont.,Annika M,"Visited Singapore twice at Marina Bay Sands. With butler service. As a single woman. Horrible. You book a table at Spago and get seated at the bar with a Vogue magazine. After several phone calls. Butler service is ridiculous. The lounge is fantastic, great staff and food!  I am sorry. Your hotel is not up to par. One thing I loved is the open buffet downstairs. Simply fantastic. Worth a visit. Your hotel is not.",2,July 2019,
"Excellent Stay, Worth the Upgrade",Abana87,"When staying at a hotel with such a reputation, its very easy to approach with a cynical perspective. However, if our stay at Marina Bay Sands showed anything, it's that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.  Upon our initial arrival in a taxi, our bags were taken off us by a member of staff, ready to be brought to our room once we had checked in. Queuing at check-in took roughly 15 minutes and even though we arrived ~3 hours before it would normally open, we were told we could head up to our Deluxe King Harbour View room. This also meant that we could access the Infinity Pool straightaway, in that blissful quieter period in between the majority of guests checking out and checking in.  I highly urge anyone staying hereto consider the Harbour View upgrades, as not only was…",5,October 2019,
"When its Singapore, its must be Marina Bay Sands",Armie S,"I had the best checked in experience in my 30 years of travelling pre covid. Upon reservation I was informed to check in at Tower 3 reception. While in line, I was asked about my reservation by a staff and after seeing my confirmation voucher we were asked to follow the staff to their check in lounge located at Tower 1. Its a little walk but worth it. The lounge is an exclusive check in with all amenities from unlimited fresh juices, coffee and bottled water. There are biscuits, pastries and candies.Wifi and a lot of beautiful orchids.  Front desk staff were very cordial and helpful. We also receive stem of flowers from the staff. It was a VIP experience indeed.   If the checked  in was an experienced, what more with the accommodation and the most coveted high top (55F) infinity…",5,September 2019,
Always exceptional,Lauren_lab90,"Second time staying at this hotel. It is the luxury of Singapore and it does not disappoint. Rooms and bathrooms are a big size. Amazing view of the gardens at night and access to the infinity pool. Had brekkie at the pool one morning and drinks at one of the rooftop bars one evening. Celebrating my mums birthday, the hotel had even organised a birthday cake to be delivered to our room.",5,March 2020,
Stayction and Chill!,Mskfan03,"Have stayed here for couple of times with friends and my partner! every time I come in I will always be amazed of how it is built, the knowledge of the architect and team is superb in building such unique and amazing building!  The pool is my favorite spot of course (i think everyone loves it), the view, the ambiance, everything is good.   Oh the room is really spacious and good for family too! Food you can find it in the building, may it be pricey or minimal range, all you need is in that one building!",4,December 2019,
Consistent Service Level,Katarina,"Impeccable service from the start to the end, been there a few times with friends & family. We're always satisfied with the experience. Not to mention, the infinity pool is definitely a great place to wind down & relax. Particularly prefer heading there at night where it's a little more quiet. A wide variety of restaurants/bar are available till late too for those who might crave a gourmet supper.",5,June 2019,
Awesome experience,CherylB0306,Had a wonderful stay at MBS. Picked a room overlooking the Gardens which didn't disappoint. Room was nicely appointed and view was great. This was our first visit to Singapore.  Definitely happy we decided to stay at MBS. MBS just felt like you were truly experiencing Singapore. Loved the rooftop bar and infinity pool. Granted the pool was busy (do it early) but it was worth the pictures and memories. And couldn't get enough of the view from the bar at night. Granted  the hotel is busy but it is a destination of its own. Also have to commend the hotel for taking steps to be safe in light of the coronavirus pandemic. As you entered the lobby everyone was thermal scanned for a fever. Also lots of hand sanitizer sitting in common areas. Other hotels did the same. Our next stop on…,4,February 2020,

Staycation on 27/28 March 2020,Yuantai,"MBS is one of the top hotels in Singapore, and the most famous, for the iconic infinity pool view.  My staycation with my wife was a wonderful experience. The service was impeccable, and the room spacious and comfortable. You can't expect anything less with a top hotel, but my oh my, they really outperformed themselves. Keep it up, team MBS!",5,March 2020,
Just stunning,Dean,"This is probably one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in, we did two full days and stayed one night and still didn’t get to see everything, the pool is everything and the light show at night in the gardens is something I will always remember, the mail and botanical gardens are incredible ",5,September 2019,
Excellent staycation made close-to-perfect,qookie,"From its signature infinity pool to the stunning architecture, this hotel takes the cake on many levels (pun unintended). With just a short air-conditioned stroll to MRT station, the whole Singapore is at your fingertips. The spacious hotel room was indeed a surprise- you can’t find any hotel room bigger than this in Singapore.   Unfortunately, the hotel doesn’t do anything for birthday celebrations. ",5,March 2020,
Short visit,lov1987,We stayed there for 1 night only to attend an event so we didn't had much time to explore the whole hotel. Great location with superb facilities. You will be amazed how many guests this hotel can accommodate everyday. They have 2 front desk counters in each side of the wing. Accessible to their MTR also there's mall next to it with a lot of restaurant choices. We get to visit their casino as well. A must visit in Singapore so I suggest you should make it worth it. Hope to be back soon. #longoverduefeedback,5,May 2019,
Great experience a must for Singapore,ANGELA,we moved here for 3 nights after spending 4 more nights in another hotel in Singapore  the line for check in looked huge but went fast and there were people there offering water and juice for the people that waited we had a room on high floor facing the gardens and we loved . the views was amazing and the location is what makes this hotel perfect on my opinion you are next to everything and walking in Singapore was lovely we did the walk to Merlion and back several times there are plenty or restaurants to choose from we did love the buffet breakfast a dinner (a little pricey but worth it) . there only bad think for us was  the roof top pool is sooo cold its impossible to enjoy a swim in it we were brave enough to get in twice one per the night and one during the day but we could…,5,November 2019,

Still the best place in Singapore,PD1967,"I travel to Asia a lot for business and always end up staying a few night in Singapore, I always tell myself that i'll try another hotel next time i'm here but for some reason i always end up back at The Marina Bay,  The Staff are so friendly and service is beyond what you would expect for a large hotel of this stature. The hotel is located right next to the metro stations where you can easily get around, the gardens by the bay is just across the street where they offer a daily light show which i highly recommend anyone to have a look.   As for the best pool in the world, its truly is a great place to swim up and enjoy the infinity pool with a great cocktail.",5,January 2020,

The room, 50th floor city view king suite was gorgeous.  After quickly getting settled I headed to the 57th floor infinity pool overlooking the city, the pool is huge, beautiful, and the staff are there for your every want.   The hotel also has a shopping mall attached that is huge, has all the great shops and even more restaurants by chefs like Gordon Ramsey, Dan Boloud, Wolfgang Puck etc.  There are 2 rooftop restaurants, Ce La Vi and Loma, both excellent and Ce La Vi bar becomes a night club after 8PM with a live DJ.  I could go on and on,  I WILL definitely be back.",5,March 2020,
No way would I stay here!,KLPLeeds,"We recently stayed in Singapore and decided to visit Marina Bay for a drink (and a nosy) we had wanted to book to stay here, although didn’t as thought it seemed pricey. Thank God we didn’t!! It is terrible. The reception area is huge, but full of people (not sure if they are hotel guests of people having a nosey) there are so many people it is like being in a busy shopping centre, nothing nice or relaxing about it at all. It does not look like a grand reception, just a very busy place. We looked in a few of the shops (mainly selling magnets etc) then just walked straight into the guest lift which took you to the guest rooms (not one person questioned this) we then reached the level where the bar was, which was great as we wanted a drink. The bar seems very run down and shabby,…",1,March 2020,
Great vibe,Kurt,"The “reception” is the entrance to the mall, there’s a lot of people there and it’s busy and not so welcoming. The rooms are designed well and comfortable. Gym is top notch, has everything. The pool is good for a photo but it gets a little busy.",3,September 2019,
Rooftop Pool Swim!,TORN1,Spent five nights in Singapore to acclimatize to jetlag and flight arrival and departure times. Couldn’t justify 5 nights here due to the price but did opt for two nights. We were in a family room which was well appointed and quite spacious. Early check in without a problem. Got a room fridge delivered to store our alcohol and beverages as too pricey from the minibar. Great location. Ate at the Marvel restaurant for the black bunned Batman burger. Not bad.   The rooftop pool was worth the price of the rooms. Spent many hours lounging in the sun and soaking in the pool and hot tubs.,4,February 2020,
Bucket list ticked,Pauline Crespo Estaris,"Marina Bay Sands is in our bucket list and we happily ticked it off last December 2019! We enjoyed our stay although we have to get two rooms since we are five in the family! From Changi Airport, wete fetched by the MBS private limousine. We were lucky we didnt queue - we, were checked in in a jiffy! Thanks to the ever efficient Front Office Premium Services. We were billeted at the 44th floor overlooking the Gardens by the Bay and the view was definitely spectacular especially at night! We got two interconnected rooms and we enjoyed the amenities that they provided us. Of course, we never missed swimming at theur iconic infinity pool at the 57th floor although the water was icy cold late in the afternoon and at night! As a whole our stay at MBS was once in a lifetime experience…",5,December 2019,
Well worth it,Gail154,We had the most amazing stay here! The hotel is amazing and well worth a stay. We were fortunate in getting an upgrade on arrival and stayed in room 5015 which has the most amazing views of the garden and marina. We also had breakfast included which was delicious. Due to the time of visit mid Covid19 I must say the hotel had it spot on and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly giving the circumstances. Hats of to you all you are all amazing!,5,March 2020,
TOP of the world and Singapore!,Landy - I Live to Eat,Iconic!  Popular despite it’s $300 -800 room rate.  Good service.   Incredible infinity pool for unforgettable photos!

Stay  here!,momandktravel,"Everyone needs to stay here at least once in their life! Get a high floor with a view, it is really worth it. The pool is really nice although it has a spring break vibe. Service was nice and friendly throughout the hotel. The hotel is huge and kind of feels like Las Vegas, actually there is a casino connected. There is also a great mall and it is wonderful to be able to walk around the gardens and see the light show from your room at night.  My room was nice, comfortable bed and nice bathroom.",5,February 2020,
Wonderful Stay everyone so nice,Chef Jimmy C,We arrived shortly before they closed down Singapore We wish them all the best.

February Stay,Mfrance,"I stayed here early February for work, due to my work i had to travel and stay at hotels, this hotel has good product. My opinion, lacks human touch, i didn't feel the passion to help, and in fact i would say robotic.  This hotel will be top class hotel if they master the human portion of the business. Also, do focus on maintenance and housekeeping.",3,February 2020,
Fab Feb Visit,Pinelakemo,"I was there during mid Feb and was relieved about the efforts the hotel was taking to protect guests from the Coronavirus.  They were taking temperatures of everyone coming in and out of the hotel.  The hotel wasn't full which was also a relief, I stayed in one of the top floors and was delighted by the huge room, amenities and spectacular view.  I thought staying there was worth the price tag, the pool is a must do.  I also greatly appreciated how easy it was to walk to Gardens by the Bay which was a great way to spend a day.  The view from the rooftop restaurant is amazing but candidly Ce la Vie disappointed in the food and drink category; simply not worth the outrageous price tag.  The staff at the hotel is wonderful.  I would stay again.",4,February 2020,
Amazing Experience and Value For Money,DanlelR,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 1 night. Staying on the 53rd floor with amazing views of the Gardens By The Bay. The room was huge and very lavish. The room was equipped with Hermes amenities which was a real treat   Dining at Rise restaurant was delightful. You would expect for a buffet to have food or average quality. However, this was not the case. The food tasted fresh and well prepared. Chefs were seen inspected the food frequently and service staff were enduring that the buffet line were in clean and tip top condition. Service was friendly and quick.   I would like to give a shout out to Suresh from the reception who made my stay in the Marina Bay Sands amazing!",5,March 2020,
Superb😍,Val B,"Have just spent 2 glorious days at this hotel. We could not praise this hotel enough, it’s magnificent. Everything about it is wonderful.

Awesome,TallPaulLondon,"Stayed here for three nights in March. Although this was during the Corona Virus outbreak we feel totally safe with checkpoints at the entrance to the hotel taking our temperatures and all the guests.  The hotel is large with over 2500 rooms, however everyone at the hotel made you feel special and your custom was very much appreciated. The rooms are large with all the facilities you would expect of a five star hotel. The views out of the rooms are either towards the city skyline or Gardens in the Bay, both sets of views are awesome.  The swimming pool and roof top bar are amazing and the views are phenomenal.

Amazing hotel,Karin H,"First time in Singapore and I just had to splurge on this hotel. It was only supposed to be for one night but our flights got changed so we ended up staying an extra night. The check in process was really quick and simple. Our taxi from the airport dropped us off at tower three and that's where we checked in, no line! We got upgraded to a higher floor and a kingsize bed (instead of the two twin beds that were the only thing available when we initially booked). We booked a garden room and stayed on the 43rd floor. The room was excellent, the bed super comfy and the views from the balcony were insane!   You need a keycard for each person to access the rooftop pool and skydeck. There are pool towels by the pool area so you don't need to bring any with you. Other people were wearing…",5,February 2020,

We would never dream of experiencing such an amazing stay because of him ! ",5,March 2020,
Excellent experience,Jolly traveler,"The rooms are very well maintained, spacious and came with a huge balcony facing the Gardens, sea view. The bathroom and facilities were excellent.

Staycation at MBS,Sam T,Very satisfied with the amenities in the hotel. The infinity swimming pool at roof top is breathtaking. My children were very happy to stay there.

Bayfront MRT station is just below the hotel which makes it very accessible to many places of interest in town.,5,March 2020,
Spectacular,norphano,"What a site. I did not actually stay at the hotel so I can't comment on the rooms but this made many Vegas hotels of similar style look like peanuts. The grounds and facilities are amazing, the rooftop is pretty unbelievable, many restaurants to eat at as well. It is pricey, but this is a one off for many people to either visit or stay. Wish I had more time to explore it!",5,November 2019,
Amazing night,iris wu,the swimming pool is fantastic! the view from the top is excellent for the fireworks at 10 p.m at night. walking distance to the garden by the bay.

It was worth it!!,doryf3390,"It’s not a cheap hotel and I think for a lot of people, it’s a one off, but i’m now not sure I can stay anywhere else in Singapore!   Our room looked out over the Gardens by Bay which was wonderful and of course the infinity pool was everything we hoped it would be. We didn’t realise how long the opening hours were ( 06:00-23:00 ) so we visited the pool 3 times on a one night stay just for the novelty of a 10pm and 7am swim!  We dropped our bags off at the hotel around 10am and was pleasantly surprised to be checked in early, though with Corona Virus the hotel was significantly quieter than usual but still very much appreciated.  The one sour point was we popped up to Lavo, the rooftop bar and restaurant, for a cocktail before heading out for dinner. All the tables with stools…",5,March 2020,
Had to be done,Sand0312,We didn’t stay at the hotel but visited the viewing deck. I haven’t got a great head for heights but it had to be done! The views were fabulous and I was fine as long as I stayed back from the edge!! My husband took the photos!,5,March 2020,

Great stay overall. Very clean, Spacious bathroom, Amazing views, and of course, the  infinity pool. Room: We stayed in a Premier Sky View room. Very clean and views offered were amazing! Our housekeeper (Zi chuang) was amazing during our stay! A different animal everyday on a neatly made bed was a very nice touch.  Elevators to rooms: We were on a higher floor. Not more than a few seconds wait for an elevator.  Infinity Pool: Amazing, but be mindful of the crowds in the afternoon and evening hours. Prime time seemed to be around 4PM (16:00). Service was very attentive. The difficult part was finding a pool chair.  Location: You are right…",5,January 2020,
ANOTHER ITEM ON BUCKET LIST TICKED OFF,SIAN B,"One night/ two day stay purely so I could swim in the pool. Did not disappoint. Check in was prompt and efficient, upgraded to Orchid suite on 52nd floor. The room plus views over the gardens were spectacular. Complimentary access to club lounge on 55 floor where a good range of drinks and snacks were on offer. The pool has the wow factor as expected with great service on offer. Will definitely return. Nothing too much trouble",5,March 2020,
Marina Bay Sands - A Flavour to our Honeymoon Trip,Manik,I have chosen to stay in Marina Bay sands for my Honeymoon Trip. The Hotel is really a iconic place to stay once in the lifetime. The infinity pool experience is something which can just be felt. All the staff members are very courteous. The font desk guy Jacky at the reception offered us complimentary room upgrade and decoration. Ryan lifeguard at the pool also gave his precious time to us and clicked our pictures. Everything in the hotel was excellent. Thank you MBS.,5,February 2020,
Lovely staycation,addar,"Amidst covid-19 with all the travel restrictions, we opted for a staycation at MBS. Our room faces Garden by the Bay and hence we've a spectacular views. The twin room is spacious, making it really comfortable for my 2 big girls and me. The infinity pool was generally quite crowded be it day or night, but it's still worth going to enjoy a good view of the city. No complimentary parking but valet parking is about $13 for 24h with multiple entry. So it's not that expensive is you consider how much you've to pay normally. Nice hotel to check-in to once a while to be a local tourist.",4,March 2020,
Unique Hotel and special experience in the heart of Singapore!,Kinga and Benedikt,"Very nice hotel with unbelievable kind staff.

A weekend to remember!,Georgia,"Marina Bay Sands was such an amazing experience and I am so glad we did it. We had a deluxe room on the 44th floor and it was amazing. The bed was comfy, spacious and had generous facilities. We absolutely loved the machine operated curtains - we would lie in bed and look at the Singapore skyline and then press the button when we were ready for bed.  The service was excellent - although incredibly apparent that they were over servicing in return for tip which made it slightly disingenuous and uncomfortable (we always tipped the staff). Room service drinks are eye-wateringly expensive, but to be expected. We had room service breakfast one day which was divine. We ordered for 9am - my boyfriend went downstairs at 8.45am to the shop and came back up at 8.58am to find the staff…",4,March 2020,
Fantastic pool experience,Morten P,"This hotel is all about the rooftop pool, but it is so worth it!  The rooms are nice and big. Choose a room facing the city and above 10th floor. We stayed in a premiere room which was huge and with a giant bathroom. The breakfast at the top floor was also fantastic. The hotel is huge and commercial but it doesn't matter to us.",5,March 2020,
Marina Bay Sands 5*,Donna Marie,"I cannot put into words how special this place is. We spent our last 3 days here after a month long trip travelling around Australia. It was the perfect end to such an amazing trip. We planned this stay as part of our anniversary and I cannot thank the team at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel enough. Particularly Allie and Joanne you made our Anniversary so special. We was surprised with airport transfers, wine, cake, cocktails by the amazing pool and a beautiful box of hand crafted chocolates as well as an upgrade on our room. You really went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. We will definitely be back. Thank you once again. Danny & Donna",5,March 2020,

Great views!,TressieSurrey,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of a 30th anniversary trip and seeing the hotel as we approached from the airport, was exciting - it is spectacular and very imposing. The staff are efficient and pleasant but you are aware that it is a big hotel and they are busy. Not surprisingly, the best thing about this hotel are the views. We stayed in a Premier Sky View room overlooking the bay and I never tired of the view. The view from the pool is also spectacular but it can be a little busy up there. We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant up by the pool each day. One of our favourite things in Singapore was the night time light show in Super Tree Grove which is very close to the hotel and worth seeing. A great place for a first stay in Singapore but if we return, we will go for a…",5,November 2019,
Amazing hotel but maybe needs a little more luxury for price,Selina K,The pool is worth staying the night as you can only use the pool when staying in the room.  We we were lucky to be upgraded to a room with a  better view which was good as I think the wow factor would of been lost on the lower floors. There is an element of  nit picking to this as it is a 5* hotel which I think is mainly based on its pool an view. The room are a very good size and bath room is really good.  For the rooms to be better they would need coffee machines in the room not instant and a kettle. Just a few luxuries missing for the price tag. But still had a very pleasant stay. Breakfast was average,4,February 2020,
Worth the extra splurge!,panda26,"First and foremost, need to mention this...one of the hotel staff members saw 3 adults with a boatload of luggage and a slightly cranky toddler in a stroller about to get into a very long line to check in, and immediately asked us to follow him.  He led us to a room tucked in back of the main registration desk where we were assisted immediately with our room reservations.  This was a wonderful gesture assisting a family where at times it can be difficult to go through registration or stand in line with young fussy children.  My husband thanked him for recognizing our situation after we got our rooms.  Stayed in Tower 1.  Great layout, knockout views from the 42nd floor, comfortable and clean.  Tried out fitness center in Tower 2, very nice and spacious!  The Shoppes adjacent to…",5,February 2020,
Missing Stash of Money,BubblesEito,"Recently, stayed at tower 3 of the hotel.  Stay was fantastic but the response for reported lost and found is slow. They were polite and everything. But obviously anxious as in all my hotel stays I had nothing lost , misplaced or taken. Even though I had taken utmost care of my valuables, somehow it has gone missing. I am not pointing fingers at any party. But it is indeed painful.",3,March 2020,
A must when staying in Singapure,Carina Ferreira,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands in November 2018 and it was a great experience. Had the luck of having a high floor room facing the Gardens by the bay which has balcony and sunrise views. We were still jet lagged so we watched the sunset at the roof top jacuzzi and it’s like stoping in time on how beautiful it is. Infinity pool is of course amazing. The only downsize that I would say is the fact that the hotel is so big that we never interact with staff, asking if the stay is going well etc and had to queue for check in, however the receptionists compensate by personalising the checkin more than usual so it’s a good balance. Would definitely return",5,April 2019,
Amazing place to stay,SammiSunni,"Everything about this location is decadent.  The rooms, views, rooftop, pool, spa, shopping and eataries.  The best part was the cafeteria in the sub level.  Everything was reasonably rpiced.  I had a garden view room and the views were specatular.  Definitely recommend staying here.  only downside is the infinity pool can get very crowded.  I recommend going VERY early like 5am/6am early if you want good pics.",5,November 2019,
Big rooms with fantastic views,Sam,"Did a short staycation with my family due to travel plans all disrupted by Covid-19. This is the hotel all the tourist will see on TV due to the iconic infinity pool.   The rooms we had was really big and spacious. It had a great view overlooking gardens by the bay and my young son really enjoys the view.   The mall itself has alot of high end goods but to us is not the best place to shop. Also, there are not alot of local fares within walking distance of the hotel, so if you want to have a more 'Singaporean' experience, this is not the hotel for you.   The only gripe i have is that check out time is strictly 11am. If they can make it to 12pm, i think it will enhance the overall experience and give us more time to enjoy the facilities better",4,March 2020,
Weekend of luxury,markofhants,"Stayed here for a weekend and WOW, fabulous hotel, great food (very good value in the food court in the basement) . and views to die for - great service, lovely drinks and just standing staring out of our window was perfect (40th Floor). Infinity pool beautifully clean, stunning vistas over the city and the harbour.  Spacious rooms with floor to ceiling windows (not for the faint hearted)  Wonderful and memorable experience",5,February 2020,
Has Everything One Could Want,CJ W,"I remember watching the construction of MBS from another property. It's an amazing property.  Great views, beautiful rooms, excellent club lounge, most extraordinary infinity pool anywhere and great restaurants.  And that's all before you cross to the adjacent mall with casino, shopping, gondola ride, etc,  Only downside is the impersonal nature that comes with a gigantic property.",4,November 2019,
Come sail away...,NikaNumber1,"This is such a cool iconic building and structure, almost as cool as the sail building or the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai. This literally looks like a boat on top of 3 buildings.   It’s a hotels and casino. Riding the Singapore flyer allows you some cool views of this intriguing building up close and more personal.   The interior is just as cool. This and the Gardens By The Bay are what come to mind when I think of Singapore. ",4,March 2020,
Skydeck views,MerylKendall,"My husband prebooked our tickets to the Skydeck online. We didn't book a time slot but had tickets valid for the whole day as we were visiting Singapore from a cruise ship and weren't sure what time we would be able to get there. When we arrived it wasn't busy so we were able to go up straight away. We hadn't realised the Skydeck was quite a small area at one end of the top of the building, but still enjoyed our visit nonetheless. We had the most wonderful views over Singapore and the surrounding areas. There is a small cafe on the Skydeck so we had a coffee each which were quite reasonably priced. Where the top is curved we could just see the famous infinity pool area which is only open to hotel guests. There is a small souvenir shop on the ground floor.",4,February 2020,
Amazing place to stay,Ray B,"We had a great time at Marina Bay Sands. It had everything within walking distance such as - shops, restaurants, casino, entertainment. We had a room with sights overlooking gardens that had a light show every night which was awesome. Highly recommended.",5,September 2019,
"Outstanding experience, and something for everyone.",andreacI9470GX,"Of course the architecture is stunning, but it's the staff that I want to commend.  Management is superb, and the training must be rigorous.  We were treated like VIPs.  What a great resort.  We will return.",5,February 2020,
Tourist Trap,Matthew C,My family of four arrived excited to stay in this amazing structure. Good service on check in clean rooms. Unfortunately that’s it! No spots at the pool due to selling tickets to get in & no paying guest priorities. Then went back later to the rooftop for drinks only to be told at least 20 min wait for a drink. People sleeping on pool deck chairs in the morning to get a spot!! Over rated tourist trap!,2,April 2019,
Unforgettable Stay,Cloyd,"It’s a great place to unwind and relax. Room was big and the view from our room was nice. Infinity pool view was breathtaking. Staff were kind, polite and cheerful especially Dennis and Evangela. They give us warm service while we enjoy the view of the city on the pool side.",5,February 2020,
Top of the world,Raymond H,"We arrived as the virus has been affecting tourism, got an up grade to a suite for not much more as the hotel is very quiet. Staff are professional, polite and here to help. They appreciate us being there especially as it is so quiet. Pool was amazing, food great, service top notch as you would expect in this hotel. It is an iconic place and well worth a stay if you can .. if too expensive then do the visit it is worth it for the photos..",5,March 2020,
A modern city with a lot of history,Dutchkiwi75,"A must see.  Such a phenomenal site seeing the hotel. Also the Merlion has been nicely placed here. There are plenty of places to eat or drink, and everyone will find something to there liking.  Great nightlife.  Singapore is a safe city to go late in the evening.",5,September 2019,
Not impressed,grybuKaras,Been there 2012 and it had wow factor! So easy to compare for me. Now nothing special except pool. Breakfast could be better quality. Can't​ do late check out and use pool. No more airport transfer. Not everything is clean and looks like it need renovation.,4,March 2020,
High class hotel but poor service,Arvs,"We stayed here for 1 night in November 2019 solely to experience the infinity pool. The pool is one to tick off the bucket list and the view is much better at night. We also went to the rooftop club/bar (c'est la vi) which again was another great experience (free entry as we were guests of the hotel). The most disappointing aspect for us was the poor customer service. It seems that the best of service is reserved for their VIP guests with the level of service for all other guests being well below our expectation or even what you could expect at other hotels on par. In the early hours of the morning we woke up to drilling in the room above us and there was no sense of urgency to resolve the matter, re-affirming the customer service experience or lack thereof. The infinity pool is…",3,November 2019,
Definitely place to stay in Singapore.,Mateo McCloskey,"The hotel is always very busy, people everywhere and you have to wait in a line for swimming pool and breakfast. But it's a must stay anyway! Amazing view from the swimming pool and actually I believe from all the rooms without paying extra. Amazing breakfast, top quality food! Yum yum yum. I can return just for that. Feel of luxury is present, high quality customer service and friendly staff, very tidy and clean.",5,November 2019,
SEEING IS BELIEVING,Philip B,"A marvellous feat of engineering.The Marina Bay Sands hotel is totally mesmerising. The size and scale of the thing simply takes your breath away. Inside as you'd expect,is  immaculate . Looks great lit up at night too !",5,February 2020,
Best Experience!!! Made our trip to Singapore!!!,Daniel F,"It was my wife and my first time visiting Southeast Asia and our first stop was Marina Bay Sands. Obviously we heard about the hype via television shows and social media, but what we were not expecting was the excellent service and treatment we received. From the very start, Shawn Chin initiates assistance with coordinating our pickup from the airport. We were greeted at the hotel by Allie Seo who got us our room early with all the information about the hotel. She really made us feel at home. We were so touched I asked if they had availability on our return trip back to Singapore, and she coordinated and worked to secure us a room and get us booked up. We were originally supposed to stay somewhere else but we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to be with MBS again. The facilities…",5,March 2020,
ONE OF A KIND,Dan L,"Stayed at the MBS for 3 nights in late February.  Our stay was exceptional, undoubtedly enhanced by a upgrade to Premier Room due to a wedding anniversary.  The hotel is immaculate.  Our room was spacious, with fantastic views from the 44th floor.Dined at LAVO where the food and service were excellent. The infinity pool provides impressive views of the city.  This is Singapore so be prepared to dish out a few dollars more for everything.  MBS, a rewarding and unique experience in a one of a kind building.",5,February 2020,
Very nice hotel,Nuengrothai L,"It is my dream hotel in Singapore Marina Bay Sand,We stay there for 2 night , infinity pool very nice and so amazing. I enjoy and happy to stay there ,also buffet is good ,everything was perfect......",5,February 2020,
Amazing!!,EmmaK,"We stayed here for only one night, upgraded form a deluxe room to an Orchid suite, from the check in until check our, staff were amazing. The view was spectacular form the room and also from the pool. Although we only spent 5 mins in it as they came to clean it and we had dinner booked so couldn’t wait. We will be back again! ",5,February 2020,
If you want to sleep in a mall...,SafaTravla,"If you want to sleep in a mall with a cold ambiance and rude staff look no further than Marina Bay Sands...no one will greet you when you arrive and if you want a computer to check you out when you leave you'll have found the right place. Also, you too can have an over priced entry (incl drink) to a rooftop bar that allows you to experience social segregation at its finest but don't dispare - when you finally get to the top you get to find out that the entry fee, that ""includes a drink"", doesn't actually cover TAX and SERVICE CHARGES but don't fret the irritable staff will be happy to not explain this to you at any point of your stay, just look for front of house ""guest liason"" named Nas for no extra info. Happy Travels",1,February 2020,
Amazing stay!!,Greyson L,"Check in by Mr Saiful was smooth, great service delivered! Thank you to Mr Ryan lifeguard for the amazing picture and your service! And lastly thank you Ms Alice for the smooth check out! Will definitely come back again!",5,March 2020,
Beautiful Marina Bay Sands,Suzie Shopper,"We stayed 2 nights before going on a cruise.This hotel is very large and beautiful,with nice attention to detail. We had pre paid our stay and the only Complaint I would have is upon check in the clerk strongly urged a upgrade and when we said no he seemed a bit short. An extra 200$ per night,no thanks.The room was clean staff friendly. The roof top pool is like no other! It is expensive to stay here however we did enjoy our stay.",4,February 2020,
Marina Bay Sands Singapore,Faye F,"Simply divine accommodation, fantastic service, staff and facilities.  The infinity pool is amazing.  The Gardens by the Bay, Shopping Mall with high end fashion and surrounds are beautiful.  A treat for anyone visiting Singapore.",5,July 2019,
Beautiful hotel,MMLM,"Stayed at MBS for 3 nights at the Garden View Room/Suite. I picked it since it looked over the Gardens by the bay. Check in- a little slow, not a lot of people and took a while,but they gave us some ice cream while waiting. The entry was amazing, and the lobby smelled good, staff was courteous. The hotel room, perfect!. But why the minus star-the coffee in the room was instant! Why? For the rate I expected brewed coffee or Nespresso. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and the ones that had instant were the quick airport ones or 2 or 3 stars. My husband who ""never"" complains, well did, for the first time. A month later,it still bothered him, out of the blue he would say why did MBS not have Nespresso. I have to remind him the mall coffees were good, and the food court too.…",4,February 2020,
Will go back!,daTravelGal,"Just like everything else in Singapore, this hotel is very nice and worth staying in! We visited during the New Year and it was amazing experience! From beautiful suite with city views (highly recommended), to the fireworks, rooftop pool, great food... I can go on and on...  The spa, which I highly recommend, is an experience on its own. Service at its best!",4,January 2020,
Didn’t Disappoint,Wurz1,Wow. Definitely get a wow here! Checked in a bit early - reception said they’d email as soon as the room was ready but never did - has to go back later and ask again. City view suite 4750 - stunning is the only word necessary! Expensive hotel (but you know that when you book - for price of room would have expected biscuits and other mini bar items to be included. Expensive city - VERY! Staff great and friendly. WiFi - 3 star.  Sophisticated? I’d say ‘mass sophisticated’ as it is a big place so you don’t get any personal feeling special vibe. Stayed 4 nights and would go back but would probably stay just for a couple of nights and try somewhere else like Raffles as well.,5,September 2019,
"""ONE FOR THE BUCKET LIST""",Paul B,"We stayed here last week as part of our anniversary trip to Singapore, the hotel was under construction when we were last in the city , now an icon for travelers due to the ambitious design  of this hotel , Singapore welcomes thousands of tourists eager to see , stay and experience Marina BAY Sands hotel . Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly staff at reception , we were upgraded to a suite on the 30th floor facing the city , WOW WOW WOW !!!!!! We were in TOWER 2 , a superior suite, overlooking the city ,  This allowed us to swim in the ""POOL"" as only guests may , what a view from level 57 overlooking the ""CBD "" bay area , hotels , Clark quay etc . on th exposit side of the pool is a garden terrace where one can view the Marina bay Gardens , light show , and harbor . truly…",5,February 2020,
And expensive not so nice journey to the top,Howard L,"I truly was more impressed with Marina Bay Sands towers from ground level than I was from the top. The vast majority of the area is reserved for hotel guests and that small portion where visitors could go was limited.  I was hoping for a 360° , Unfortunately I did not get it.",3,February 2020,
Landmark but worth the money to stay?,wei,Infinity Pool is overcrowded. It’s a great place for shopping and dining but the the room facility is not that good. I think mostly too many guests stay lack of well maintenance. Personally I won’t suggest stay here but worth to visit the place.,3,January 2020,
My tick of my bucket list having a beer at the roof top bar,Sipke vink,"Was a dream of me to go on top of the marina sands bay hotel and having a beer and enjoining the beautiful view , you pay 23 $ to go up you get a voucher of the the 23 $ what you can spend on drinks a pretty good deal the view is beautiful but very busy very hard to get a table and get serviced but all worth it",4,February 2020,
Fantastic stay and Team,LTboxTV,"Stayed for 2 nights last weekend.  Arrived at about 430pm on a Saturday to check in, slight Q at the check in counter which was reasonable for a 2500 room hotel.  Had waited for about 10-15 minutes til it was our turn, while in line I was pleasantly surprised the staff was handing out fruit punch and little ice cream cones, i guess it was their way of saying thank you for your patience :) My wife joined me shortly after in the Q and missed out on the ice cream cone as the attendant had passed me already.  Mr David Cheng who was i guess, a lobby ambassador had seen this and proactively went to his colleague an taken a couple cones and gave it to my wife and other guests who had missed out on it.  He even had came back to us and when we finished our ice cream to take the wrappers…",5,February 2020,
close your mouth,georgetaxi,Amazing hotel in stunning Singapore. you can shop till you drop in the hotel or take a boat trip but the magic happens up up up ....head to the observation deck which offers an impresive view of gardens of the bay,5,February 2020,
Best breakfast in the world,Pete Tooth,"Loved staying at the sands, great location close to the gardens shopping restaurants ect. But the breakfast was the best ever.Ive traveled to over 80 countries always 5 star but this was by far the best.The rooftop pool is amazing and would stay here again",5,March 2019,
Nice hotel but a bit crazy!,Lisa_LTN,"MBS is a lovely but very busy hotel.  It is not exactly a place for a peaceful, relaxing stay but we had stunning views from our room (we even had a small balcony which I wasn't expecting) and we absolutely loved spending time in the infinity pool.  Whilst the pool was always quite busy it wasn't as hectic as I expected it to be and we always managed to find sunbeds and had enough space to enjoy the pool and the views from it.  There is a fantastic selection of restaurants.  We had a lovely dinner at Adrift and really enjoyed our breakfast at Rise.  Overall, a nice place to spend a couple of nights even if it is just to try out the infinity pool!",4,February 2020,
Great Housekeeping Service,schutz1234,"Had a wonderful stay at MBS recently, great amenities, service etc. Not to mention, Bao Qian, the dedicated housekeeping staff for our room, ensured that our room’s cleanliness was in top condition and went the extra mile to meet our needs.",5,February 2020,
A dream come True,lamb,"One of my favorite hotels to stay in when in Singapore. The service is always great and it’s very convenient. Very clean, and great service. And what I like most is that the hotel is big but service is quick so you don’t get to feel that the hotel has a lot of people staying at a time.",5,December 2019,
Nice pool,Beaniee,"We stayed 2 nights in MBS. Checked in was fast  as only 3 people in front of me ( I checked in on Saturday around 5.30pm ). Staffs are friendly.  Room is in good size with balcony overlooking to garden by the bay, Singapore flier and marina barrage. Bed is comfy and room temperature is easy to adjust.   We went to the sky deck but didn’t swim in the infinity pool. It’s very relaxing there. Lots of foreigners there and not many Singaporean guests there. We felt that we re not in Singapore.   Overall, It’s nice experience. We will  stay here again if there is promotion ;)  Today (23Feb Sun) I went MBS hotel lobby to meet friends and the queue at 3.20pm was super long. Maybe 30-40 ppl. It may take more than 45 mins to check in. Unbelievable..... just be prepared. ",4,February 2020,
Disappointed and Upset,Catherine,I have to say I expected much more given the price paid. I've stayed at much nicer hotels for much less cost. There was always a wait at the lobby and for the elevator which was uncomfortably crowded. There was limited pool access while we were there and I didn't find the rooms to be above and beyond what one would expect for a decent hotel. I understand the hotel is busy and popular and some of this may be out of the hotels hands but what really made my stay disappointing was the way we were treated by management. We felt unwelcome and I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. It feels poorly managed and they are relying on their prestige rather than continuing to improve. The front end staff was welcoming and friendly though.,2,January 2020,
3 nights in paradise,Ianmcgregor,"Amazing hotel and staff. We had a city view room with access to club facility.  I  cannot praise this enough and if you can, upgrade to this option. It provided afternoon tea and drinks including champagne and canapés at night - you won’t need dinner.  Service from all staff was superb.  Only one very slight negative was that there was no real dress code in the club lounge.  Would have liked to see a long trousers, no shorts type policy.  If you can book more than one day to get the full Marina Bay experience. Superb hotel",5,February 2020,
Among the BEST hotel in singapore unlike others,chephrenchua,"The check-in was a breeze, in fact, was served ice-cream while waiting, the check-in staff ""MARK"" was his name, was very courteous, cater to all my request and provides excellent experience. We got the high floor and the view is FANTASTIC! Bay view you get to see musical fountain in the evening, and beautiful city night view. Sea view makes you feel like you're staying by the seaside. The room is HUGE for singapore size, as big as the RWSentosa Equarius hotel, and Nespresso coffee machine was provided, fully stocked fridge and a sofa for relaxing and enjoying the large window view. The best part of the hotel is the swimming, first time I use the pool 4 times in 2 days, mainly to dip and enjoying the view towards the city. Had lunch at LAVO restaurants, don't miss the Truffle…",5,February 2020,
Awesome Staycation,Rowie,"It’s a great place to relax, room was big and the view is fantastic (it’s a garden view). The pool is amazing and staff were so accommodating and kind. Upon entry we were greeted by Dennis and Catherine they were sincere and cheerful. Dennis assist us on where is the best spot to take photo and where to get the things we need to enjoy this amazing pool. We’ll surely recommend this hotel. Great place and service. ❤️",5,February 2020,
Chaotically crowded,Tracey,"When you are paying top dollar, you expect something extra special. You don’t expect a crowded foyer with tourists taking photos, you don’t expect to wait over 20 minutes just to get to the front of the queue to check in.  Rooms were large (slightly dated). I know this this is is an iconic hotel, but I get the feeling they are just relying on this too much.  They could really take this place to the next level if they wanted to, but I just feel right now, they don’t need to, as there is just so much interest in the place regardless.",3,February 2020,
Too crowded but nice!,JohnSing,"They lost me with the over-crowding. If you are after more exclusivity this is not the hotel for you. Nice to have a drink on the rooftop. Sensation scenery! Amazing pool area but again, too over-crowded!",3,December 2019,
Magnificent view from the infinity pool,Andy T,"Huge and very busy hotel but rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Magnet for tourists so you don't go anywhere fast on the ground floor! The gym is OK and despite being comparatively small for such a large hotel, never seems to be crowded. The infinity pool is spectacular and whilst I'm not a huge fan of all the beds being next to each other in a long line you can forgive that with magnificent views, all pretty cool. Food delivered to your bed is very good too, as are the cocktails and fairly reasonably priced given the situation!!",4,November 2019,
Awesome hotel,Thusha,"awesome hotel with the infinity pool the highlight of my stay, most definitely be back soon :) room was big and spacious, bed and pillows was soft and to my liking and most definitely had a good night's sleep",5,February 2020,
Fantastic experience,Lionel O,"Fabulous place. Clean, beautiful, big rooms, great beds, gobsmacking view, outstanding services.  Pool is fantastic but victim of it's popularity. Can be crowded at once. Recommand to visit the pool before 3pm and in week. Week end afternoon is very crowdy.  ",5,February 2020,
Nice view from hotel room and pool,Andrew,"We stayed in a premier room which was very spacious in both the sleeping and washing areas. The toilet cubicle, large shower cubicle and soaking tub were all separate. There were also two wash basins which was nice. We requested for a room with two beds and were therefore a little surprised that even though the room was large enough to accommodate two queen-sized beds, this was not the case. The room provided a very nice unobstructed view of the area outside because the window consisted of a huge glass panel. The popular infinity pool on the 57th storey was a good spot to relax with many deck chairs around and a dip in the pool allows one to snap pics with an unparalleled view of the city all around the hotel. A must for those who love posting selfies on your social media…",4,February 2020,
OVER RATED,Sue R,"We stayed for Chinese new year. Light show is great and we watched the fireworks from the infinity pool. Room was average. Tea or coffee was only enough for one cup each.No milk just creamer and hardly enough. The robes were a ladies size 14 at best. No good for men at all.For $1000 for one night was an over rated rip off. We were given a double room when we had paid for 3 people. They had to bring in a roll away bed. Which reduced the floor space,A non smoking hotel but the people below us were smoking on the balcony, Plenty of other places to stay at that are much nicer, Save your money",3,January 2020,
"Really nice hotel, great service, awkward to navigate ",PeteDempsey,We stayed 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands resort for our first trip to Singapore. The hotel lived up to expectations in terms of excellent service in a stunning location.   If you intend to stay here it is well worth paying extra with your room to be able to access everything this hotel has to offer including the Club 55 lounge with evening drinks and nibbles where everything from top quality champagne to soft drinks is flowing for 2 hours each evening.   The pool is amazing with its city views. There are a number of roof top bars which again have amazing views at night.   As an F1 fan we could see a part of the F1 track which I took advantage of having a walk on as it is a street circuit.   Drinks are very pricy though so be prepared to spend a lot of you like a drink outside…,4,February 2020,
Easiest five star review,Kyle Ciulla,"Wow one of the most known hotel in the world really lives up to its name! The staff was very accommodating, and my room was in tip top shape. The pool alone is worth every single dollar I paid! Overall great location, great scenery, and great experience!",5,January 2020,
Simply breathtaking!,Mrs M,Special mention to Nikki at check in desk. She was a superstar and made us feel very special. Thank you!!! Views are absolutely amazing. Time on 57th floor pool and viewing area at any time is stunning.  Our room was very spacious! Had everything you could want.  Clean. Loved it.  For us it was a once in a lifetime experience we will never forget.,5,February 2020,
"Amazing experience , what a view, great hospitality ",David S,"Just wrapped up a 3-night stay with my family.  We stayed in one of the family suites in Tower 1, which although on a low floor was perfect, plenty of space, very clean and well kitted out.  Nicole Lee and her team made us feel incredibly welcomed, and went well out of her way to make this special visit even more special (it was a dual celebration of my son’s birthday and our anniversary).  Of course the main attraction was the infinity pool on the 57th floor, which was probably the highlight of our stay - and where our kids (11 and 6) insisted we spend most of our time.  We ate lunch at the pool 2 out of the 3 days - it was very good and surprisingly not over priced as compared to many other 5+ star hotels.  The hotel itself is immense, but I can’t say that it felt super…",5,February 2020,
Top of the world,Mike Payne,"If going to Singapore wasn’t good enough, try visiting the Bay Area where you will find bars and restaurants including the famous merlion. Then a trip to floor 56 of the Marina Bay Sands for stunning views over Singapore or grab a meal or a drink in Ce la vie on floor 57. Fabulous",5,February 2020,
Good service and clean rooms,Carol O,"Nice view from hotel room balcony, friendly  and helpful service crew. Due to virus, there is lesser crowd and every lift lobby was placed a hand sanitiser. Love the indoor hot pool with sauna and steam room 😊 ",4,February 2020,
Singapore Luxury Icon,myangsf,"Stayed four nights recently in a Grand Club King City View room.  As the name suggests, the key feature is the amazing city view, enabled by floor-to-ceiling glass windows.  Room was amply sized for two, with a king bed, sofa, and wardrobe.  Drawer space seemed designed more for jewelry than clothes, but we improvised.  Bathroom was large, with a decadently spacious shower area and beautiful tub.  Guests should be mindful of the tile floors, which can be treacherously slippery when wet.  Service was friendly, and unexpectedly prompt, given the large casino-like atmosphere.  Club level includes access to the 55th floor lounge with great views and an extensive breakfast buffet.  Access to Marina Bay shopping and Gardens By the Bay is extremely convenient.  Will definitely consider…",5,February 2020,
Has to be done!,beforeyouaccuseme,"Has to be done if for nothing more than the obligatory photo from the roof top pool. Get a garden view room - which also looks over the harbour - best views EVER! Get a room above the 22nd floor or you have to change lifts to get to the roof top. Don’t include breakfast, get that from the pool cafe on the roof top. We loved our family stay. We loved Singapore!  ",5,January 2020,
5star club service on a prime location,LynVR,"My husband and I stayed here for our 3yr Anniversary and the staff made it extra special for us with unexpected Happy Anniversary cake delivered to our room despite their 2nd failed attempt to personally greet us in our room. We also booked hotel room with stunning view of downtown & marina bay, you could see fountain show every nite from your room. The club room was worth the extra with  delicious Breakfast & view! We also went to all 3 restaurants at the top, Spago for yummy lunch, Lavo Italian for dinner  and CeLavie with the sweeping view of the Gardens by the bay which was perfect ambience to celebrate our Anniversary.

Great experience,CatieGC,"Enjoyed my brief stay at Marina Bay Sands.  The rooms are lovely.  The views are exceptional.  Of course, the rooftop pool makes it all worth it.  Love that the pool wasn’t terribly crowded!!  Will certainly be back!",5,February 2020,
Met my expectations,CHENCHIAHUNG,"We have two adults and two children, so I had to book a family studio room. The room was perfect except was too expensive and on the second level without any city views. The room was spacious, clean and came with a long bar table which was extremely convenient for family. Service was exceptional, when I was standing in a long line for checking, a gentleman guided me to a club check-in room, and then a lady gave me early check-in. The infinity pool was really magnificent, perhaps because of the coronavirus, there were quite few guests, so pool water was very clean. Good service by the pool, we enjoyed our lunch there. But you had to wear your swimsuit in your room and took the elevator to the pool, the changing room on the rooftop was not only having an inconvenient and…",4,February 2020,
A great stay. Worth to do Club Room,TravelAddict,"Just returned from a one night stay. Done the club room, really worth it as you get generous portions for Afternoon Tea & Evening Canapaes, also a hearty breakfast in the morning.  Pool is amazing and due to lack of crowds because of the virus we had it all to ourselves near enough.  Can pay deposit and room buy card/cash.",5,February 2020,

Amazing hotel.,Yevgeniya MG,"We stayed at this hotel in February 2020. The hotel is amazing, the best breakfast I had so far (with different cuisines: international breakfast, Indian, Chinese and even more). The stuff is very friendly and helpful. Locations is great - next to MRT, gardens by the bay, etc. The top roof bar, swimming pool, restaurant are really great. We had a room with a balcony - the view is breathtaking! Would love to come again ",5,February 2020,
Enjoy Singapore hospitality at its best here.,Arun Rao,"Great place to go for a dinner at the restaurant Lavo on the 57th floor. Cuisine is superb, service is excellent and the ambiance - whether you opt to sit inside or out on the balcony - is just wonderful. Looking forward to going there again!",5,September 2019,
A Great Stay!,Spincentury,"We spent 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.  As one would expect, the highlight is the architecture of the hotel itself.  Truely amazing.  We had an upgraded room with club access.  The room was large with a semi separated sitting area.  The bed was a bit firm for our liking, but, all in all a very comfortable room.  Our view overlooked Gardens By the Bay which was amazing both during the day and at night.  The club was well worth it.....breakfast was very good as were drinks and canapes in the evening.  The pool on the top of the hotel was spectacular.  The hotel is a 1 to 2 km walk from plenty of good restaurants and local attractions.  The only down side of staying here is the somewhat Disneyland feel to the whole place.  A lot of selfie crazed, fairly abnoxious guests. …",4,February 2020,
Amazing,Bruce & Tay,We stayed her for four nights and couldn’t fault a thing. We love the roof top infinity pool and that it was family friendly.

THE POOL!,Munezza,"The pool makes it all worth it!!!!!!! I cannot emphasize this enough. THE POOL VIEW!!! The room is nice, the service was great, and the view was absolutely amazing! My husband and I visited Singapore for 3 nights/ 4 days. Perfect length of stay. We did everything we wanted to do in Singapore with out feeling too rushed and exhausted. I went to the Marina Bay Sands pools every single day. If you're trying to get the perfect picture without too many ppl, try to go early early a.m. I went right when they opened, because jet-lag LOL  We tried a new breakfast buffet each morning, and Club55 was the best. All were good, but 55 had the best food. Spago/ Rise was also great and loved being out near the pool deck.   One word: Coronavirus! Upon arrival, there was a note in our room that…",4,January 2020,

Upon checkin our room was upgraded and checkout was extended without-even asking.In conversation we explained to the gentleman checking us in we were traveling for 4 months  with our 3 year old daughter. He was kind enough to write down a list of must visit places places in the Philippines while we are there.  Our room was huge and everything was of a standard you would expect.   We didn’t opt for breakfast due to the cost but did try the buffet one evening which again was excellent. A huge amount of different cuisines and all excellent quality.

We had a minor issue in our first room but the manager responsiveness was incredible and switched us rooms immediately, great attention since arrival and really appreciated how the hotel was taking precautions regarding the ongoing virus.   The location is priceless, you have the gardens, shopping center, tourist attractions everything walking distance, enjoyed so much!   The infinity Pool was the best part, makes it all worth it!

Nice view,Magnus_Liljeroth," Nice view, but otherwise nothing special. Better to go to some bar or restaurant down town. This place is a little offsite. You need a bus or cab ride to go there. Otherwise, Singapore is a nice but somewhat odd country to go to.  ",3,January 2020,

Multiple places to eat and drink, the Observation Deck, the Vanishing Edge Pool that is 57 stories above the streets, it doesn’t get much better than this! Some of the best Singapore sites are within walking distance, or take the MRT Subway; spotlessly clean and safe.",5,February 2020,

Excellent pool and location but bed quality can be improved,FarAway786171,"Have stayed here a few times over the years and have always enjoyed coming to MBS. However, during my most recent stay on 8th Feb, I noticed that the quality of the bed had been rather poor, causing me to experience severe back ache since the stay.

The reason I traveled to Singapore,digitalroc,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an entertainment destination, and the reason why I traveled to Singapore!  I arrived in Singapore mid-afternoon and took a taxi from Changi Airport to Marina Bay Sands.  I entered the short queue to check-in, I was greeted with a bottle of water, and moments later with the friendly front desk staff.  The check-in process was quick and I was off to my room on the 31st floor facing the Garden by the Bay, which is exactly the view I wanted!    The room was spacious, clean and very inviting.  The bathroom was large, the shower was fantastic, comfy slippers were provided, and most importantly the bed was super comfortable.  Housekeeping had a good attention to detail, right down to the towel origami.    There is lots of things going on at Marina Bay Sands,…",5,December 2019,

Fantastic Stay,khrlhmd,Booked the Premier Room with Harbour View and we were located on the 41st floor. Room is nicely design with mirrors all around the room. Bathrobes were available for use. Room had a mini balcony overlooking the Garden by the Bay. Able to view the Serene Garden with no obstruction. Bathtub is available in the toilet too. Visited the Club 55 and in house guest had a 15% discount off the bill. Infinity pool is not to be missed. Recommended to go early in the morning to catch the sunrise and swim with a view as it is less crowded. Shout out to Guest Service Edwin for the great insights around the hotel!,5,February 2020,
Impressive infinity pool but long lines at checkin,Sandra U,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands one night because I wanted to try the infinity swimming pool.  Also the spaceship appearance of the hotel is stunning.  The hotel checkin desk is part of a shopping mall and near a casino.  When we arrived, there were lines of people attempting to check in or check out.  Perhaps 200 people were in line.  We were grabbed by an assistant and taken to the VIP check-in reception area.  There were perhaps 8 people in line in the VIP area.  The people being served had some problem and one took at least 20 minutes and the other took at least 10 minutes.  Our room was what I call “nice holiday inn”.  The room itself was not impressive, clean, but nothing special.  The view however was fantastic.  We overlooked the Gardens by the Bay.

Iconic,julian c,"Marina Bay Sands dominates the skyline in Singapore and has quickly become one of tourists must see locations. If you can afford to stay here, you get to visit the Sky Deck for free and of course use that iconic swimming pool.

The iconic pool is not to be missed - fun to swim around at the top of the world! The hotel staff was very attentive, we had a snafu that they more than compensated for. Plenty of places to eat with a great variety of cuisines. Not for someone wanting a relaxing experience - but great if you want around the clock entertainment. The water show is amazing as well.",4,July 2019,
Infinity pool,Jany Nguyen,"This was a special visit for our honeymoon and it was such a beautiful hotel with wonderful service! What made it even better was the attentiveness and cheerful service from one of the lifeguards we met at the pool, Ryan Goh. He was informative, courteous, friendly and humorous, sharing great anecdotes and suggestion about the hotel. You can tell how much he loves his job by how good he is at it. It was greatly appreciated and truly made a difference in our stay. We hope to see Ryan again on our next visit!",5,February 2020,
Drop in quality and service,Mr. G,"I have been to this hotel a few times. Every time seems to be getting down in service. Having in mind that the Corona virus is an issue at  the moment your check in experience,instead of greeting you properly they immediately ask you questions like have you been in china over the past 14 days and then just measure your temperature, and then it’s let’s get down to business. They could have easily put one of those big temperature monitoring cameras on the entrance and checked everyone making it less personal and intruding. You get the feeling that you are being so monitored and policed. It can be done in a less offending way. You can do that you can’t do that, and the pool especially has lost its glamor feel where you are greeted and taken to your place , now it’s like how ever…",3,February 2020,

Everything you expected,Harrycrac,"Stayed here three nights on a stopover and didn't regret spending so much money on a room here. There are many other lovely hotels to choose from so won't stay again, just because of the price, I was a solo traveller so the room charge did not offer value. You are paying for the service, the surroundings, the pool, the experience. I really enjoyed myself and had a lovely room on 9th floor, very comfortable and could not fault anything at all. The hotel is really a resort and it can be overwhelming when you arrive, three receptions, so many lifts and not all go to the floor you want. So allow a bit of time and patience to find your way around this complex. Shops, casino, bars, restaurants, spa it has everything so you don't need to venture out. I had a wonderful stay.",5,July 2019,
Average,Zach B,"Everyone except the front desk guy was snobby AF, I think his name was Mansor, he was really nice and the only good thing. This isn’t a luxury hotel it’s a basic 4 star hotel with a pretty pool. Musky smell in hallways. The elevator is annoying and they could definitely have better signage to direct you. Everything’s got different closing times. Felt like my whole time was spent walking hallways looking for proper elevator. Concierge desk was very unhelpful. Nobody has any information. Had a terrible experience at lavo and everything is beyond overpriced. ",3,February 2020,
Obviously this is a badge of Singapore,roman511p,"At the time it was opened I was a student in a poor country and was only able to dream about... Now, traveled around the world it was still a POI we simply could not miss, stopping by in Singapore. IMHO at this moment Gardens is the best attraction and it is free)) But hotel itself gives the atmosphere you need to pay for. Recommend unless it’s your monthly income - in this case just enjoy surrounding ",5,February 2020,

WONDERFUL STAY OVERALL,Ellinlaw .,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We got a suite on one of the top floors and the view was spectacular. Included with the suit was the access to Club 55, so we enjoyed the perks that came with it: breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour. We noticed a long line to get into the regular breakfast restaurant so being able to eat at the club was nice. The room was spacious and clean and the maid did a wonderful job at replenishing properly the towels and cosmetics. They accommodated our request for an extra twin bed but the service on that was quite slow. The pool offered a fabulous panorama of the city and I'd recommend going there during the day and at night. The view is quite breathtaking. On the less positive side, the check in service took a while, there is no doorman…",5,December 2019,

Don't stay there,Anel,"Was so excited to stay at the hotel.  But the service and food are horrible. Took us more than 1 hour to check in, even though i did it prior to speed up the process lol.  ok, at the check in counter, they asked for the passport details even though at the online check in i already provided everything. So i guess their system is not interconnected between departments at all.  Service by the pool is horrible. Unfortunately, you can  feel racism. They would serve first Asians, then others. Even if you were first.  On a positive note, great views and clean rooms.",3,January 2020,
Beautiful Hotel,Barry Webster,What an amazing building.It stands out above everything on the skyline.Unfortunately we didnt stay here but had a great tour all around it At between $600 and $700 a night It is hard to justify the price.,5,January 2020,
Great hotel but service could be better..,Dove,"My partner and I chose this hotel to celebrate our 6 year anniversary. Hotel is gorgeous, we stayed on 47 floor and had the club room (great drinks, afternoon tea). Breakfast near the pool at Spago was fab too. View of the city - incredible! Pool was enjoyable too. We did a sunrise yoga - highly recommend it, the trainer (didn’t catch his name) was really cool too.  One thing that was quite sad - was the service. When we arrived we informed the hotel we are celebrating and the lady at check in said we will get a surprise in the room. We got nothing, mentioned it when checking out and the lady wasn’t apologetic at all, she said she will inform people and nothing was offered. We stayed at 5 star hotels previously where we were treated so well, but this was quite disappointing.…",5,February 2020,

Upon checking in, I went straight to the pool as that for me is the main attraction of this hotel, unfortunately it was underwhelming when I arrived and left me disappointed as I had spent alot of money. I chose a bed closest to the water and there was newspaper pieces wet all around the beds, cutlery on the floor, empty bottles, paper in the pool... it was just really dirty. The barmen were walking back and forth jus ignoring the unhygienic mess, no cleaner in sight. When I gave my order to a barman, I asked if he could pick up the soaking newspaper from under my bed which he politely did, I also mentioned that the litter everywhere was really bad but it was left for hours before being picked up.

Wowed!,PDMM_Gourmands,"One pays SG$23 to get up to the rooftop bar and they in turn give you a SG$23 coupon for the bar - all cocktails are $23...how cool!!!  Had a SIngapore Sling (so did my friends) and various ginger foods. Also had wine, G&T - all was excellent...especially the prices given that this is a 5* hotel/resort. Loved the service and attention to detail. The place was very chilled-out and unassuming. I will return. ",5,January 2020,
For their famous pool and much more,Y880,"Rooms in this integrated resort are basic and very much like what you can get in a business hotel, so nothing to rave about unless you get one with a good view of the Gardens by the Bay.  The view from their SkyPark and famous infinity pool on Level 57 is on the other hand everything to go for as part of the perks as a guest.  Other than its perfect location to explore the sights in the area and direct connection to the train station, this is also the only place to stay where one can have easy access to the most number of award-winning restaurants on site. With the casino, museum, theatre, clubs and most shops which open till late, guests will not run out of things to do during their stay.",4,January 2020,
Amazing views,sharon t,"We never stayed in the hotel but we went for a night out to the rooftop bar it was amazing the views were just spectacular.Malaysia could be seen in the distance because it was such a clear night and the light show is great to see from so high up,this is not to be missed when your in Singapore.",5,January 2020,
One of my absolute favorite hotels!,Michael T,"The Marina Bay Sands really is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. We had the pleasure of staying in one of the Sands Suites at MBS and received the best service and had such a great experience at the hotel. The 24 hour butler service was so helpful and they never allowed us to want for anything. There was always someone at the hotel trying to make our stay even more special and I just can’t say enough good things about the Marina Bay Sands. I highly recommend staying there and giving yourself ample opportunity to explore the hotel grounds, because the options at MBS are really unparalleled.",5,January 2020,
The best stay so far,Wanderlust2906,"My stay at Marina Bay was so perfect. I wish I stayed longer here. The price per night is expensive but I think this is worth it, the property is immaculate and impressive. The skypark, the infinity pool, jacuzzi everything is unmissable!!

One night in luxury,lmnop_12,"If you have the time and money to spend (not just for the viewing deck), maybe a special occasion, please stay here to experience the service, warmth, cleanliness, cuisine, infinity pool and breathtaking views of this iconic hotel.

"FANTASTIC architecture, but as a hotel “just” a massive “bed factory” and a money machine (for the owner)",jesperostergaard,"We stayed at the hotel about 10 years ago just after the grand opening. A lot of facilities were not finished/ready at that time - and perhaps therefore the hotel was not fully booked. (And there was a nice feel to it)   This time we went to Singapore we chose Marina Bay Sands again as we had invited my parents (my father is architect and I wanted him to experience this fantastic construction ).   And the building and construction is still fantastic - must be on top 5 of the most iconic buildings in the world.   BUT apart from that - this hotel is (with 2560 rooms) one big “bed factory” - very unpersonal, extremely high noise level no matter where you are - reception hall, restaurants, pool area, garden - NOISE EVERYWHERE.

Has to be the best in Singapore,Nigel M,"Yes, it is expensive but worth it. Fantastic room with views over Singapore. The roof top infinity pool is a must, we were lucky to be able to check in early so went up straight away, there was a shortage of sunbeds from 15.00 onwards. The towels are to die for, so big soft and warm and you are not restricted to 1 per person. Great adults only area of the pool strictly enforced by the lifeguards! All the staff are so helpful, courteous and pleasant, nothing is too much trouble. Only downsides, too many tourists who just come to look and get in the way. the hotel is mean in the bar, not even a few free nuts when you order cocktails.",5,January 2020,
Perfect first stop of our honeymoon!,Natan Edelsburg,We spent the first two nights of our honeymoon at the MBS and it was a perfect two days. The staff gave us an amazing upgrade on the 49th floor overlooking the city and treated us to honeymoon surprises! The pool was perfect as always.

Worth at least a one-night stay,yalibrarian,"Due to the price, we opted to stay elsewhere during our trip, but treated ourselves to one night here in a premier room overlooking the bay.  Worth every nickel.  Basically, it's worth it just to lounge at the pool, sit in the hot tubs overlooking the Gardens by the Bay, and to take your instagram photos in the infinity pool.  We didn't have any trouble finding loungers, although we stayed on the adult-only side (west side) -- the side with kids might be more crowded.  Friendly staff and a good food/drink menu poolside.  Other aspects:  rooms are nice with free water bottles, robes, toiletries, refrigerator, and coffee maker.  Curtains automatically open when you open the door -- my daughter and nephew went gaga over that feature.  If you have a bay view, you can see the light…",5,January 2020,

Infinity and Beyond,Michael C,"We choose a premier room and it was on a lower floor, the information I had was that the balcony view was looking out over the road.  Whilst that was true beyond the road was the Gardens on the Bay.  These gardens have a light show nightly we could watch perfectly from the balcony of our room. Our room was big in size, we had two double beds and a very well presented bathroom, shower and toilet. Our housekeeping lady was simply fantastic. What can I say about the hotel, it is clearly massive in size with three towers which contain in excess of 2000 rooms. This means the hotel is very busy and may not be to everyone’s liking. The hotel has plenty of restaurants if you want to eat there but at busy times be prepared to queue for breakfast. Our favourite breakfast location Spago on…",5,January 2020,
amazing architecture.,kma715,"amazing design.   The ROOMS VERY PRICEY.    Lowest rate $360 Singapore dollars......WILL NOT BUDGE BELOW THIS PRICE.   The casino is beautiful, but as usual....DO NOT TRY to win much money.    The casino service is good with some good food places inside.  IF NEED ATM....and you will! ......gotta EXIT THE CASINO to get to ATM then ENTER BACK IN THRU SECURITY.",4,January 2020,
Epitome of Luxury,Yash S,"We were on 27th floor. We had selected Garden view. After that I would have preferred City view. The much awaited part for me was the infinity pool. The view from there was just amazing. It has a different vibe altogether.   The premises encompasses everything restaurants, roof top bars, mall, games & other activities. It is very well connected by road & metro. Major Tourist attractions are nearby.   Best way to commute in Singapore is via Metro. Very well connected",5,February 2019,
Iconic,alpatdunc,This is an amazing building to photograph and to just look at especially at night when all the lights come on.  For me it's iconic Singapore.  We didn't go up to the viewing area as there are so many other ways to see Singapore.  It is quite an amazing building.,3,January 2020,
Much less than expected,welltraveledA,"Got a premier sky room which was big in size little dull very good view of the city Long line for check in and out ,crowded pool ,very expensive terrace restaurant ,got 3 rooms ,where located in complete diferent building You have to stay once and that was for us  Spectacular building zero five star experience",3,September 2019,
Amazing resort,WanderingAroundTheWorld,We stayed here for 2 nights when visiting Singapore and I am glad we did. This place is amazing and so luxurious and is a resort in itself. There is a casino that we didn’t go in.  A high end shopping mall with its own canal and top restaurants.  The gym is well equipped and located on the 55th floor with amazing views over the bay and Singapore. There is also a bar open to the public on the 55th floor but is $27 for a bottle of Stella. On the top floor there is the 150m long infinity pool which is lined with sun loungers and is great for taking a selfie with the city in the background. You cannot go to the pool unless you are staying at the hotel. A short 5 minute walk from the hotel is the marina bay itself with light shows and restaurants and about 5 minutes in the other…,5,January 2020,
Don't book if you have a late flight!,Stephanie P,"Facilities are of course great - no doubt about that! 3 issues we experienced:  1) We were a bit put off by the check-in. In general, the hotel is super crowded and you will have to wait in line quite a while before you can check in (felt like being at the DMV instead of a 5 star hotel) - luckily, there is a quick check-out though. 2) Paying a room here doesn't really make you feel like a guest, but basically only entitles you to spend more money. E.g., you can pay for a VIP check-in, breakfast is of course not included, etc. So it did just not feel like you got what you paid for.  3) Most importantly for us, but of course a specific situation due to travel times:  What they don't tell you before booking is that you can only access the sky pool from check-in to check-out time,…",2,January 2020,
Great place to watch the sunset & people watch,whiteknight,"Drinks at the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel on Grand Prix practice day.  $23 per person to get to the top & have access to the bar & seating area, the ticket includes a drink. Very buzzy place with lively party atmosphere. Super views over Singapore & great place to watch the sun set.  No access to infinity pool or restaurant unless you are staying in the hotel.

Walk along the dragonfly garden and u will be able to get these shots.from bayfront mrt, take the route ro garden  by the bay, there is a red bridge,  cross it, turn left.  this walkway is below the bridge, i find  that the night shots are better.",5,January 2020,
Not worth the cost,Natasha D,We stayed here for two nights and felt it was overpriced.  The bed was hard and not comfortable. It was a nice room but not worth the money we paid. We ate at Spago and it was great. The pool was cold but worth going in. It was nice that they had an adult only section and their were plenty of lounge chairs available. I would recommend only one night so you can use the pool but won’t need to stay here again.,3,January 2020,
Worth it!,David B,"Yes it's on the pricey side for my budget and you're paying for the pool/view but in the end.....it was worth it!!  Check in was crowded but a staff member pointed out we could go to the 2nd check in desk, which had a much shorter line.  Nita greeted us like we were her favorite client all day!  After a very sweaty morning, the infinity pool felt soo good.  The area was pretty full but it wasn't the madhouse I was expecting, we found seats right away.  the drink service was fairly timely considering the volume.  If you stay on floors 34 or lower, you will have to transfer elevators at the 34th floor.   Room was very nice but not over the top, very nice bathroom!",5,January 2020,
Pillay,Naicker,I recently stayed at this hotel I wasn’t impressed the service wasn’t the greatest my experience also. Breakfast was good the room average. View was the best thus far. It was close to must sightseeing and shopping area metro was not bad.,3,January 2020,
Priceless view,By Eljay,"WOW! What a view This is a must do if staying in Singapore. The view of the sunrise over Gardens by the Bay, is like nothing I have ever experienced before, just spectacular. The room was comfortable and spacious, service excellent, and so close to everything at Marina Bay",5,June 2019,
Gorgeous,Kathleen W,"The hotel and the mall attached to it, and of course the entire tree park area was amazing. The architecture inside the Sands, the infinity pool and food/drink service by the water, was great. It's one of my favorite parts of Singapore. There is easy access to the trees, where there are various admissions for museums, and we visited everything at both day and nighttime. Our room had a view of the trees which was gorgeous to see, as well. The room was clean, the bathroom spacious, and the welcome seamless.",5,January 2020,
Pride of our nation,Riley Griff,"Place symbolises our nation. Many travelers all over the world comes to this place, so i think you should too. Behind this building there is a very big artificial garden where you can enjoy your time in tranquility.",5,January 2020,
Observation deck,Josie C,After a trip on Clark Quay and a wander through the very expensive shopping mall we reached the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.  The common areas of the hotel are very crowded and whilst impressive in stature it didnt have a very special feel about it.  The lift to the observation deck was efficient and the views amazing across the city including the F1 circuit.  Definitely worth a visit.,5,January 2020,
Great Hotel. Worth the money,Hollie H,"We were reluctant to book here because of the price, but it is definitely worth it, even just for one night. The infinity sky pool is incredible and a must see. You can only access it if you stay at the hotel, so this was the tipping point for us. They allowed us to check in early, which was great, all staff very polite. The pool was surprisingly not too busy. We arrived mid morning and got two beds straight away. Plenty of towels to use too. It was windy, because it is so high up but a welcomed breeze. The view from the top is incredible and one you cannot find any where else.  The room was lovely, big bed, nice bathroom and nice toiletries. 4 bottles of water included in the room and a nice balcony too.   For the price, all of the above is to be expected, but not always the…",5,January 2020,
Not to be missed Singaporean experience in an amazing landmark building,Masami M,"We stayed in a nearby hotel, but visited the foyer and the bar on the top to experience the atmosphere. Building itself is so eye-catching and fabulous to look at...especially if you've seen the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"". We booked a table at the top bar adjacent to the restaurant. If you come just before dusk, you'll be able to enjoy the earlier light show in Gardens by the Bay when the Super-trees light up. You can enjoy drinks and nice bar food whilst lapping up the spectacular sights. Not to be missed on a visit to Singapore!",5,January 2020,
Sands Skypark Observation deck provides panoramic view of Singapore,Vijay S,A panoramic view of Singapore can be seen from Sands Skypark Observation deck all 56 level. The view at night especially sound and light show in Marina Bay is amazing from that level. Even lights of Thai coastline are visible. Place a must visit at night while visiting Singapore.,5,January 2020,
Great drinks,Maury C,"We went there for drinks, all the way up to one of its bars. Great service, Singapore Slings, amazing views of the bay, we even saw the fountain show taking place at the bottom of the hotel. The Infinity Pool was just next to the bar. Will definitely go back, next time will stay at the hotel.",5,May 2019,
Absolute luxury,David,"I came close to overlooking MBS when selecting accommodation in Singapore, deterred by the price tag. But after treating myself to two nights in this architectural icon, I have to say that it is money well spent. Staff go out of their way to ensure that guests have the most enjoyable experience, from the time you arrive to the moment you check-out and every visit to the infinity pool in between. Rooms are well-appointed and the epitome of luxury, with automated curtains and subtle, sophisticated lighting. The bathroom is the real stand-out though, with a gorgeous stand-alone bath in its own wet-room space. Then there are the views. My suggestion is to book over-looking the garden, as there are plenty of other vantage points from which to see the bay and the city, such as the…",5,January 2020,

Amazing!,Mollyrose25,Stayed here for one night for the experience and as a treat for my husbands birthday. Staff were so friendly and amazing we even got an upgrade and a birthday cake left in our amazing suite. This hotel is stunning. Yes it’s very expensive so you get what you pay for. If you can treat yourself it’s well worth just one nights stay for the experience and to use the amazing pool. We loved it and wish we could have afforded to stay longer!,5,January 2020,
MBS - one of the best,Marvelash,"We had a night stay over in MBS and it was a lovely stay. Staff was polite and helpful. The hotel has rooftop bar, restaurant and infinity swimming pool so worth visiting and staying over.   It's very close to Gardens by the bay and you can see the night light show from the roof top. We were allowed late checkout.   Hotel is expensive but it's worth a visit!   If you are vegetarian, they have quite a few items in their restaurant menu..  Mind well..if you are off to the airport from the hotel...most of the taxi companies have a fixed price",5,January 2020,
Amazing Pool - Needs an Update!,CaioZanette,"I’ve stay at the Sands in late November 2019 for a 2 day business trip. The hotel is huge, my suite was overlooking the gardens, with a balcony. Suite was large, comfortable bed and large shower - but rooms are somewhat outdated, carpeted floors needing some treatment as well as furniture and overall appearance. The pool on the top floor is amazing - huge, fantastic view of the city and Singapore is just great! Breakfast at Lavo was very good - several options, side of the pool. And the hotel has a casino and a huge mall attached to it - you can go using the stairwells directly. There you will find shopping attractions and many places to have a meal. For me it is a need to go for the pool, if it is something that you like! On the same price range and if pool is not your thing,…",4,November 2019,
Vast Hotel,Chris D,"Fascinating hotel with pool on roof. Amenities in hotel and surroundings are excellent. Rooms large and breakfast expansive. However because of its size it lacks the ability to provide a personal touch. It welcomes, at a cost, the general public, which limits the guests options a little. Trying too hard to be everything to everybody. Pool on the roof is more a posing pool with 80% of those in the 1.2m deep pool having a mobile phone in hand taking selfies and getting in the way of swimmers limited though they are. Totally insufficient sun beds or chairs to accommodate all wishing to use the facility. Convenient location for Mall, Botanical gardens, and access to down town including Raffals. But overstretched. Overall expensive and not great value.",3,January 2020,
Very nice.,koolrunnins,"Marina Bay Sands is just beautiful. Roof top Sky Deck was just amazing as advertised. Attached to a large mall as well as the Gardens, lots of things to see and do. The Casino was also wonderful. I just found the hotel to have too many people from all walks of life, who were not guests, wandering around all the facilities, causing it to be extremely crowded, large tour groups, children crying, just not what I was looking for from such a high end property.  Imagine if you went to Las Vegas and there was only one hotel on the strip, and everyone who visits the city stops in there to look around. That's what it felt like.  I left and went to the Four Seasons. Aaaah!",5,December 2019,
Christmas break,msabir4,"Very big hotel with a huge swimming and spa area on the roof top. Busy place at all hours similar to a small shopping mall.

a few days in Singapore,Linda W,"So pleased I did not listen to other people or heed the reviews. We stayed in tower 2 on the 42 floor, expensive but so worth the money. From booking in until a taxi ride to the airport, we had the time of our life. The club rooms are so worth the extra, breakfast , afternoon tea, drinks and canapés we did not once buy a meal or drink out !!. The pool and spa are a must and never once felt looked at. Brilliant stay.",5,December 2019,
Wow,Neenie77,"This hotel is amazing. The views, the staff, the food and cocktails were all amazing. We opted for an upgraded room with a marina view which I would recommend. The room was spacious and very well equipped to a high standard. Room service was equally as good as main dining and the roof top bar is a brilliant experience especially at night.  Would definitely recommend and this won’t be our last visit. Just fabulous!",5,December 2019,
Incredible Hotel Stay,Jane L,"I booked a 2 bedroom and was upgraded to one of their suites. It was so spacious, luxurious and had an incredible view of the Garden by the Bay!!! When we walked into the hotel lobby, there were so many people and the check in process was quite impersonal that I thought this is a ""one and done"" stay. Was I totally surprised by the room and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore. The pool was okay only because it was so crowded.",5,December 2019,
Excellent stay,RayFamily1,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands during the Christmas period 24/12/19 - 29/12/19.  We booked a deluxe skyview room over looking the city.  The room was on the 52nd floor and is probably the biggest room I have ever stayed in.  Bathroom was great (no bath) only shower which is fine for us as we haven't used a bath in years.  You have a bed area with a TV and also a sitting area with separate TV.  The room was cleaned immaculately every day and we were left different towel animals each day, they are the cutest.  So most people stay for the infinity pool and it doesn't disappoint, fantastic views of the city while your splashing about.  The water is a little cold, it does get busy, however we notice that it is a fairly high turnover so you may not get the beds you want when you…",5,December 2019,
An over the top experience,MrsTheophile,"We stayed in this hotel during the F1 race. It lives up to billing. The hotel is a huge complex, but that doesn't mean that the service and accommodations are not uniformly good. They are. Sure, the pool would get crowded (we went for in the mornings). But everything was top notch - from the views of Gardens by the Bay, the size of the rooms, room service, the food, check-in and access to public transportation. I would stay here again.",5,September 2019,
Fantastic Hotel!,Collette B,"Wasn’t sure if we were doing the right thing staying here but so glad we did! Had the best time, room was wonderful and the view amazing. The roof top pool was something else, open until 11pm and busy all the time. But lots of fun, everyone just wanted to get photos whatever time of the day. Breakfast buffet was so good, everything that you good possibly think of was there and so fresh and delicious! Great location right by the Gardens, Shopping Mall and River Ferry (lovely trips)",5,January 2020,
Spectacular hotel with best views of the Gardens by the Bay,GabriellaBrondani,"This hotel's reputation of course precedes itself, and so for my first time in Singapore decided to stay here for one night. The price per room per night is of course quite high (when compared to other accommodation you can find in Singapore) but there's a reason you pay - for the service, the views and the amenities. All absolutely superb! The rooms were very spacious, modern and clean. We chose a room with views of the Gardens which we were very happy with as the views by day and by night are incredible. Guests of the hotel have access to the rooftop infinity pool (that you see in 1000s of pictures on Instagram).The views up there are spectacular, but, because it's so well known, expect TONS of people in the pool literally just sitting in there posing for the perfect IG shot.…",5,September 2019,
A lovely welcome,valentine77,We checked in this morning and as soon as we arrived we was fortunate enough to be welcome at the reception by a lovely receptionist Andrea.

Impressive hotel but impersonal service,ml5217,"Stayed here at the start of our honeymoon. On checking in the receptionist asked were we on holiday and we told her honeymoon. She congratulated us & when we got to the room we had a ""happy anniversary"" cake. We didnt receive anything else to mark our honeymoon so it didnt feel that special.   The room was spacious and comfortable. We stayed 2 nights and only received turn down on the first night. I found it odd that for such a large room and bathroom it was shower only - no bath. Which would have been nice to relax in after a long day walking round Singapore.  We used the pool and had no issues, busy but not crowded & just amazing views on both sides. It was the main reason we booked here for our honeymoon.  If returning to Singapore I would not stay here again. It is good for…",4,December 2019,

Stunningly amazing hotel!,Sappi2016,"I stayed at Marina bay Sands from 26 Dec, 2019 to 30. When arriving, I felt literally a stunning feeling I’ve never experienced at the entrance floor. The first impression was like, how large! how tall! and how glittery! My room was “Premier Twin Garden View” type on 26th floor. Some sort of plant just outside the window disturbed the view though, we enjoyed the beautiful sea horizon of Singapore. Amenities are nice and luxury of the room was ok. maybe the same as Hilton. Rooftop pool was amazing but I did not swim. Just enjoyed the atmosphere. The room services were splendid. You might want to bring your own plug converter for your hair drier otherwise it may be broken b/c of high voltage. Don’t miss the botanical garden. As to the nightlife, I spent such wonderful nights…",4,December 2019,
Amazing!,brunkmaster,"Amazing experience! The check in felt very welcoming and I loved how the check in agent took the time to ask me about my trip and making time for me. It made me feel as a very special guest even im just an average Joe. Was very glad that my room was available from 7.30am when I came! Was also upgraded to a club room which was even better!  Pool was amazing and I also loved the jacuzzi to the stunning views! I was extremely happy with the fact that I didnt smell cigarette smoke at all by the pool area! In other roof top pools there was always this issue with people smoking and us non smokers always had to stand the obnoxious smoke. But this hotel had made sure that this was never an issue!  Cant really fault anything, the only thing was that the fridge wasnt cold enough.  What…",5,January 2020,
Amazing experience!,Ryan,"Absolutely amazed with my experiance at this hotel!  Upon our visit  we arrived early to drop our luggage off to be pleasantly told that our room was ready 3 hours ahead of our check in time which was a very welcoming surprise.   The room was very spacious and had plenty of storage, with an amazing bathroom topped with beautiful shower gels and shampoos  The view from the pool was absolutely outstanding which is only available to guests of the hotel  All staff were extremely kind and friendly.  Please be aware of how busy the ground floor reception area is as anyone including tourists can walk through the main reception   I would highly recommend staying here if visiting the beautiful country of Singapore",5,December 2019,
An absolute must in Singapore,Claudiato66,"Marina Bay Sands may not be the most charming hotel in Singapore but, as everyone knows, it offers one of the most beautiful rooftop pools in the world and enjoys an excellent location. So, although I find such a huge and impersonal hotel quite far from my personal preference, I think that a first stay in Singapore should be at Marina Bay Sands. Just forget any personal attention, be aware you are just a room number and you will be happy there.  Our Grand Cityview suite was perfect in all respects: the greatest view over the city, large marble bathroom and all amenities you could wish for. Spotlessly clean and very well kept as well. As you can imagine the pool easily gets quite crowded but you can enjoy it anyway: I suggest you get there early morning by 11.00 am at the latest.…",4,October 2019,
Appalling Service,Anthony F,"Staying here today following a two and a half week trip around Thailand and the service has been disgraceful, appalling, the worst we have had since we started our trip and what makes it worse is the price tag, over £350 for one night.  It took over 40 minutes to get checked in, it took less time to exit the plane, go through security and get our bags at the airport, our key card does not work in any of the barriers other than our room and the lift and we have been ignored in one of the hotel bars for 10 minutes whilst the staff stood around, took me three attempts to get a drink by the pool with around a 25 minute wait.  Just shocking, one of the worst levels of service I have had, but definitely making the top spot of worst service because of the rediculous price tag.  I never…",1,January 2020,
Amazing,Balines,"We arrived to the hotel early morning (around 7:30am) after a very long flight. To our amazement they gave us a room straight away! The room was amazing, 2 twin beds and 1 roll in, as we were 3 people in the room. The view is amazing! The room was huge, with the most beautiful bathroom I saw in a hotel. The pool... people wrote that it's crowded with no place to sit, and noisy and whatever but we could find a place to sit at all hours we went up. The hot tub was mostly empty and has a very good view as well. If you plan on swimming, this pool is not for that. it's for being inside the water and just enjoying the views. More for relaxing than doing anything else. If I ever return to Singapore I will go back to this hotel... Oh and it has a huge mall connected to it that you can…",5,December 2019,
Huge Hotel with good amenities,Heni Mohamed,"The one thing comes in mind when we hear about Marina Bay Sands is the three towers and one huge ship shaped structure on top.

(Spoil alert) Stay - Silent and peaceful :-) Food - Excellent :-) Staffs - Superb :-) Lobby - CROWDED :-( Amenities - Great :-) we had spent 3 nights in this huge hotel and we stayed in a room facing the gardens by the bay. the view from our room was great, specially at night when the garden comes live with all the color lights.

Amazing staff! Better than the infinity pool!,Omer S,"Great hotel in every way, great room / amazing pool, everything you’ve heard is true.  However I want to specifically give highest praise to the staff at the infinity pool.  I lost my phone and suspected it was maybe stuck in one of the towels I had thrown into the bin, or stuck under one of the pool chairs.  Andy the lifeguard helped lift the pool chairs to look under them. The staff - specifically Zadk, Didi, Norshaeera, Firdaus - emptied two whole bins of dirty towels with me and just when I was about to lose hope they found my phone!  So pleased with all of their efforts and now can relax and return home with phone in hand!",5,January 2020,

The Pearl Of Singapore,Strayanadvisor,My wife and I stayed here to try as its location and facilities enface value seemed to offer a great opportunity. We were staying at Sentosa however after two nights there with persistent and reoccurring issues we had to leave. Upon arrival here we were warmly greeted and check in was a breeze. We had access to club 55 so check in was via the lounge on the bottom floor which is hard to see but to the right of check in. Club 55 was beautifully presented with helpful staff however very few clientele dress anything better than very casual. Ce La Vie has beautiful views and if you book in advance you can have a absolute view of the city for sunset.

"Train, not MTR but staffs",brigettimoog,"Famed for hospitality, Singapore was our best ever expectation. But staffs here at MBS ruined our stay. The welcome is friendly, but what would be necessary to reach the quality of service requested from a hotel and the prices charged (costly anyway) :  WELL TRAINED STAFFS A.

"Budget offering, 5 star pricing",PoBo,"This is NOT where you want to stay. The hotel is full of tourists that probably have never stepped outside of their village before this.  It's crowded, hot (the air conditioning is always off).  The food here is so expensive and below average.  The buffet breakfast at Rise has good selection, but it's chaotic mess.  Servers are always running around and act like they can't hear you. The stations are always empty and you need to wait 10 minutes for items to be replenished. Worst part is the access to Gardens by the Bay.  One little elevator to cater to hundreds of guests.  The elevator has no A/C so it's like stepping into an oven with 10 other sweaty strangers.  10 years ago this place might have been cool, but it's clearly an aging relic that you will want to avoid at all cost.",1,January 2020,
Luxury ..worth the money,CMaryM,"Visited beginning of December 2019. Luckily the weather was mostly dry.  Worth every penny for this stay. Beautiful views from our balcony especially at night facing the gardens and bay. Very lucky to see a Christmas light show in the lit trees. The pool is beautiful and the jacuzzi. Room was very nice,comfy and clean. People are so nice,friendly and helpful everywhere. So clean and nice everywhere inside the hotel. Gardens well worth the money to visit. Choice of so many places to eat inside and outside the hotel. Don't miss out on the Singapore sling 😉  None of it cheap but good value. So glad we did the one night stop over on way to Australia from the UK.  Great experience and solved the jet lag problem too .",5,December 2019,

"awesome hotel,  definitely worth visiting once in my life despite high cost.",kumelys,"this was one of the most memorable hotels from many I stayed at in different countries. Infinity pool was awesome experience, access was only for hotel guests, but I fully understand that, it was full already and having outside visitors would not fit and make it very crowded and uncomfortable. My family of 3 persons was granted big family room as a bonus, although we booked cheapest option on lower floors and smaller size I think of 35m2. There were different restaurants on the top level, but we haven't been there, though they looked great and cozy.

Majestic Luxury,Sanav,"Marina Bay Sands is an engineering marvel and I spent a good amount of time just admiring its exterior beauty. We stayed in a family room for the first 3 nights (1 double bed and 2 single beds). The room is enormous, with more than adequate space for 4 adults, including your own balcony and 2 bathrooms (only 1 shower though). Unfortunately these rooms are on the lower levels of the hotel, so you do not get much of a view. However, for our final night we booked 2 deluxe rooms facing the harbour and these views were spectacular. There are a multitude of restaurants and bars to choose from, connected access to the mall across the street and a bridge to the famous Gardens by the Bay (take a trip at night for the full experience). The staff are friendly and helpful. The main…",5,December 2019,
Great place to finish off our trip,Shannon E,"Spent the last two nigths of our trip here and glad we did! Wonderful Garden Club room with access to the Lounge, excellent service and staff.

Comprehensive New Years Eve Review,Gustavo C,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights for New Years Eve 2020. The stay was expensive; $700 USD average per night for the cheapest room type. We stayed the other nights of the trip at the Grand Hyatt Singapore so that we wouldn't go broke on our trip. When we left the Hyatt to go check in at the MBS, we figured there would be no chance that our room would be ready. We checked in at 9:00 am and they not only got us a room right then, they also gave us one on a high floor (36) even though we had paid the cheapest rate which was for the bottom 10 floors.  The rooms are nice. Modern fittings and they come with little balconies. The beds are hard but the shower pressure is elite. There is no bad view since you will either see the bay and all the skyscrapers, or you will be on the…",5,December 2019,

Luxe and magnificent harbour suite,V. A,"We stayed in the Harbour Suite. It was huge and we had an uninterrupted view of the light shows at night. It is a little noisy though. For some reason it isn't as quite as expected.  The hotel itself was very busy. We had an exclusive lift which skipped the first 25 levels or so and free bottles of water which were very welcome considering the amount of people scattered in the lobby.  Despite being very busy, housekeeping did a very thorough job and went above and beyond. She (or he) folded my daughter's used pajamas and laid them on the huge bed. They made sure the room is neat, tidy and clean  I really appreciated coming back to a clean and tidy room. They worked very hard. Floor was squeaky and the cot was always made up.  To be honest, the space and view is well worth the…",5,March 2019,
The view is just breath taking,Getaway32496708429,"If am going back to Singapore for holidays then definitely its Mariana Bay Sands.

A Bucket List Hotel,Kirsten M,"Obviously MBS is expensive but if you can afford it, try to stay for at least one night while you're in Singapore. The view alone is amazing. The room itself was pretty standard although the bathroom was incredible with separate shower, huge bath, double sinks etc. If it is a special occasion, then be sure to tell the staff when you arrive or book.

Heaven on Earth,JoanneInverness,"My daughter was desperate to stay at this hotel during our stopover on the way back home from Brisbane as she'd seen it get built on a previous visit.   There's a danger with a hotel of this scale (it is huge) for it to be soulless and impersonal, but we didn't find that to be the case.  From the minute we stepped out of the taxi, the service was faultless (although pool service quite slow), but most importantly friendly and personal.   We were on the 18th floor with a garden view and what a view!   But of course, the main attraction is the rooftop infinity pool and it didn't disappoint.   Make sure you stick around for sunset and beyond - it's truly wonderful.  Getting sunbeds together was a bit tricky first thing as it's so busy, but it seems to be quite a transient clientele,…",5,January 2020,

This beautiful hotel divided into three wings is offering from high levels rooms to fantastic suites with breath taking views, to either sides of it, one overlooking the marina and the other overlooking the ocean. the pool on the top is definitely the attraction that gives this hotel it unique character and this is where most people want to spend their free time. surrounded with restaurants, bars and hot tubs the whole area is offering great atmosphere at all times. There are many other attractions like the huge shopping center, casino and more restaurants for fine dining of any kind.

A stunning hotel with top notch service,TravelbugBellevue_Wa,I didn’t expect too much from this hotel.  I figured since the Crazy Rich Asians movie featured the hotel it would be an overrated tourist attraction.  Wow!!! was I wrong.  This hotel is beautiful and provided top notch service.  The hotel responded professionally and promptly to all my hotel question.  We were served ice cream & water during the efficient & quick check in process.  We stayed 2 nights in a deluxe king sky view room.  Our room was spacious & modern with a seating area to enjoy the beautiful view.  The daytime city view was breathtaking and the nighttime view of the twinkling city lights was stunning.  We could even watch the nightly laser light show from our window.

One of a kind!,michaelc0459,"One of a kind hotel. For years I had seen the iconic pool on TV and magazines, so of course I had to stay here. During my 4-night trip to Singapore, I only stayed here for one night. I wanted to splurge, so I went all out and booked a room on the executive floor. I had expedited check in and was able to get into my room a few hours earlier than standard check in time.  The hotel itself is enormous, which comes with the good and the bad. The good is that there are plenty of restaurants, places to explore and things to do. The bad is that it is very difficult to offer top quality service when there are so many guests. This is a nice hotel but do not expect to get the same level of service as you would at Mandarin Oriental or Raffles. However, I must say the service in the…",5,December 2019,
Fantastic hotel. I thought it was hotel heaven,David,"The staff, the rooms, the service all were a 10 out of 10.   And yes it is even more spectacular than you can imagine.

Stunning views and good service,Docklander,The room was spotless and benefited from a good sized balcony. Very friendly staff. Our deal included breakfast which gives a choice of three restaurants. Rise gives you the better breakfast but Spago has the views but also a queue. We stayed in a garden view room. Great views of the gardens by the bay. There is a very busy road in front of the hotel so sitting out on the balcony was noisy so if you want a garden view room go for a high floor. The hotel is attached to a luxurious shopping centre with expensive food options but there is a food court.,4,January 2020,
On cloud 9,Simona M,Back to MBS after 5 years. Location always very glam and crowded. Prices increased compared to the past. Deluxe room with city view for 2 nights in early Jan costed about 1400 euro without breakfast. Hotel was fully booked apparently.The place is worth its money just because of the infinity pool and the extraordinary bay view from its top.The bed is a bid too hard for me and at the 38 floor you could still hear the noise of the cars down the busy street. If you do not intend to go to the pool maybe you ‘d better consider your choice. The place is huge.,4,January 2020,
No words!,preetisv,"Must visit to complete your Singapore itinerary even if it’s for a day. Gorgeous rooms, awesome view from balcony. Breathtaking view from the top floor....nothing can beat it. Infinity pool was a super hit for non swimmers like me too!! Hospitality is beyond words. Breakfast and dinner spread are splendid.  These guys could really teach hospitality to all!  Easily connected to all attractions.  Facility to store your luggage while you enjoy the day after you check out.  Expensive but worth every penny.",5,October 2019,
Nice hotel but severely lacking in service,,"I’ll begin by saying this is not a luxury hotel by any means. Overall the hotel is beautiful, the architecture inside and out is astounding and the surrounding area is immaculate. They rooms are OK, kinda dated and nothing special. The service level is very poor and had made for the worst hotel stays I have ever had. Especially for the steep rate.   Furthermore, if you are coming for the pool, forget it. The pool is far too overcrowded and quite filthy. Certainly not a pleasant experience even though the view is quite epic.   Elaborating on my service experience. Firstly, the amount of personnel on site is severely lacking. It is challenging to find anyone to assist you with even just a simple question.

Next Level Glam,Anthony,"Everything about this trip was amazing. I had heard the check in process was difficult, but that was not at all our experience. We arrived early, and our room was ready. They quickly brought up our bags. Our room’s views (Sky level room) of the city and the bay were magnificent. The building seemed to go on forever with shopping, a casino, dozens of restaurants, and the Bayfront metro stop all accessible without ever going outside! But nothing compares to the pool! Those 680 ft views absolutely take your breath away. We stayed nine nights in all, and it was a dream. We have not stopped dreaming about our trip since and plan to go back ASAP.",5,June 2019,

From the moment you arrive your luggage is whisked away only to be renunited with you as you enter your room and no bell boy awaiting a tip! Reception is vast and more like Grand Central Station with the continuous buzz of people checking in or out  no matter what time of day and people just wandering in to awe at the place. I was allocated a premier room on the 8th floor my friends were on the 30th floor.

We arrived around 7AM and the staff was nice enough to give us an early check-in; the room was ready with our luggages at 10AM. The location was very convenient for us because it was right next to Gardens at the Bay and the Artscience museum is a one minute walk from the mall connected to the hotel. Unfortunately, we came during new year time and the price was extremely expensive. I can't remember spending so much for one night except at hot springs ryokans in Japan with full kaiseki dinner.

Fabulous even when busy,Mellfell21,"Stayed for three nights as part of a 10 day trip & wish we'd stayed longer as we missed it immediately. I thought it would be hell on earth but it was the complete opposite. For such a busy destination hotel, with the choice of restaurants & bars, the intimacy & the service we received was not diminished in any way.  We loved the breakfast buffet at Rise & cocktails in the evening in the lounge. The pool area was busy as you'd expect at Christmas but young children are kept to one end of the pool which works well for everyone else! The pool food & drink service was fantastic.  Our large room overlooking the spectacular gardens & harbour easily accommodated the three of us & felt like a suite. Housekeeping was unobtrusive.

Luxury,Bilge,Welll Singapore is an expensive place and ofc here is expensive too. This is orginally a hotel but there is a mall downstairs. This mall is for only luxury shops.

There is a skybar in the hotel but I am not sure if they are open for only guests or people from outside.,4,December 2019,
Club Access is King!,Mister Perfect,"Our family of four had a wonderful one night stay in the Grand Club King room (garden view).  We were in Tower 2 (same as Club 55) on the 29th floor.  We made the most of our day.  Scored an early check-in at 10:30am and was in the pool by 11:30am.  We had a snack at the pool followed by afternoon tea 2pm, canapés and happy hour at 6pm, and breakfast at Rise (excellent pastrami and lox) the following morning.  Club 55 is high up on the 55th floor with great views and service.  Highly recommended to get a room with club access.  It's actually a good value since you get three meals (including a nice happy hour) and you save time not hunting around for restaurants to eat in. Worth a splurge.

Hence, I feel I need to share my experience.  We arrived at Marina Bay Sands after an awesome celebration of our 20th wedding anniversary at the Centara Resort in Maldives, hoping our celebration would continue but as soon as we walked into the door we were treated like cattle moved around for almost an hour to check in despite booking Club Room for 4 nights!

Really excellent hotel,2800PDA,"I was on the 43rd floor with ocean view. When you get into the room inserting your room card, room curtain automatically opens, which by itself was sufficient to make you feel good about staying at the hotel. It is a huge hotel; but I didn’t feel too much stress from long walking or any other inconvenience as it was probably well designed. The Gardens by the Bay was attached to the Hotel. The night view of the Gardens was also impressive. ",5,January 2020,

In the room there were bath robes and slippers which you were allowed to wear up to the pool. A plentiful supply of bottled water was provided every day. There was a fridge with a space for personal use you could use (though don't remove any of their stuff from fridge otherwise you'll be charged).

ICONIC LANDMARK HOTEL,Gr8nzgirl,We stayed one night at  Marina Bay Sands on 30th November 2019.after our cruise.  We were given an early check in as our ship disembarkation was at 08.00 hours (the Cruise Terminal is only minutes away from MBS)  We were given a late next day check out free of charge by the MBS duty manager.  Due to an approx 5-6 hour delay with our luggage being delivered to our room after arrival (this worked out perfectly as we had an evening departure flight)  We had a beautiful room on the 13th floor with amazing night views of the city of Singapore.  The iconic Infinity Pool did not disappoint and the pool service was 1st class.  We would highly recommend this hotel if you visit Singapore,5,November 2019,
Good experience but not 5 star,Saz,"If you’re in Singapore it’s worth splashing out and staying here for a night or two to enjoy the rooftop infinity pool as it really is an amazing experience. The views are wonderful (I’d recommend going for a swim and enjoying the city view after dark as well as during the day to experience both). Realistically the MBS is an instagram destination so expect a lot of tourists posing for photos at every corner of the pool/rooftop area but that’s just the age we live in. The rooms are great and the room views are spectacular, especially if you’ve a room with a view of the gardens.   Where the hotel falls short is the situation with the lifts/elevators.

It's the little things....,SCSW-Simon,"Had first two nights of an 8 day stay in Singapore at Marina Bay and biggest regret is that west after there instead of finishing. It earns its 5 stars well and truly, but it lets itself down with some of the little things. We booked for 3 (wife, myself and 13yo daughter) but our room only came with a King Bed. We needed to have a rollaway bed but at a cost of $100 a night. We asked for the bed to go straight to our room but 4 hours later and still had not arrived. It took two more calls to eventually have it delivered. We had breakfast up at Spargos on the pool deck (Level 57) and could not have been happier.  The room was nice but cramped with the rollaway bed.  Staff were excellent.  They did take almost an hour to find our bags when we came to collect them post-check out.…",4,December 2019,

Kinda Las Vegas in Singapore,Jeff O,"MBS is a must see for anyone visiting Singapore. Have to do it at least once. Sky park and pool are amazing attraction.

Amazing hotel fantastic views 5***** service,Alex S,"We stayed at the Marina bay in October for 2 night in a club room 46th floor overlooking the gardens. Room as very nicely furnished as was the bathroom well laid out separate shower room and toilet. Bath in the major part of the bathroom. We were in the second tower so the clubroom 55 was easily accessible just a few floors up in the lift. Staff were very attentive and friendly food was very nice and a good selection to drink.  We ate breakfast, afternoon tea and early dinner in the club room well worth paying the upgrade. The infinity pool is well worth a visit day and night for the views. Pool slightly crowded but that is the main attraction of staying in this hotel.

Huge ❣️❣️,TBE,Seriously huge place!! Amazing architecture. Never ending designer shopping. Love the gondolas. Love the open air fountain. No shortage of things to do and see.  Observation Deck worth a visit for that top of the world experience. As far as a hotel goes a little overwhelming- so many people checking in and out. Queues never ending. Says something for smaller boutique accommodation.,5,September 2019,
Best Hotel in Singapore,Stelios M,"Our room was spacious, with great view and every comfort needed. Swimming at the the infinity pool was great experience. The stuff was very polite and professional. It is not an economical option though.",5,August 2019,
Not worth the price,Carolina P,"Pool is amazing. No one can deny this. And yes, it's worth to stay ONE night just for the pool. But the rest, oh the rest...Rooms on the 2nd floor get all the noise from the road, although it's the same price as a room on the 9th floor. Amenities in the room are limited, for example there is no bluetooth speaker if you want to listen to your music.  Bathroom: no privacy here. Toilet is together with sink and shower, door is a sliding door that doesnt lock or shut properly (yes, you can hear everything and even look inside the bathroom when door is ""closed""). When you have a shower the bathroom will get flooded since there is no enclosed shower. Staff in reception are nice during check in and rude during check out. The hotel overall is foccused in chinese clients which means is…",2,December 2019,
Flawless,Thais Tramontina,"Absolutely flawless hotel! Stayed in a family room, with other 3 people. The room was huge and amusing. 2 bathrooms and an enormous balcony. The pool on the 57th floor dismisses any comment: INCREDIBLE! If you have the opportunity to go when you are in Singapore, don’t miss it!",5,December 2019,
Wonderful Hotel,aks120LasVegas,We stayed here for 2 nights and loved every minute of it!  Check in was quite quick and we got our room early.  The twin room was big with a great view over the city.  The beds were a touch hard for my liking but other than that I loved the room.  The bathroom was nice and big - in fact huge with a separate shower and roll top bath.  The amenities were of high quality and the hairdryer was really food.  The hotel itself is huge - very similar to Vegas hotels (which I love) with a lot going on.  Lots of bars and restaurants to visit - the casino is not great - we didn’t stay long.  It is also attached to a shopping mall and is very close to the Gardens by the Bay - a great location all round.  The pool - well that is quite magnificent - not too busy as you can only get in as a…,5,December 2019,
"A ""Bucket List"" thing!",Keith B,"It is worth noting that this is not just a hotel but more of a principle tourist attraction for Singapore. Therefore, it is always very busy and lacks the peace and quiet you might expect from a 5-star hotel.  That said, as a unique experience, it is worth a stay here to be able to sample the 57th-floor pool and facilities for yourself.  Certainly, this did not disappoint and even though the weather was cloudy it was still an amazing experience to lounge by the pool in very pleasant temperatures in December. The overall size of the place does mean you can find as much action or peace as suits your preference. The room we had on the 20th floor was well furnished and very spacious with a large well-equipped bathroom area with robes and slippers useful for the pool area. Wifi…",4,December 2019,
Amazing Views.....,Jonnyhague1,"Paid €22 including a drink, absolutely loved it. Staff were great, views amazing. Was all very easy, taxi dropped us at the door, no queues, went straight to the 57th floor. Highly Recommended, will re visit.",5,December 2019,
More than just a swimming pool?,Yarra64,"This place is about the pool.  I’ve stayed here several times because of it.  It’s amazing.    However, on a rainy day that’s where the positives end.    It’s a massive hotel, service is pleasant but not personal, there are many rules, many things this hotel can’t do.  Not a lot of flex on late checkouts, can’t use the pool or showers if you have a late afternoon flight.  The rooms are beginning to show signs of a lack of maintenance (we couldn’t turn off lights, nor could the staff sent to fix it).   The buffet breakfast is like everything else a dazzling array of everything you could ever want but much of it pretty mediocre in quality.  In the end, it’s really expensive for what it is and there are many other high end properties in Singapore that just do it better at a way…",2,December 2019,
ELEVATOR MISPHAP AND COLD POOL WATER,stephenhQ9849EH,"I booked a two night stay and and ""meet and greet."" The meet and greet was excellent and got me through the airport smoothly late at night. At the hotel, however, the elevator in Tower No. 3 got stuck between floor number 2 and 7 and kept jerking us up and down. I was so jet-lagged that it didn't affect me as much as the porter who was carrying my bags. He started to freak out and got on the phone with security. I had an excellent view of the arboretum in my room and enjoyed everything except the reason I came to this hotel--the rooftop infinity pool. It was freezing cold so you couldn't really try it out. The last time I was in Singapore I stayed at Raffles and the pool was outstanding--you couldn't even tell the difference between the air temperature and the water as you…",3,December 2019,
Excellent!,Simon Hoon,Stayed for a 2-night trip in a Deluxe room sky view. The room is super spacious with amazing view of the skyline and harbourfront. Good selection of amenities from their own brand. The staff at reception and roomservice was really helpful and efficient considered the business and size of the hotel. Would love to come back again for a couple of nights.,5,May 2019,
Just for the view,Mi autour du monde,"The swimming pool with the highest entrance fee in the world! The view from the top is unbeatable. But the pool is very quickly crowded with lots of other people who want just the same as you, take a photo from the top! We had a room with ""sky"" view on the 42nd floor (view of the city, but higher up), and the view was wow! Yes, the room was huge and comfortable, but overall the hotel lacks the chic and character of other luxury hotels and feels like a big bling factory. Lobby is huge and crowded, badly signed. The wait for check in was approx 30min!",3,December 2019,
Wow!,matt2lee,"Wow. Yes, what a treat it is to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. If you’re going to splurge at a hotel on a stay in Singapore, this is the place to do it as our entire family was able to get a 2 bedroom suite here.  We didn’t know we were going to get upgraded to a nice suite as the hotel seemed so busy! Check in reminded me of checking into a hotel in Hawaii where it is so chaotic with kids running around the check in area with a line zig zagging. However the hotel check in staff were very friendly and pleasant and were very sincere and appreciative of their guests waiting in line (they even have someone standing throughout the queue passing out water bottles).  The hotel has 3 towers. We stayed in tower 2. Each tower usually has 3 sets of lifts - one for floors 1-24 or half of…",5,December 2019,
Just Do It!,Larry L,"My partner and I, with friends, recently stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel during a pre-cruise stay.   It really is fun to stay here: the Marina Bay Sands (with its malls, restaurants, nearby gardens, and casino) has become the touristic heart of Singapore and its wonderful to be in the center of the action.  The hotel is a design icon, the rooms are very very nice (good size and lots of amenities) and the service was quite good for a mega hotel....is it the most luxurious hotel in Singapore or does it offer the best service?  Probably not, but this is hotel is about being where the action in.    We enjoyed access to the famous roof top pool and took an early morning swim - its actually quite peaceful in the morning hours; later on, its a mad house, but what would you expect?…",5,December 2019,
Bucket list.....divine,928charmainep,"We spent 3 nights at MBS...everything we expected, wow factor  ,wonderful staff . This hotel has a shopping centre second to none. There is an amazing food court which is really reasonable.  MBS is all about location, close to Gardens at the Bay, the life science museum, a walk from the Merlion across the bay. The city view is spectacular with a lights and lazer show every evening 7pm and 8pm...beautiful.  The infinity pool on the 57th floor is incredible. Our room was really spacious. Best treat being on the club level was at 5pm every evening till 7pm you can have drinks and delicious hot snacks on the 55th floor. Amazing view of the ocean...loved it. Thank you for a memorable holiday experience MBS  fulfilled all bucket list expectations ",5,December 2019,
Stay during Christmas,CamillaDemuth,"The hotel was fine, I loved the pool and the view from the pool area. The suites - Orhid, was ok, but unpersonal and need an update. The club on 55 was nice, vert good service. You should eat your breakfast here, during high seson, you Will have to queue to get breakfast on the other restaurants.",4,December 2019,
Very unique hotel,Jessica,"This hotel was massive in terms of its foot print in the lower level shopping and dining areas. Very interesting and one of a kind experience. The rooftop infinity pool is the main attraction, along with the rooftop bars. The only thing is, as other reviewers said, it’s not the most classy experience at the pool... it’s packed. And the rooftop bar Ce La Vie does not have the best setup. There are cocktail bar seats at the perimeter of the glass, which boast the best views, but these are always occupied by people who are frequently just sipping on a single drink. In other rooftop bars we have been to, there are rarely seats along the perimeter, but rather standing room only and some seats scattered in the interior. This would drive bar sales and also allow more people to enjoy…",3,December 2019,
"Yes, it is THE place to make a great picture ...",Magnapurga,"... but the price you'll pay is big, and we are not only talking about the money. For most guests, it seems that the rooftop pool is the mair reason to stay here. This results not only in a crowded terrace, let alone the pool, but also in a less-than-classy experience. Smell of french fries everywhere, fights for sunbeds and other small pleasures guaranteed. The room itself was OK, no extras. The service went smoothly. Best place to book seems to be the hotel's own website.",3,August 2019,
Luxurious hotel with great facilities,Jayne W,Hotel and the complex around it are amazing. Would only recommend for one or two nights just to experience it. Very very busy all the time and full of people with so much money they don’t know what to do with it. All obsessed with selfies and posting to social media (especially in the pool). Pool is great for novelty factor and views but freezing cold and always busy with posers and pouters! Family studio was very spacious and well equipped. Lower floors only though so no views and road noise on balcony almost unbearable.  Mini bar is locked and you have to hire a fridge if you want to chill drinks.  Very clean and well furnished.  Bathroom spacious and clean. Beds and pillows not that comfortable. Air con ridiculously noisy.,4,December 2019,
Nice infrastructure. Must visit,Prerit M,"The infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was obviously the first thing I thought of, as it’s probably the most iconic and romantic attraction of the Lion City. ... Visitors can only enter Marina Bay Sands SkyPark to get to the observation deck. If you want to access & dive in infinity pool you must be in house guest.",5,December 2019,

Overrated,Annmarie L,"Stayed in room 925 on December 22. I have to say our stay gave us an over whelming feeling of disappointment. For the massive amount of money we paid for a night stay, the service was beyond disappointing. As soon as we got in, we wanted to make a celebratory cocktail as we were staying for my partners birthday. The only way to get ice is to have it delivered to the room. No problem. We called, and waited 30 mins- still no ice. Called again and waited another 20 minutes when finally 2 buckets of ice arrived. By then we really just wanted to get upstairs to the pool as the room itself was really nothing special. Our experience at the pool was very unfortunate.

Luxury with close by attractions,L2912UBs,"Where to start? there’s a lot to know.  Easy by taxi from Changi airport. Alternatively MRT isn’t far away or ferry terminal is a little further but you can walk to.  Located downtown of city centre it boasts looking at city lights with beautiful reflection off water. If you prefer a sea view that too is available, or perhaps to view the infamous gardens by the bay.  Hotel is extremely busy. For travellers flying long distance, you can register early at checkin and if allowed, a pool key provided for that day. Stow your change of clothes in gym/sauna change room level 55 until room is available.  Upon checkout you can’t get pool extension but they can offer use of showers and change room on level 55.

Worth the Price of Admission,hoyasaxa90,"Recently stayed at MBS prior to a cruise that kicked off in Singapore.  Attentive service from the moment we arrived to the hotel. Doormen, front desk, concierge, everyone was beyond helpful and efficient.  Upgraded to a fantastic family suite that had amazing views of the city.  The Infinity Pool on the top floor is a must visit, especially at night for pictures.  Don’t forget the evening light shows, both are only minutes away by foot.

The Disneyland of hotels,withfreshlime,"My family loves staying here because it has an amazing infinity pool, is walking distance to attractions, and has easy to access MRT and taxis. It all facilities we need and the service is consistently very good. However, on our recent visit we noticed the rooms are starting to get a little shabby (for example a light switch got stuck 'on'). Also, when the weather is not great for swimming or when you would like the option to use hotel facilities (the pool and gym) for free after check-out /before a late flight - it is not the best option. In future we will carefully consider recent reviews and other hotel options before booking",4,December 2019,
"Excellent place, but very expensive",RSTT,"The good:  -	There is a reason why this is one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore! The staff, facilities and room were fantastic. If you can afford it, stay here and get into that infinity pool at least once in your lifetime.  -	The location is very central and with the MRT station just downstairs, you have train access to so many places in Singapore. Or, walk to Singapore’s Civic District and its many historical and entertainment spots.  -	The views at the top floor are amazing!  The not-so-good:  -	Everything in this place is expensive. The cheapest food options here are at the food court which serves so-so food at very expensive prices. It’s almost $10 per dish (like chicken rice or Hokkien noodles)! Add in beverages and you’re looking at over $10 per meal. The nearest…",5,December 2019,
Beautiful and expensive,bodipo8,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights and had a fantastic time! Amazing views, food and service. Stayed on the 36th floor which had a balcony with an awesome view over the bay and the Garden. The room itself is decent - same with the bathroom, but the hotel room itself is not worthy of the price.

MY STAY AT THE MARINA BAY SANDS,Meet Gandecha,"I would say that this hotel would be a once in a lifetime wish to stay in as this hotel has all of the luxuries you would ask for from a 5 star hotel and the staff of the hotel from the housekeeping to the express service in room service to the entire support staff in the hotel all of them are very kind, polite and helpful in their own profession. The infinity pool is the the main attraction in the hotel and the best thing is that you need your hotel room key card to access the pool and the skypark and each person has to carry their own keycard which is good security wise and privacy wise.

Position and bustle,Astrid R,"Check in and check out were remarkably swift amidst the bustle of this enormous hotel. The staff were excellent. Our room had stunning views of the Bay Gardens, harbour and for plane spotters a good view (with binoculars) of the busy airport. The room however was looking a bit lack lustre and the mattress was uncomfortable. We did appreciate the large balcony. We only ate once in the hotel - at the bar on the pool level. The high price of the (snack sized) food and extremely high price of alcoholic beverages ensured we did not return. It was very noisy. The adjacent shopping centre is only for those with a designer budget although there are good food outlets and the art and science museum is well worth a visit. The Bay Gardens are magnificent, especially in December with the…",3,December 2019,

It was funny to watch people trying to get the perfect selfie - girls in full makeup , trendy sunnies and stilettos. we wondered how many phones have been dropped in that pool? Towels were still warm and staff were friendly and attentive. The breakfast at pool level was beautiful.",5,December 2019,
Not as great as expected,Wanderlustelyse,"Okay, let me begin with the positives. The staff we encountered were fantastic and incredibly friendly and really made it a great stay. The views from both the pool and city view rooms are incredible and I could stare at the view forever. As for the room itself, the beds are comfortable and the room is a good size, with a huge bathroom including a full size bath.  What I was probably most disappointed in was the pool. Now don't get me wrong, the view was worth it, but the pool was so cold that it made it almost impossible to stay in for too long. I came from a european winter holiday and the pool felt colder than standing outside without a jacket and thermals on.

Reception was fairly quiet and thus we were checked in and on our way upstairs within 5 minutes; nice and easy.   Having booked a standard room we were informed during check-in that we were upgraded to a family room; unsure why but no complaints.  Room was on the back side of the hotel overlooking ‘Gardens by the Bay’, on the 5th floor of Tower 1.

It’s all about the pool & the view :-),Donna,"This hotel reminded us of a Vegas hotel, it’s big, in your face and busy. The turnover of rooms is huge and it’s not somewhere you go too to relax - it’s an experience hotel. If is of course all about the pool and the view and to be fair neither disappoint - though the pool was FREEZING! Was great to sit and have a drink at night over-looking this exceptional place and also people watch - it is the place to be seen. Our room was nice but almost an after-thought. It’s not the greatest hotel we have stayed in here however we are glad we did, just to experience it all.

Our room had a great view of the Gardens at the bay (well worth a visit) & the harbour. It was spacious, clean & quiet.

From the check in till check out, this was a great stay.  The lobby is beautiful and the staff very welcoming.  When we walked into our room on the 20th floor, we were amazed at how big the room actually was. It was also well-equipped with wine glasses and other things provided already. And the view of the Gardens By The Bay was outstanding!  The infinity pool is what we were there for, but the room surprised us.  The pool itself is something to be experienced, there's no way to describe what it's like. I would recommend going there around 5pm for a swim and staying until about 7:30 - watching the sun go down and the buildings lighting up around the hotel is a beautiful experience. It wasn't…",5,November 2019,
Fantastic Hotel,Chriss B,"Where to start with this leviathan of a hotel?  Three towers, around 20 Resturants, an a gazillion things to do! This is one of the best hotels i ever stayed in. Off course the people make the place and here in MBS there is an eclectic bunch of super-friendly  and helpful staff to make your stay the best it possibly can be. With 6 celebrity restaurants, bars and cafes everywhere and the worlds biggest roof top infinity pool, plus the giant mall, the laser fountain, science museum, theatre and casino, you could spend your entire holiday in singapore just in this hotel Tip 1:  get a “City view” room.  You can see the fountain show and the canal boats and the city skyline is breathtaking. Tip 2: this hotel is vast. If you are going to meander around the mall you take the main…",5,December 2019,
"Great views, terrible service",MsDisraeli,"We weren't impressed with our stay here. The welcome at the front desk was abysmal, not even a 'Welcome to MBS, we hope you enjoy your stay' - more like 'Here's your key. Head that way'. The service during our stay just continued in the same vein, with no one being particularly helpful or friendly. You're just paying for the views and that rooftop pool access - which are spectacular, in fairness. But when we stay at a luxury 5 star hotel we expect service to match the pricetag. The room decor felt dated - beige and beige - and tired, with a stain on one of the pillows. We would not stay again or recommend it to friends and family.",3,September 2019,
Marina Bay Sands,Robin M,You won’t get a better view of Singapore than the one from the Marina Bay Sands! Whether you choose the observation deck or the bar the views are incredible! The MBS complex also features world class dining and shopping so plan to spend some time taking in all the activities!,5,December 2019,
Awesome experience,Celina,"This was my first time in Singapore. We decided to stay at the marina bay sands. Expensive, but worth every penny. It’s another world. It’s a big hotel (more than 2000 guests). Very clean and plenty things to do.",5,December 2019,
Sightseeing,Rainey,What a magnificent hotel you find yourself constantly looking at it from all directions. It is attached to a shopping centre by an underground pass located next to the gardens by the bay and the art and science museum. Loads to do in the area. You can go to the top to get the views costs $25 which includes one cocktail but only worth it if clear sky as expensive but definitely an experience,4,December 2019,
Weekday staycation,Tiramissyou,Room is nice and clean in 3086. I love my stay. Called the operator for a HDMI cable which was delivered rather quickly but the opening and closing speech of the call was alittle too long for my liking. Same for breakfast where I was greeted in a rather extensive manner. MBS really puts in alot of effort towards staff training which is amazing. Pancakes at lvl 57 during breakfast was my favourite. Staff at this restaurant are so energised early in the morning and they approach me like we are already friends. Its refreshing to feel this way. Mrt station is just round the corner from tower one and I got to my office in suntec very quickly. Its convenient^^  A small point which I dont quite like is the room's toilet flush button. Its blocked by the seat cover you really gotta reach…,5,December 2019,
Everything I expected and more!,Aungelique,"I recently celebrated my 40th birthday by taking a trip to Singapore and Bali. Like most people I wanted to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Simply so I could enjoy being in the rooftop infinity pool. My trip to Singapore with amazing, and my stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was incredible. One of the penthouse suites with available that weekend and the hotel generously upgraded us to a 2 bedroom penthouse completely free of charge! I probably shouldn’t have started there, LOL, but that in itself made my trip exceptionally amazing. While waiting in a very long line to check in hotel staff came around offering cold bottles of water, cold bottles A freshly squeezed fruit juice, as well as ice cream snacks while we waited to check in. The hotel compound itself is very similar to what…",5,October 2019,
Centrally located with many amenities,jeannaoh,"Big hotel like those in Las Vegas. It is a city by itself with many nice restaurants & fancy shops. But, it has a nice food court for tourists to try local food. It has lots of amenities for all ages, its main attraction is the Casino & Infinity Pool. Too crowded for my liking.",4,November 2019,
Worth it!,Kay P,"Stayed here for two nights to enjoy the pool and city views. It was amazing!! The service was excellent and concierge service was great. Only complaint was that there was no fresh milk in the room which I found a little bizarre and only one of each tea, so if two people like English breakfast tea, you’d have to call reception lol. Otherwise, I would totally recommend staying here for at least one night if you’re visiting Singapore to enjoy the amenities (pool, sky deck etc) and to have a look around the marina bay area + gardens by the bay.",5,November 2019,
6 star service,Apreal,"Working in a hospitality industry I expect more when it comes to service and amenities,and this hotel exceeded my expectations. From our smooth check in assist by Mark who is very professional to the Inroom Dining service by Angelica who is very friendly. We will definitely comeback and stay again. Salute to housekeeping as well for clean rooms. It was a great and unforgettable stay🙌🏻",5,December 2019,
Amazing experience.,Xiaolio,"There are USB plug on each side of the beds, bathroom is huge, room is very spacious, clean.   We got a room on 47th floor,  ake up in the morning with the view... just breathtaking and you can see the lights from the garden at night, it was so perfect..",5,December 2019,
Must see view from the top,nlsmiley4,"Excellent views of Singapore. Instead of paying to get to the top, go to the roof top bar for a drink. It is free with the purchase of a drink rather than paying the $20 to visit the observation deck.",5,November 2019,
Superb hotel & service second to none,Andytravel2015,"When we were checking in at Marina Bay Sands for a 2 night stay we were asked by Mei at front desk if we were celebrating something special.  We mentioned that it was our 30th wedding anniversary & Mei offered us a free grade that was beyond belief. We were given a suite that was 3,552 sqft instead of 2 separate rooms and it was simply amazing. This sort of room is for celebrities & one percenters. It was on 51st floor with floor to ceiling windows with beautiful views of Singapore.  Suite had a media room, massage table, exercise Bike & an awesome living/ dining room with a baby grand piano. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was amazing, the gym on the 55th floor was very good. Breakfast buffet was extensive & delicious. Shopping & dining in the building were abundant & it…",5,November 2019,
amazing views,Anilah11,"The very modern luxury hotel with breathtaking views from the upper floors. Rooms are large, comfortable bed, nice bathroom. Very clean everwhere. The must is the rooftop swimming poolrestanrants an bars. The pool is overcrowded, so if you like company and loud music this is the place to be. Nice place for the photos.",5,November 2019,
"Birthday stay. Very disappointed, 
DON’T Bother",Ahimsa1,"We came to Marina bay with high expectations and also emailed multiple times again to make sure vegan options were offered at dining locations before booking. We were staying here for my husbands 50th and got two club rooms.   First off, this is a nice hotel and the rooftop pool is lovely. Unfortunately that's about it.   Staff: We found all staff rude and unhelpful. When we asked for drinks or food it took forever and not what we asked for.   Check in: we arrived early and were able to drop our bags early and enjoy the pool on the rooftop while we waited on our room. We dined at Spago for breakfast and we're advised they had vegan options.. I don't call some fruit and juice opinions... Very very dissatisfied and angry to be honest. I told the waiters and they did offer to cook…",1,November 2019,
Great hotel. Good service,Mike,"Stayed for a few days and thoroughly enjoyed. First time in Singapore and it is ideally located for the Gardens (walk across the bridge) and metro /underground and shopping.  Infinity pool is great fun. Can be busy from opening at 6am but with high turnover - few people seemed to stay all day so always beds available. Restaurants at peak times for breakfast were busy but Staff managed will and queue processed efficiently. Good large selection at breakfast. Booked limo service and were met at air bridge as you come off plane and escorted through (not fast lane) all the way to limo. Met at MBS front door (make sure you know which Tower) and did check-in in the room.Nice touch I've not had before (depends what room you book!). Huge,busy hotel with all the positives and negatives. ",5,November 2019,
Outstanding experience,Daliana D,"Everything was spectacular at Marina Bay Sands, the staff, the room, the incredible construction itself and of course the infinity pool. We visited Singapore in September due to my birthday and Formula 1 race and I have to admit that is was the best way celebrating myself. Their lovely staff offered me a room with the amazing Gardens by the bay view. The entire experience was an outstanding one and I will never forget it.",5,September 2019,
I agree with singbob!,LondonWiggies,"Totally agree with the previous savvy reviewer  If you want to get the best out of this institution then you’ve got to divi up and you’ve got to plan ahead  We paid a bit more for a higher up room overlooking gardens by the bay and cracked open the [not stupidly expensive] half bottle of bubbly while we watched the free light show from our balcony  We’d booked Cest la vie rooftop restaurant - stunning view, great table, lovely food and drink and great service- very funky vibe- great atmosphere- really exciting, special  We were invited unexpectedly to visit the night club, but my sandals didn’t pass the dress code - my fault- previous research had highlighted that- no worries  We woke early and went straight up to the THAT signature rooftop pool - there was only a few guests up…",5,September 2019,
Amazing looking hotel,JanetTaylorHerts,"Wow what a hotel The Marina Bay Sands is, so impressive. We were unable to go to the top as we weren’t guests and they charged £26 pp to visit, rediculous. We walked around the gardens & saw the canopied trees & various art works scattered through the gardens. ",5,November 2019,
Outstanding and great service,S0much2cN2liltym,Was here for conference and completely blown away. This place is ALWAYS busy. Room view of city was stunning. Could watch light show. Tried sunrise yoga on observation deck. Really good but note not the strenuous type- more beginner level and stretching with few poses.   Also a HUGE thank you to the amazing staff especially the supervisor (the very  helpful Malaysian gentleman) who went out of his way to help my boyfriend when his AirPods dropped into the drain while queuing for breakfast up on L55. Can’t thank you enough.,4,December 2019,
"Fabulous hotel, great rxperience",Drakesy,"We loved our stay here, on arrival the staff were very helpful and this continued through the stay. The rooftop is incredible with its bars, restaurants and of course the Infinity Pool. This just gives great views across Singapore. The hotel is in a great location as well. ",5,November 2019,
You have to pay up to get value,SingBob,"Its definitely got a wow factor, but you need to pay for a better room to get the effect.   The cheaper rooms can feel quite cramped and those on lower floor have a resticted view. If you are in the Tower with the cheaper rooms you might find yourself in a queue just to reach the lifts. Not good as youll still be paying a fortune.  I suspect the cheaper rooms mostly go to package tourists - cannon fodder for the casino dowstairs. Notable as the only aircon-ed public space where its legal to smoke in Singapore apart from the other casino.  If you are booking yourself I'd advise go for a bigger room on a higher floor.I had a Premier King City View and despite the fittings being a little uninspired the view through the floor to ceiling windows more than made up for it.  And you'll…",5,November 2019,

5 Stars For Valerie,Nancy B,"We know that the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is a five start hotel, and justly deserved. However, today we encountered a five star representative at the check in desk, Valerie. Even though the airline lost two of our luggage pieces, she was able to soothe our frustration with the airline. She remained poised, cheerful, and most importantly, presented five star service. If Marina Bay is ever going to make a commercial, Valerie should be featured! Truly wonderful.",5,November 2019,
luxurious property with so much to do arround,anish_gupta,"i stayed here for 2 days with my wife and my kid 10 years we just loved the property and cant get over amazing memories of our stay there. loved every second we spend in infinity pool , and than there amazing gym with wonderful view. loved the view of garden by the bay from our room. breakfast is superb , we  had over diet there ...lol shopping mall is superb .. u may spend hours there and than there casino is just wow in 1 word .... its huge and lots of options to put ur bet depending on how much you willing to loos ...lol and than there also art and science museum , my kid loved it  and not to be missed sunrise view from top the floor ... words not enough to explain how beautiful it is , in short stay in marina bay sands is worth every peny you spend.",5,March 2019,
Spectacular place to stay,Michael Franks,"Definitely worth staying for a night or two in Singapore. The infinity pool on the roof is spectacular, but not a place for swimming! Crowded and shallow but still a must. Rooms are very clean and tidy, staff are really good. It’s a big hotel with lots of people...would I stay there on another trip? Probably not and go for a more homely place.",5,November 2019,
First class all the way,jetters888,"Stayed here for one night to experience Marina Bay Sands and to be close to some attractions.  Stayed in the 47th floor.  The large room and the wall to ceiling city and bay view was simply incredible and beautiful.  The comfortable, contemporary and modern 400 sq ft plus room, could pass as a suite in other hotels.  There are many attractions around the hotel.  For one is the rooftop infinity pool.  You must be a guest at the hotel to access the pool.  Then there's the high-end shopping center and food court.  There's the popular Gardens by the Bay, the beautiful Cloud Forest,  Super Tree Gove, waterfront promenade and the famous Merlion.  You could easily spend a day in and around the hotel.  Finally, there's a porter by the name of Rami. He's one of the many friendly and…",5,October 2019,
Idyllic luxury but so chaotic,KevMac1960,"We stayed here for a special birthday celebration and it certainly was a treat. Paid for one of the rooms on a high floor so had a fantastic view. The room was exceptional and of course the sky park and infinity pool were stunning. However the organisation from arrival and parking, check in to check out was organisational chaos which kind of spoiled the stay.  To be fair they were giving out bottles of water to those waiting in the long lines to check in and check out if you are coming by car I recommend you use the valet parking because if not you have to walk for miles!!  I’m considering taking some of the family there next year so hopefully will be better organised",4,November 2019,
Service is Terrible,Brittany K,"Where do I start...  We requested two connecting rooms months ago for our large group. We were promised this could be accommodate over the phone at by the front desk the day of check-in.  Check-in at MBS is 3pm.  They were able to give us one of the two rooms we paid for but the connecting room was not available until 8:45pm.  Almost 5 hours later.    Additionally, our room key cards were a disaster.  After numerous sets of room keys, all 6 of our keys never work properly.  So every time we went to the pool, someone in our groups key card wouldn’t work.  Which must’ve triggered a breach in their systems and as a response, our room keys got deactivated. So after the pool we couldn’t use them to open our room.    And get this, housekeeping just woke us all up at 8am by ringing our…",1,November 2019,
Three days in Singapore,brett m,As part of our family Asian tour we started in Singapore and stayed at the MBS hotel Whilst the views and the top floor is stunning and gives great views of the gardens and the harbour the hotel is too large and this creates a manic environment  I liken it to being at a major hub airport too much bustling and people milling about  On the plus side the majority of the staff try there best to give customers that special individual treatment but in my opinion this is a difficult task  If u get the opportunity to go to the top viewing gallery then it’s a must . Drink prices aren’t cheap and the food in the restaurant is average with service that could be improved   I didn’t even go into the infinity swimming pool as it was packed and with that many people in it we’ll need I say more…,5,November 2019,
Fantastic,Arne Birkeland,Great check inn and fantastic area. The pool is a must and one of the most fantastic experiences. The rooms are great and clean. The food is fantastic. The service is high and smiling. Highly recommended,5,December 2018,
Stunning. Though a few hiccups at the start.,laurabalmerholiday,"The hotel is every inch as staggering and stunning as you think it will be. The pool!!! Amazing. Our room on 26th floor was spacious and nice, though a little plain - the main attraction was the view of gardens by the bay. In the main staff were helpful and nice - extremely professional. Particular mention of Azan on concierge desk who was super helpful and kind.   We didn’t get off to the best start however. Flying in late from Sydney, we arrived at about 10pm, having booked and paid for a room for my husband and I and our son aged nearly 4, staying his age during booking via the marina bay sands website. On arrival and check in I asked whether the bed was already set up for our son. The receptionist said she would get a cot bought up for us. I stated he was too old and too…",4,November 2019,
Very impressive,TimeTravellers01,"It certainly is an iconic and marvellous hotel to stay in. The check in process was very smooth, the rooms were huge with great view - nice electric curtains etc. The sky pool is wonderful, what a great moment to enjoy the worlds tallest pool. However, it’s not 5 star because of these reasons.  1) I had previously told them we had a 3 year old and could they give a small bed for him. They forgot this; and then couldn’t but gave us a a cot. He stopped using a cot when he was 2 so we took mattress out and he slept on the floor on the mattress. Not ideal.  2) he had has Bday cake there and for about 2 days the cleaners left the cake and crumbs etc on the table. It was obvious I thought that we were done with it?! Further I had previously arranged cake and so on in the room for when…",4,November 2019,

The infinity pool on the 57th floor is the highlight of the hotel,kitty32655,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands because we wanted to use the infinity pool (which definitely lived up to our expectations). It's a spectacular view and a very special experience!! The architecture of the hotel is like nothing else and is stunning!!  Construction was going on during our visit, so we heard drilling for about 4 hours on our first day and then a couple of hours two days later. The room itself was okay. We had a premier room with a view of Gardens by the Bay so we could see the ""gardens"" light show from our balcony. There is also a light and water show on the marina side.

Excellent Team and Great Food!,TravelAndLeisure,"First of all, we would like to thanks MBS Team for such an excellent host for our short stay in Singapore. It was a memorable experience and will be forever remembered. The infinity pool was awesome!!! I would love to be back soon and enjoy my stay a little bit longer. And please extend my warm thank you to the Gordon Ramsay restaurant staff, especially to the reservation personnel Mark who made our reservation experience awesome in the restaurant!

Best birthday ever,afirdes,"After watching “Crazy Rich Asians” I always wanted to stay at this hotel and thought why not for my birthday which is the last night on my 6 week holiday around Asia. Let me tell you I was spoilt and I felt luxury, everything.  1. You get offered water/ orange juice when waiting in line to check in.  2. While your room is getting ready, you get to use the amazing infinity pool.  3. When I got an email saying my room is ready which was 3 hours before the actual check in time.  4. Came to a room with the view of the city and our suitcases.  5. I got a birthday cake sent to my room. 6. My friend and I ordered room service and they set the table up in front of the window.

Visit with 2 Thai visitors,Angela T,We had visited the Merlion and walked round half of Marina Bay to reach Marina Bay Sands to cross over to Gardens by the Bay.

Second visit.,Gazzi P,"We stayed here for the second time. The reception staff was very nice and friendly and she gave us a very nice room. However compared to 1.5 years ago I can see that the rooms are in need of a bit of renovation. The buttons on our safe was not working properly and compared to other 5 star hotels and resorts there are some stuff missing. For example the bathroom night light was not working. The room didn’t have international power converter. The view is very nice as always and the room gets cleaned nicely. The check in service is very attentive and good. The pool and the view from the pool is incredible. In overall except for some minor faults, we will come back and recommend this hotel. ",4,November 2019,
What a view,vinod b,"We went to see this magnificent place in the evening. The view was unbelievable from 57th floor. We decided to go the viewing platform instead of the restaurant as you can go near the edge of the platform and get a better view. You can go to the viewing platform from the basement and cost couple of dollars more. The view is unbelievable, the light show starts at 20:00 hours.",5,November 2019,
57th Floor!!!,clare66uk,"Stayed at MBS for a conference, it’s been on my bucket list for years & didn’t disappoint!!  Room was lovely, spacious - wonderful view across the bay.  Well worth getting up early to see the sunrise from the 57th floor & the stubby infinity pool!",5,November 2019,
Sublime experience with breathtaking views.,Sergi N,"We stayed there for only two nights because we were in a long trip and we didn't want to spend much in hotels, but we felt like if we stayed in Singapore, Marina Bay was a must. And we were totally right.   We decided to go for a room with views to the gardens, floor 49 and once we got there it was just incredible.   The rooms are normal for a 5 stars hotel, but it's more about the experience and of course, the pool!  The views from the infinity pool in the top present to you one of the best skylines that I have ever seen (comparable or even better to New York's one I would say!) and it's really chilled. If you go in a weekday it's not really crowded, and the fact that everyone will be at the edge taking pictures leaves the rest of the pool for those who just want to enjoy the…",5,October 2019,
1 Night in Heaven,WorldTravla7,"I splashed out and booked a night at MBS (one of the most famous hotels in the world and on most top 10 lists) and would do it again in a heartbeat. Here’s the highlights:  - Infinity Pool on L57. The giant pool lying across the 3 towers of MBS is world famous and totally amazing. The views are out of this world, you’re relaxed and the pool is exclusive to hotel guests. I felt like a king looking out on my kingdom, ruling Singapore from the skies. Amazing. I went in 3 times during my stay and night time was the best. They gave me 2 keycards so I was able to take a friend from Singapore up with me.

This complex has everything from indoor (and underground) boat rides, to a Casino, countless coffee shops, restaurants, shops and more.  Highly recommend a stay, or at the very least, a visit to this complex.  You could easily spend a day exploring the above shops and sites, as well as the adjacent gardens, including the two glass pavillions, and of course the evening light & sound shows!  Wow.

Good to say you've done it,ingridvjones,"We booked three nights here in one of the executive club rooms. This gave us access to the daily buffet, which was pretty good. The room was a very good size with lots of space to spread out. The bathroom was nice too with a separate soaker tub and double sinks. There was also a vanity area for getting ready outside the bathroom. Our view was of Gardens By The Bay which was lovely. We basically only chose this hotel for the pool. The pool was what you expect...crowded, but with a killer view. If I had to do all over again I'd stay one night, two max and not upgrade to the executive level. While it was a great room, I'm not sure it was worth it really. The hotel itself is not very exciting; the service is fine but not stellar. The bed was not comfortable at all.

Perfect!,mTan,"Kudos to Mac at the Sands lounge for addressing the long queue at check-in at 5pm on a Monday afternoon, and ushering us to the lounge for a private check-in. The whole experience was a huge plus for my partner who was not only a first-time visitor to Singapore, but was celebrating his birthday with a 1-night stay at MBS. Mac was incredibly courteous, observant and professional; the biggest blessing is that he upgraded our 1-night stay from a standard room to the Orchid Suite as well as a late check-out so we could enjoy the pool before catching our flight out. This really capped off our stay in Singapore on the best note possible and no doubt all the photos, videos and glowing review of your hotel and staff will be making its way back with us to Taiwan and Croatia.

Bucket list!!!,Diana L,"Initially, we encountered rude guests who did not want to give us privacy when getting our reward card. The hotel made up for the negative encounter by being very good to us while we stayed here. Older gentleman ambassador made sure I did not get lost looking for pharmacy. What wonderful services from lobby to concierge to swimming pool area. Place is clean and safe with lots of wonderful employees. ",5,October 2019,
Disappointed,TraceyBalboa,"Well you can't helped but be totally blown away by this epic looking hotel. Rooms are beautiful,good choice off restaurants and facilities with the added bonus of having loads of shops available on site. The downside for me was the rooftop bars,not as classy as I expected and it was quite disturbing to see so many people walking round in bathrobes at 10-11pm at night while I was in my finery 😐Call me old fashioned but didn't think that was right for the calibre of this amazing hotel",3,November 2019,
"Yes, but....",Di1970,"Fantastic views over the Gardens, an overall five star feeling in the hotel which oozes luxury, unique pool and rooftop.

Its actually hard to write the following because the room was, although not what we requested as I will point out shortly, simply beautiful, the view was great, bathroom was off the planet and the staff at the front of house did try their best, to a point. The let down though was the back of house attention to detail. as mentioned, this was a long planned trip and as such I gave advice that we would be stepping off a long haul flight early in the morning and requested an early check in with over a months notice, followed up twice by emails requesting confirmation of the same leading up to the check in date. Each time I received back  a vague response saying maybe it would be available.…",3,November 2019,
Amazing Views,JH99_10,"Stayed for just the one night  and was not disappointed. At check in, given an upgrade to overlook Garden Area and therefore enjoyed the Garden By the Bay Light Show from our Balcony. The Infinity Pool was such a treat and was everything I expected and more! Ate in Lavo Italian Restaurant to complete the evening. Left the following day, happy and contented.",5,November 2019,
Did Not Meet Expectations,Meaghan G,"To start with the good - the pool is incredible! I cannot say anything negative about the views and look of the pool area! It is impressive and there is nothing else to say about that. The view from our room was also impressive. We had a garden view room and it was stunning! The balcony was fabulous and I loved sitting out on our balcony and look at the lights in the gardens at night.  However, we stayed for 2 nights and had several issues I would not expect to have at a 5-star resort. First, there seems to be zero coordination for children. While I want children to have a good time as well, they should be confined into one of the three pool areas. People are taking expensive cameras and phones in for selfies in the pool and children are splashing around everywhere! It is…",3,November 2019,
Delightful Staff,pmdcs,"Have stayed here a few times before. A great place to finish after some epic journeys. This time returning after walking 800km ""el Camino Frances"" across Spain.

"This hotel sucks.  In a city of great hotels, you'd be foolish to stay here",johnwoodRTR,"In a city of the world's best hotels, the Marina Bay Sands has managed to take suck-i-ness to a whole new level.  The person running HR here should be fired as staff have no idea what they're doing.  Air con does not work -- in a city on the equator.  :(   Staff have no idea how to do simple things like bill your room for your meal.  Management first denies problems, then blames problems on the guest.  Finally, it's a ""cattle call"" of tour groups and feels more like a bus station than a nice hotel.",1,November 2019,

Selfie Sity,Jack G,"We had a great stay at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.  It was the jumping off point to a bigger trip to Thailand, and it was perfect for what we were looking for, i.e. a couple days to get used to the time difference in a relaxing atmosphere.  The hotel is a city unto itself.  The pool at the top is awesome with great views.  Odd they clean it everyday at 3:30 which is when it seemed to be the busiest.  The selfie taking in the pool was interesting to say the least.",5,October 2019,
Worth coming for the views and location but extremely busy not for relax,Claudia0971,"We chose this hotel as we were only spending a night coming back from Thailand and all in all are happy we did it, the location is great and the views you get form the rooms and of course both the pool desk and the observatory (which you have free access to being a guest) are worth the stay and the cost of the room, Also they very kindly still grant you access to the fitness centre once you check out so you can use the facilities and have a shower before flying home (generally night flights back to Europe) , the staff is impeccable and always very attentive and polite. It is of course the hotel it is so nothing much to fault, other than for this standard of hotel i found it a bit disappointing that little extra touches in the room were missing, for example an umbrella for…",4,November 2019,
30th Anniversary,Sky G,"I was always intrigued with pictures of Singapore, so we made it part of our 30th anniversary trip heading to the Maldives. You absolutely cannot visit Singapore and not stay at Marina Bay Sands, stay even one night if possible.  The infinity pool alone makes it an incredible experience.  We absolutely loved the pool.  We had drinks,  sat at the lounge chairs and enjoyed the gorgeous views.  We stayed in the pool for hours in the morning and at night.  Marina Bay Sands has restaurants, a jammin club, a mall connected to it and you have access to the Supergrove Trees/ Gardens of the Bay.   The service was excellent and they gave us a Happy Anniversary cake.   We loved it here and would come back to enjoy our stay at Singapore once again.

A great experience for our wedding anniversary,Thomas,"We spent our 1st wedding anniversary here and the staff were great. Counter check-in staff was exceptional and did their best to ensure that our stay was a great one! We booked a Premier City View King room and got the best view of the city and the daily night show, Spectra. The housekeeping team did a great job to ensure a clean room on arrival and assist us with our multiple requests. That night, we received, to our pleasant surprise, a nice chocolate cake and champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

Firstly I must say the whole experience was great..the infinity pool definitely being a highlight, and then drinks in C'est La Vie followed by dinner in Spargo (amazing..separate review to follow). However I have to say I was very disappointed with the hotel room..considering the very high price it was nothing out of the ordinary.Where the hotel could do better in this regard are firstly the toiletries..only 1 of a small body wash/shampoo/conditioner..certainly not enough for 2 people sharing. Cheap coffee sachets..only 1 of each for each guest and no…",3,November 2019,

Couldn't fault this wonderful hotel such a wonderful experience from checking in to checking out.  Thank you to Aram who checked us in to the hotel who made the the whole experience so much better.  Our room had a wonderful view was super clean and really impressive. Room service took about 40mins but the food was sensational and we were advised by the gentlemen who Brought us the food that they were super busy that night.  The infinity pool was a must do for anyone, the pool itself is worthy of the hefty price tag per night.  Thanks Marina Bay Sands, what a wonderful time. ",5,November 2019,

Spectacular if,Jcsvet,"It’s a spectacular hotel so long as you follow some rules: 1) don’t go cheap, all the rooms up until floor 22 have rubbish views on highway/busy Road (both sides of the building) 2) you need to be understanding with a staff that is overwhelmed (response time is delayed especially for in-room services) 3) choose a city view room (absolutely no doubt about it) 4) I would not recommend the breakfast: too crowded, service is overwhelmed, pricey compared to the restaurants in the adjacent mall   Pros: - magnificent views  - large and clean rooms - great soundproofing  - spectacular skypool  - good top floor restaurant   Cons: - busy lifts - busy reception desk  - lobby restaurants that makes you feel in a “Bazar” cf. Front people  Definitely a must go to.",5,November 2019,
Must stay to swim in the pool,49Travelmad,I stayed in a premium room on 21st floor. The room was the quietest room I have ever stayed in. The view from the infinity edge pool is fantastic. The pool is quite crowded but still a wonderful experience. The service is very good. The one caution is that the MBS is a tourist destination so not the peaceful hotel lobby experience.,5,October 2019,

The must do once in a lifetime Hotel in Singapore.,DebbySchipperSnelders1974,"With a hotel that has 2.500 rooms, it is hard to expect any personal service or staff to remember the guest names. And yes, MBS staff did prove me wrong! The friendliness on arrival: as the check in counters were very busy we could pass all and check in at the VIP desk. Well done, well seen by the staff.  Most guests coming to stay in MBS, come only for one night (Chinese and Koreans do) or come for the casino. Yes, we did see may selfie-shots in the pool at the top, but the casino guests seem to have their own departments to enjoy.  The room and the view are superb. The breakfast is a super wide range of choice of fresh fruits, bakery, warm and cold dishes, yummy the fresh salmon and banana cake. The restaurant is modern and fresh and staff very friendly and helpful.  The place…",5,October 2019,
Iconic hotel in Singapore,Ross Trevelyan,Stayed for 2 nights in this Iconic hotel. The facility is amazing and well organized. The only drawback is due to its size your tend to loose the personal touch. Breakfast you can choose one of 3 restaurants which are all busy but efficient which a fantastic choice for all visitors. One of the best hotels I have had the privilege of enjoying.,5,November 2019,
Great Pool,Tomh173,"I guess the draw card is the infinity pool, the atrium is pretty impressive too. But, frankly the rooms were bland functionality. I suggest you send your designers to Dubai for a week, they need an imagination implant. And the one thing that really annoyed me was there was no fridge. Basically if you moved anything in the minibar you were automatically charged for it. Really guy's that's very welcoming. Pretty sad. Won't be back.",2,October 2019,
Worth the splurge for a night,thelonglegsabroad,"I had a 18 hour layover in Singapore and decided to spend the money to spend it here. Of course, the pool is beautiful. It is very crowded and pretty much full of people trying to get that instagram shot. Get there early for a good lounge chair. The pull food is underwhelming, the drinks and delicious and of course it is all overpriced but thats the name of the game at high end resorts like this. The room was beautiful with a balcony overlooking Gardens by the Bay. I opted to watch the light show from my room my balcony and it was perfect.

Bad smell in the room,Iliayev,"Got a room with nice view but it was not so pleasent because of the smell. Smell of smoke, cigarettes. It was a non smoking floor, but still, the smell was there and that issue was not solved. The floor at the balcony was always wet and covered with water because of the plants watering system. I couldn’t seat at the balcony because of that. The iron didn’t functioned well.

I would totally suggest to stay in this hotel if you can there’s no better place to stay in Singapore than MBS.  Is it worthy staying at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore?   Regarding the room itself, we got an amazing suite upgrade for our honeymoon and were surprised by the size of the room. I felt as if I was staying at a top hotel in Las Vegas.

Called the restaurant at 11:30 PM, and hot food was in the room by 12 AM, with a smiling chaperone at the door. The food was yum, 5 stars for it. The room is the biggest that I had stayed so far in, the luxury was unparalleled.

Very Disappointing,Neil Quantick,"As a building - wow! Views from pool etc - amazing.  But, be aware that you are in a Goliath of a hotel and it feels like that.  Pound for pound against other Singapore hotels it is very expensive.  What shocked us was the poor finish in the room, and the really bad standard of cleaning.  Oh, and horribly uncomfortable beds!  We spoke to them about the beds and they sort of resolved it but it was all done terribly clumsily, and no sense of customer care and attention that you’d expect at their prices.  We felt very much like we were one of 2000 guests and if they could sort it they would and they couldn’t - hard luck.  At £600 a night it needed to be perfect, and it wasn’t close to.  Glad we stayed there as an experience, but would not go back.",2,November 2019,

A quick escape,Danielle A,"Was a sight to behold, quite surreal. It felt like you were some where special. Loved the rooms large comfortable clean and stylish. Great selection of restaurants and places to eat. Loved how you could access the Gardens by the Bay from the hotel. The infinity was stunning and quite special.

The Social Media hotel that’s better in pictures,PoodleRank,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands in a Deluxe King Sky room for two nights during the Grand Prix week.  I chose the MBS because it simply seemed to be the “it” place to stay in Singapore.  Overall, I felt that the Marina Bay Sands is a bit of a mixed experience, though worth staying one night just as a bucket list experience in Singapore.  The MBS is an enormous property attached to an enormous mall.  It consists of three buildings topped by the very famous pool.  The lobby is simply massive, with a towering light filled atrium.  It’s convenient in that it’s relatively self-contained … everything you might need is in the hotel or the mall.  It is also right next to the Gardens By the Sea and in the evening, you have the choice of two different light exhibit shows next to the…",4,September 2019,
Very Good,Finton R,"We stayed here for our honeymoon in September. As expected, fantastic views in Singapore coupled with good service and a myriad of class restaurants and bars.

Not as good as it ought to have been,Fiona2905,"This is a comfortable hotel but is so huge it isn't able to provide 5 star service.  Check in was very slow, room cleaning differed every day, sometimes we were left fresh toiletries, sometimes not.  We paid extra to upgrade to a higher floor room (floor 39) and the view over the bay was lovely but if you want something at the hotel you have to pay.  They are not in the business of doing you any favours. Even the bar by the pool has the best viewpoints roped off for people guaranteeing a minimum spend.  The pool was fantastic and the main reason we stayed there, but swimming in it is a nightmare because 99% of the people only go in it to take selfies.

Though pool is only accessible exclusively by hotel guests. Breakfast spread is great. Plenty of options. Check in took a bit of time but check out was express.

Absolutely worth it,charles926,"We stayed from Wednesday to Saturday morning in November, and found that it was not nearly as crowded or overwhelming as some reviews had warned. Although it is a massive hotel and entertainment complex, it is broken up into three tall towers so that each floor only has about a dozen rooms. Same with the pool: it is broken up into three sections, with several levels of sunny and shaded lounge chairs and cabanas. It was well-used but never overcrowded, and we never had trouble finding the perfect place to relax.    We were impressed that this massive hotel was able to feel so intimate and relaxing.

Try It Once,Nick,"MBS is of course one of the icons of Singapore. Everyone should do it once, just to experience the pool. That being said, its very expensive, in my opinion for what you get. almost S$500 a night. Check in took a while, but we were given temporary access to the pool while we waited for the room, which was nice since we just stayed one night. We got an upgrade to an upper room facing the gardens with a small balcony, which was nice to watch the gardens show without having to leave. The hotel itself and the mall feel a bit ""vegas"" like and doesn't feel like authentic Singapore to me, but to each their own.",3,October 2019,

If you are expecting personal luxury then this hotel isn’t for you, considering it has 2500 rooms they do a brilliant job of managing that.   It’s a bucket list hotel and does not disappoint.

So we booked one night at the MBS during our stay in Singapore.   We arrived close to 3pm and the lobby was crazy busy. The SIngapore Grand Prix was the night before so the hotel was packed. The line moved quickly. We were checked in and I told the front desk that it was our first trip to Singapore and if they could check for any complimentary upgrades for me. We really wanted to be able to see the Supertrees at night. The front desk was able to accommodate us and I was all the more thrilled for it.

That rooftop infinity pool is amazing,Ashley O.,"We stayed for one night as we passed through Singapore. As far as what you pay for the place is nice. You have your own balcony and the room is nice. I think that Singapore is just expensive in general. If you can stay for a night do it just for the views but overall I'm not sure it's worth the price. It is a one stop shop, you have restaurants, a casino, and shops but the hotel was an architectural beauty but there are other nice hotels in the area. The big pull is the amazing rooftop infinity pool. I think it's worth it just to experience that.",4,May 2019,
Iconic hotel,micheics,"Had a fabulous stay here. 6 nights in a club room on 47th Floor, fantastic view to the gardens on the bay.

Hotel itself is clean and impressive in size and shape. Rooms are huge but a little bit dissappointing more on the 4* side than in the luxurious 5*. Decor is standard and distribution of the bathroom is odd but all Works well and is mainteined properly.Internet Works well. The swimming pool is huge although can feel crowded specially on the kids side. It's a good idea to keep an adult only space. The gardens by the pool are very nice and well kept. Personnel are always kind. Open spaces are very nice and all surroundings are superb: Shops, casino and gardens by the bay. A good experience overall.",4,October 2019,
Amazing experience!,YourAveragePerson88,"My husband and I stayed here for one night just for the experience. Prior to arriving I read some of the recent ‘average/poor’ reviews and was worried we had wasted our money.... but we definitely didn’t! We loved our stay! Check out is pretty manic but little did we know you could actually check in at tower 3 too. We got upgraded which was great. Pool is a must!

We enjoyed our unlimited access to sky park and infinity pool. Their pool is really big with a nice view of the entire city. We love everything about this hotel and looking forward to stay here again.,4,November 2018,
Bucket List Destination,GayWhistler,Really enjoyed our stay at the Marina Bay Sands. I stayed in a Garden View Room (2122) in Tower 3 - loved the room. It has a large balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay were you could watch the night light show of the giant trees dance. Spectacular sunrise. Having access to the Infinity Pool was amazing - Instagrammer's dream.... the pool water was on the cool side but still comfortable enough. Really enjoyed the hot tubs that overlooked the Gardens.   The Front Desk and Conceirge were both just okay. For a premium property one's expectation for exceptional service is expected - however they fell short here.  Spending a night or two is worth it if you want to experience the Infinity Pool - but spending more than that I think there are other better value properties to…,3,October 2019,
"Great venue, dreadful management",Mat,"Look, the venue is great, the rooms are great. All that stops me from giving 10/10 is the worst hotel management I’ve seen in my business life.   (1) The receptionists don’t understand English. I ask for a place to work and they point me to a smoking corner. Only one, Maria, saved the day. I don’t expect the cleaning lady to speak English fluently, but for pete’s sake, hire some educated receptionists. In Europe if you must. For $400 a night one would expect that.  (2) We arrived at 13:00 and they could not assign us to a hotel room (not give us access, but even tell which one!) and told us to wait until 15:00. “We will mail you when it’s ready”. Of course they did not. They they tried to tell us a ridiculous story that there is no twin room with a good view, only king bed. (Is…",2,October 2019,
Great hotel,maidenheadmiss,"We stayed for 3 nights Oct 2019, deluxe room on the 34th floor 3492, end of the corridor, tower 1.  I thoroughly recommend this room as both room and bathroom were huge.   Because of its situation the bedroom overlooked the city and the bathroom the Gardens on the Bay, both views are spectacular.  Our guest service agent Xing Fu, went out of his way to make our stay as comfortable as possible, nothing was too much trouble for him, he’s a real credit to the hotel.  The hotel is in easy reach of all transport, the city, the gardens and really is the centre of Singapore.  The only down side, which is not much, is that the pool is always crowded as everyone, including me, wants to take a picture in the infinity pool against the city backdrop but I would stay in this hotel again in a…",5,October 2019,
Amazing!!!,Ponika,Nothing to say but WOW! Singapore is the city of awesomeness. I was there in the evening and stay there until night to enjoy the night view which was spectacular. It is a must-visit place when you visit Singapore.,5,February 2019,
Exciting things about this place,gooseSolihull,Lovely location a must do.Roof top pool is stunning. Rooms are good. Reception staff and on floor and household are attentive.Enjoyed our stay.Clean rooms at front are noisy from traffic casino etc Level 5-9.Very busying the lowest levels shopping reception areas. Parks. And night show outside well seeing is believing,5,October 2019,
Extremely disappointing...,Sharon,"Had been emailing Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for months and months. Confirmed pricing, room requests etc. I thought everything would work out perfect. Upon check in everything was on track, or so I thought?   We were moved from Tower 3 (as per email confirmation booking) to Tower 1. Paid $940.00 AUD for 1 night + late check out (due to late flight back to Australia. Received an upgraded room, which everyone gets at MBS.   Fridge was locked in our room and we were required to pay a $10 SG deposit to have it unlocked...Not wanting to use the mini bar, but keeping milk cold would have been ideal.  Our room was on Level 17, and SMELL !!! Something was happening on this floor? They had dehumidifiers going and the stench was sickening. We would get out of the elevator at other levels and…",2,October 2019,
Fantastic Club 55 Stay,8463tommo,"I had read some negative reviews about the MBS and the value of paying extra for Club 55 access. Well my experience was nothing other than excellent. The breakfast choice was amazing. Afternoon tea was less so but still superb. The evening 5-7pm session was a combination of endless good food and bottomless glasses of your choice(s) of alcoholic, or non-alcoholic, refreshment. Above all, the staff at Club 55 were fantastic, particularly Marjohn and Jhuly, who couldn’t do enough to make sure we had everything we wanted - and more !! Also, Kate on the Club 55 reception was always cheery and welcoming. The hotel is like a film set and doesn’t disappoint in any respect. Our 47th floor Club Garden View room was huge with wonderful en-suite facilities and a shower fit for royalty. In…",5,October 2019,
First class Hotel,Saadiah A,We checked in to 30th floor Premier King Garden View. Its spacious and overlooking the Garden by the bay. Mesmerizing view of the harbour . The hotel was fully booked on 26/11 Eve of Deepavali so there’s quite a crowd and long queues during checking in . Breakfast are split into 3 locations and we went to the 57th Flr restaurant Spago. Good spread of buffet with nice ambience. Good service by staffs . Great stay ...,5,October 2019,
Nothing Extravagant,dng_wanders,"Clean, comfy rooms just like any other 5-star hotels. But maybe I expected too much based from reviews and some articles I read. I thought I'd be in awe. But the grandeur I was looking for was not there. The lobby is just huge (and crowdy during my visit) but its not appealing. It should be the first to make an impression. Other 5-star hotels have scents all over their properties, this has none. The elevator does not even have a pipe in music. Lead-in rooms in other 5-star hotels would have pillow menus and upscale coffee makers, this has the basic ones. Interiors are just okay. They could have done better on the design of the lobby, they could have placed grand chandeliers. The pool, just okay.   One thing I liked though is the service.  They have friendly and attentive people…",4,October 2019,
Do it for an experience,Tony R,"From the moment you enter the front doors you senses are rocketed to new ideas of luxury. Marina Bay Sands Hotel is an over the top experience you have to try once. We stayed 2 nights on the 24th floor with a city view room. When you enter your room the curtains automatically open and transform the room from darkness to bright light exposing a majestic panorama of downtown Singapore City and Marina Bay. The rooms are very nice with a lounge and a study/writing table, a large bathroom and a reasonable wardrobe. You make your way up to the 57th floor and you lay eyes on the masses of young people with iphone in hand up against the edge of the infinity pool. Relaxation for them is not what they have come here for but that one in a million shot of them with the Singapore skyline…",5,October 2019,
Average but one to tick off the list,Ruth L,"Marina Bay Sands was on our list of “must do” hotels, so when my husband was staying here for business, I jumped at the chance of joining him. Very glad I did it, but was it worth it? No .....  If you love Vegas hotels, then this is the place for you. It’s big, it’s horrendously busy, noisy, over-priced and totally money orientated. It’s also looking very tired in places - definitely needs some money spent on it. In no way is this a five star hotel. The rooms are “average”, the bed was rock solid and very uncomfortable, and there is no turn down service in the evenings. The lifts will drive you up the wall (if they are working) - it took us 2 lifts to get to the pool, or 3 to get to the gym (and they are so slow). Breakfast you just feel like you’re “processed” (at a price).…",3,October 2019,
Early Pool Access & Free Observation Deck Access,Anne,"Highlights: Infinity pool with amazing views, plenty of food and shopping without walking in the hot humid air, balcony views of Gardens by the Bay or City Lights & Merlion, complimentary bottles of water always replenished, deep soaking/leg shaving tub, access to the Observation Deck.  Meh: Everything inside the hotel and restaurants is about twice the price it would be outside the hotel, and it didn't always feel ""worth it"" (unless it’s already included.)  The hotel is like it's own island within an island, so going outside for non-Resort restaurants or shopping is either a 20min walk minimum or a taxi/grab ride away.  It's also missing some finer touches and considerations that you'll get in other five star hotels- in some ways it felt like a 4 star resort hotel with just one…",4,October 2019,
2 nights stopover,darren s,"On arrival got an upgrade deal to a club room. This included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks (alcohol) / snacks. This was well worth the money, especially if you like a drink as alcohol prices can be expensive. I won’t go on too much as I imagine most things have been said. Great room, amazing city view, and to top it off the infinity pool. ",5,October 2019,
Great Experience!,deamarielocsin,"The hotel is impressively big with exceptional services and facilities. The views are breathtaking especially at night. The rooms are so big, comfortable bed, great city view, and seemed to have everything you need. The pool was a bit crowded but it was still great. We dined at Spago. Great experience!",5,August 2019,
Great stay at this Singapore icon,GaryandLesleyTravel,"No surprises here, this is a top end hotel and it delivers as such. The large team ensures this hotel functions smoothly. They are friendly and highly responsive. Requests made are acted on quickly and with pleasure. On site restaurants were great as was the infinity pool. A tip in regards to this is that the adults only end of the pool is above tower 3. The room was perfect as was the balcony and garden view. It’s not cheap but it delivers against expectation.",5,October 2019,
"Noisy, like Vegas on steroids!",Jo A,"We only lasted 5 minutes in the bar on top of the hotel and that cost us £22!!  Terrible give it a miss. The Bar was crowded, tatty and hot as it had no air conditioning. The swimming pool very crowded. The view is spectacular but much nicer to go on the Singapore Flyer and get a view that way.",1,October 2019,
Outstanding 5 star hospitality,David Lee,Booked a trip to the famous MBS hotel for our two year anniversary and everything about the hotel and especially the service was amazing.  Nicole yu bin Lee and her colleague Jesse were very helpful in making our stay perfect.  They made sure our stay was perfect by upgrading our rooms and also allowing us to dine at a MBS restaurant complimentary of them!  We had a few small hiccups along the way but their immediate attention and ability to accommodate our needs was impeccable.  I hope everyone gets to experience the service I had from Nicole!,5,October 2019,
Best View and Service,Lux_Bru,"The services given were top notch and they quickly solved our problems when we wanted to check out.My husband and I love the smell outside of our room. Housekeeping was very attentive. Evertime we arrived from visiting places, the room was already cleaned. Would stay there next time with garden by the bay view. ",5,December 2018,
"Amazing views, gorgeous room",13Jonesy,"The rooftop infinity pool is as amazing as it looks although it does get very busy late afternoon. Fantastic views of the city from one side of the hotel and the beautiful Gardens by the Bay from the other. Breakfast choices were huge and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly. I was initially a bit worried that this hotel might be too big and impersonal, like the Fontainebleau in Miami, which I wasn’t a huge fan of, but no worries here, they have got the balance just right. Loved the Italian restaurant and outdoor bar for cocktails in the evening. Hubbie said the gym is the best place ever for a workout and very well equipped",5,October 2019,
one of the Top World Hotels,Gabriele S,"Even when you have no money for a full week to stay at Marina Bay Sands, you could catch a great view across the Marina Bay for low money. You could either book one night to have the full experience of the greatest infinity pool in the world or visit one of the roof top bars and admire the amazing view across the bay while drinking a cup of coffee or a cocktail. During the normal off peak times it is no problem during the week to get a place on the terrace, or you book a table for the weekend for diner to see also the great light show of the Supertrees. The Marina Bay Sands is THE statement of MODERN ARCHITECTURE - don't miss it!  The lobby alone is breathtaking!!",5,October 2019,
Excellent,Ankush Sharma,"One of the best places to stay, this is like another island consists of everything. All the facilities are available and one of the best hotels in the Town. Banquet and conventional services are very good. The Best part is the infinity pool.  ",5,October 2019,
Truly a unique experience,H5ofus,"We arrived at the hotel having lost part of our luggage in transit via Air China. The staff at the hotel were so welcoming and lovely. We were thankfully in such a great location that we could buy things we did not have in the shopping centre attached to the hotel the next day. Views, accommodation and basically everything was perfect at the hotel. We would recommend it as it’s such a great experience especially the swimming pool in top of the hotel. Thank you Marina Bay Sands Hotel for a wonderful experience.",5,July 2019,
An unbelievable stay!,Simran S,"We stayed at MBS for a night during our Singapore trip and checked in with a lady called Hill. We had mentioned that our holiday was due to celebrating my sister's 21st and 10 minutes or so later as Hill handed us our keys, she was smiling but we had no idea why. She'd upgraded us to a Straits Suite which I believe is the largest and most expensive suite in the hotel (little over 6000 SGD.) We were amazed! The suite is huge with around 15 rooms and stunning 51st floor views of both sides of the hotel. Special thank you to Hill as she truly made our whole trip as we weren't expecting that at all!  Aside from this amazing upgrade, the hotel is brilliant itself. The casino and attached shopping centre make it easy to spend time here without needing to travel out of the hotel.

Better than your expectations!,Tiago L,"Stayed here for one night and what great experience it was.  The staff is really kind and always willing to help you, I would like to give a special thanks to Mr. Mansor who welcomed us warmly. The rooms are huge and well equipped, the bathroom has all the amenities you may need, there is a shower and a bathtub (at the least in the room we stayed in). The bed was really comfortable and the mattress was firm which was great for me! For sure the best night sleep I had during our the trip to Bali/Singapore. The hotel is busy but you cannot hear any noise in the room.  Even though the hotel is enormous the cleansing of the rooms and all the public areas was always spotless.

Our guest service agent that was assigned to our room made sure our room was always clean and our stay comfortable. The infinity pool can be busy but amazing and the views at night is breathtaking.

"Vegas in Singapore, which can be the best or the worst depending on who you ask",Lindsay Nelson,"Marina Bay Sands by all objective measure is a good hotel, but you have to want what it offers:  1.	That famous infinity pool.  2.	Sprawling footprint that means getting your steps in, whether you like it or not.    3.	Multiple restaurants fronted by once celebrity chefs, like Spago by Wolfgang Puck. A variety of sophisticated dining options means you don’t have to venture far to find something to indulge in, from sushi to Italian to high end Chinese.  4.	Stunning views for days and days and days from your room, the gym, the pool.  5.	Luxury shopping without having to leave aircon. 6.	Nightclubs like Lavo and Marquee. 7.	Tours, groups and long check-in lines.  8.	Rooftop gym with mesmerizing 360 views almost compelling enough to help you forget you’re exercising on vacation. …",4,October 2019,

Not what we expected,ella T,"The hotel is beautifully designed and decorated, but, for my liking, it’s really too big and crowded. When we checked in, no one explained us anything from where we can go and what we can see  The staff is friendly and helpful, the room is ordinary as any other 5 stars hotel. As we booked two rooms, one of the rooms was garden view and the other was city view which was definitely more beautiful. As the hotel guests we visited the sky view and the infinity pool which is really amazing and beautiful  The beds are very good and comfy. There is a lot of restaurants, bars, shops and even a Casino.

Excellent Stay,Michelle H,"We came with another couple for our wedding anniversaries and we had the best time. We had Grand Club City View Rooms with outstanding views towards the city. Day or night the views were unbeatable. As we had club 55 services we ate breakfast and dinner and sometimes afternoon tea here depending on how our day was looking. Well worth paying extra for club access as there was plenty of good and different food options available. We never went thirsty or hungry. They are very generous with their champagne pouring! Views are amazing from wherever you sit. TOP TIP: arrive at 4.40pm just before the 5pm service to avoid waiting for a table.

ONCE IN A LIFETIME! Although...,Darren,This is possibly one of the best hotels I’ve been to. Although the only downfall they have in my opinion is if you have a later flight they don’t really accommodate you! As a frequent traveler most hotels accommodate you/let you use facilities. I can understand why they don’t due to the popularity of the hotel. But they should maybe have a waiting lounge or something along they lines. A Luxurious service shouldn’t stop at the door.  Other than that 1000000% and would highly recommend,5,October 2019,
More style than substance,Helen O,"Tourist hotspot Great location with the Marina, Bay gardens, metro and shopping centre on its doorstep but there are so many nice hotels in Singapore that this one just doesn’t deliver.  WiFi - kept dropping off, kept having to go back into settings and reconnect. Most frustrating and I was only trying to use on my phone.  Pool -  very busy pool with no shade, no umbrellas and it was 33C. I want the option of moving into shade when I eat or when I get too hot sunbathing. The pool is a great spot for selfies, I’ve never seen so many phones in a Swimming pool! Give up any hope of actually swimming though.  Room - good. Comfy bed and bedding.

We had lovely staff meet us at the airport and show us to the car where we were transported in style to the Hotel complex. The staff took us to the suite to complete check in within the comfort of our room.  We were never bothered by housekeeping, the rooms always serviced whilst we were out.  The hotel has easy access to Gardens by the Bay and the shopping mall which is great for window shopping not so much for the credit card.  The only reason this is not a 5 star review is the exclusion of our 9yr old daughter in some of the restaurants.

YOU PAY FOR THE VIEW AND IT'S WORTH IT!,Funlovinfella,"We had one night here in a Grand Club Room that faced the city and the views were amazing!  The room was huge and suitably over the top as is everything in this hotel. It's huge, the foyer I'd like an airport transit terminal.   The room itself was luxurious, huge bed, revolving TV, dining table, sofa, easy chairs and that stunning view!  The bathroom was mahoosive and was stocked with every bell and whistle!  The club lounge was akin to an airport lounge that had more than it's fair share of 'finger clicking' guests.

Simply Outstanding,Braveheart14,We recently stayed at Marina Bay Sands as a 25th wedding anniversary celebration with another couple also celebrating a wedding anniversary milestone. We were all extremely excited about our visit to Singapore and visit to MBS. Because of our wedding anniversary we decided to stay in a Grand Club Room. From the moment we arrived we were blown away with not only the immense size of the hotel but the exceptional service we received. Check in was a breeze. Although we arrived on an early morning flight we were given facilities to change and freshen up so we could enjoy the day while waiting for our room to be ready.

Overpriced gimmick but good views and location,UpSide123,"Marina Bay sands is in a great location, there is a metro stop right under the building and you can access the walkway to the Sky Gardens and Park from the ground floor. The rooftop pool and bar are worth going just for the picture... which is what the 600 other people crammed in obviously thought too. The whole experience was a bit more like a theme park/vegas hotel than the luxury destination it markets its self as and got quite tiresome over the 4 nights we stayed there. Upon arrival no one greets you and you have to wander across the foyer dodging the hundreds of tourist to join the long queue for check in.

Marina Bay Sands Hotel,Hilary,"I was most excited to come here and saved up a lot of money to be able to afford to stay here for one night at the end of my travelling journey.   I paid £400+ pounds for one night and had very high expectations for this hotel.  Overall I was disappointed with my stay, I had such high expectations for this hotel and was really looking forward to spending the money I had saved up especially to come and stay here.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I know plenty of people who have been and have said they had the best stay.  Here is why I think this;   When I arrived I was told my room had been upgraded, which was great and I appreciated this.

Good but expensive and with a few issues.,Wolfage,"When you arrive at Marina Bay Sands the mode of transport is everything.  If you arrive in a taxi it seems that you are left to bring in your own luggage. If you arrive in a car, porters appear to take your luggage and give you a receipt. Most hotels would not discriminate in this way.  Checking in was efficient if someone spots your baggage receipt and you’re lucky enough to be escorted to the VIP checkin (although those bringing in their own luggage have to join the long queue for the normal checkin). Checkout can be as simple as dropping your key into one of the quick checkout slots.  The room was very good.

Nice and expensive,Jackie B,When we checked in we saw a lot of tourists. But thats what we expected cause Singapore is a stopover destination. Everything is big and modern and very clean but when we came in our room we were a little bit disappointed cause it just looks like a normal hotelroom... the service was friendly and of course the infinity pool great (buuuut very expensive when you want to drink something there). The shopping offer is amazing. Finally i would say it is worth to stay one or two nights there but not longer.,4,October 2019,

They called and wrote to make sure we liked everything. Just thought they were so wonderful in everyday.

Just do it!,SueBM,"We splurged and spent three nights at MBS and absolutely loved it.  Firstly, it is in a great spot - close to Gardens by the Bay, on top of an MTR station, close to the CBD and within walking distance of many other sites. Secondly - the buzz. It is an enormous hotel, with an enormous amount of people, shops, restaurants and with that comes a sense of excitement. Thirdly, of course - pool. We were concerned that it would be too crowded and yes, there are a lot of people, but you can find a relatively quiet place to lie away from the masses.  I do have to disclose one thing - somehow our room was upgraded (this has never happened to us before, but my son had a corneal ulcer and was wearing an eyepatch when we checked in....) so our standard room became a suite. Thank you Marina…",5,July 2019,
Awesome building - incredibly busy,RoobyBeagle,"Luxury short break for work & pleasure. This is an incredible place but 2,500 rooms means it’s really really busy and really really expensive for what you get. We were up at 6 to be able to use the pool or it’s jam packed. We booked a suite so we could use the club facilities - queued for evening canapés +++. Don’t get me wrong, it’s stunning, iconic and very modern but if quieter & more intimate is your gig, hi somewhere else. Oh, and by the way, the gym and it’s facilities are a joke.

On the day we arrived we where upgraded to a Garden View room free of charge on the 14th floor which had the most amazing views of Gardens by the Bay, the room was beautiful and very luxurios our bags where delivered to our room 15 minutes later, which was very helpful, great CS at this point! then to my surprise there was a knock at my door 10 mins later and we where delivered a cake for our 10th wedding anniversary, which was a nice touch.  Now the reason I booked this hotel..... The amazing roof top pool, OMG the views are amazing, and an experience my family and I will never forget.We went up to the pool area at around 4pm, it was busy, but not too crowded as it started to rain a little and…",5,October 2019,
SameA unique experience,Petropouloum,"From all points of view this huge hotel will stay in my memory. The entrance and the restaurants further down, the nice shops and the lady musicians who played Asian music near the entrance are an attraction. As I arrived in the room, the curtains opened automatically and the astonishing view of marina bay appeared. The room was very nice and clean, well equipped with amenities. Up on the boat-shaped roof, there are restaurants, night clubs, bars and a huge swimming pool and the view all around  is magnificent. The breakfast up there was one of the best I have ever tasted: extremely good, full of variety and offered the best bacon I have ever eaten: crispy and full of flavor! Later, the same restaurant offers fantastic food and drinks. When swimming in the pool, one gets a…",5,November 2018,

Great Place to Stay,Lillo747,"I spent the Formula One weekend at the Marina Bay Sands and I had a really great experience. The restaurants, shops, casino and train station made it really easily accessible to all of Singapore. The facility coped very well with the large amount of visitors. Would highly recommend and stay again.",5,September 2019,
Impressive but without soul or real character,Martin C,"Interesting hotel, I booked here because I’d seen loads of TV programs about the building and the pool at the top and I booked via an International Concierge service who I’ve worked with for years for this hotel and the 2019 F1 that was my main reason for visiting.  Eight months before the event at time of booking I was told that the hotel was full and the only rooms available were garden view, I got my booking service to query this and they were told again that that was the case … no way could I have a city view.  We arrived and the door service and reception service worked like clockwork and I’m soon at the reception desk where to my surprise they offer me an upgrade to a city view for a fee …. I query this as I thought the place was packed but no a city view is suddenly…",4,September 2019,
One of a kind architecture and vista,Anthony A,"I took a night tour which included a ride up the elevator to the 56th floor.  The vista included views of the bay, cargo ships, opera houses, and city buildings.  A must in Singapore if you can only do 1 thing.",5,September 2019,
Amazing experience,GGG,"We were so lucky we booked this hotel as our daughter fell sick and we couldnt go out and explore anything but gladly this hotel had everything in it. My children loved spending time in the infinity pool, we enjoyed shoppe at marina bay , the local laksa in the food court and my elder girl loved the digital interactive floor. All in all it was worth spending money on this hotel. Would recommend all the people specially travelling with children.",5,September 2019,
Surreal experience..for different reasons,MP18,"I spent 1 night at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and I need to admit that I had never seen something similar before in my life. The architecture and the concept of this hotel is just breathtaking but I am not gonna focus on this aspect, rather I will list what I found amazing and ... what I did not like... yes something that I did not quite like happened during the checkin. Let me explain this. I was staying in a different hotel in Singapore and the day before the checkin at the Marina Bay Sands I phone them up to make a request for an early check in. I was not given a clear answer on that but they just said that this kind of request is subject to availability. Fair enough. The day after I headed to the hotel and during the checkin I was offered an early checkin option with an…",4,October 2019,
Trip to Singapore,Liz S,"stayed at this Hotel for two nights, loved the pool and pool service.

Two wounderful days and nights,Anderssen,I got to stay in the 70 years gift. Our stay was Club 56. We got 2 great days and nights. Taking a morning bath overlooking Singapore is an unforgettable experience. There will definitely be a few days at the hotel next time we go to the East. Am already looking forward to it.,5,November 2018,
Best hotel in Singapore,Gurnam,This hotel is pricey but definitely is the best hotel in Singapore. We went during the 2019 F1 racing hence they upgraded us for free to a water view room where we could see the race through our bedroom window. Great location very central. Very helpful and friendly staff. The mini bar is expensive!!,5,September 2019,
Disappointed,Vishal,"Having stayed here before I know what level of service to expect. So I decided to book a room for my honeymoon as well as my birthday and coming to Singapore for the F1.   What can I say, the experience of MBS was very disappointing.  I made it clear I’m here for a special occasion, I email before hand as well noticed the check in staff.   I was given a complement chocolate. Which was 5 small bits, now I was looking for a handout but small things like recommendations on where to go or suggestion as it’s your honeymoon why not go to one of our restaurants where we will book you a table would have been nice.   I think the bit which showed me how inconsistent the service is, was when I was leaving my room and my neighbour had a cake delivered to them saying as it was your birthday…",2,September 2019,
Amazing,LucBern-Switzerland,"The lobby is very crowdy and impersonal. We had the room at 26th floor and the view was wonderful The room with balcony is well equiped and was very nice. The swimming pool in the top is great although there were a lot of people. Very nice view from the roof top Terrasse. Big choise of very good restaurants and bars. All over very, very expensive stay.

What you see is what you get,Tamara T,"We stayed here for one night, which is pretty much all you need.  Yes, the building is amazing, the views from the top are astonishing and the infinity pool is an incredible experience.  However - it is extremely busy and crowded, very over-priced and in some respects starting to show its age.  Some aspects of the decor could really use some attention, particularly in common hotel areas like lifts and hallways which clearly see a lot of traffic.  Notwithstanding this, the staff are very friendly and helpful and it is exceptionally well-located with enough in and around the complex to keep the most jaded traveller amused for at least 24 hours.",4,October 2019,
Beautiful Singapore,Wasai,Amazing experienced offering incredible views of the Marina Bay area from 56th floor and better to come 30-40 minutes before sunset and stay until it get dark to see the beauty of Singapore at night.❤,5,July 2019,
Fantastic View from the top,Kyle K,"Location is in a great area. The view from the observation deck 54 floors up is beyond any expectations you might have. Go late in the day and watch the sunset, you won't be  disappointed. Seeing the gardens light up is also a plus. Rooms and hotel in general is good and very busy. Easy to get transportation around the city.",4,September 2019,
Amazing pool and view rooms were OK,Iyari123,"The hotel is huge, amazing view from the pool, we stayed there and had a great time. Have to mention that the rooms are very big yet in terms of decor they are average. Not something too modern. We had a city view, really beautiful. I would recommend taking the hotel for at least 1 night if you are in Singapore, no need to do more. Don’t forget to check out the big mall of marina sands, just beautiful!",4,October 2019,
It's cool... I guess,Marshall Ryan,"I booked this as a romantic gesture and because of that, maybe I had heightened expectations. However, being from the Bay, staying here was like flying to Singapore to stay in Vegas. The pool, phenomenal. Everything else... sub par and over priced. Book a night, but one will be sufficient. IMHO",3,October 2019,
Exceeding luxury standards,Daniel T,"By far one of the most luxurious hotels you'll find world wide. Had a chance to be here during my Singapore visit. Accommodation is super luxurious, Restaurant experience one of the finest. In the hotel lobby itself you have many activities to do. And of course the Infinity Pool gives you an unprecedented view of Singapore.",5,November 2018,
Just Wow!,Franz S,That is just an amazing experience to have in Singapore.architecture of the very next Generation all over the place. We went to the rooftop bar and took some overpriced Drinks. But anyways stunning view there,5,October 2019,
Good hotel with average service,Mark S,"Second stay at MBS. Service wise is still the same - average. Took the room facing the Gardens by the Bay which comes with a very short depth balcony. FYI, rooms facing the city are without balcony and more expensive. Also, try to check-in early and request for a high floor as the views would be better.   All room guests have access to the rooftop pool. Best time to go to the pool is in the evening as you'll get the sunset skyline and the view of the city at night. My profile photo was taken at the rooftop pool during our first stay.   Also, don't try replacing any drinks in the fridge with your own as the fridge is automated and will detect that a can/bottle was remove hence a ""consumption"" notice sent to the hotel and you will be charged even though you did not consume the…",4,October 2019,
The voucher offer is a hoax,Robert_Christophor,"The hotel was supposed to be one of the highlights of our stay. The swimming pool certainly is. The room was really spaceous and had a great view. But the promotion we got when booking the  room really is a disappointment, and i would rather call it a hoax. With the booking we were told that we could get a voucher up to 150 dollar to spend in shops and restaurants. Once in the hotel we tried to get it, but we were diverted to the casino, where we understood that we first have to earn the 150 by spending money in the shops...",4,October 2019,
Great views and architecture but awful service,SAshimi B,"I stayed with my husband for our anniversary for a few nights.  Quick summary: gorgeous architecture, amazing views AMAZING VIEWS!!!, excellent amenities, clean and spacious room, poor customer experience, grumpy staff, hotel service was less important than security and room design was not practical.  ********Arrival experience****** Pros: - Amazing architecture, what a grandeur building, so beautifully designed! Very impressive on both exterior and interior. - Smells wonderful - They provided us welcome drinks Cons: - When we first arrived we noticed not everyone was offered the vallet suitcase prior to checkin - First impression was I felt interrogated; While standing in line to check in we were asked by one staff what we were doing in line and he also asked us 5 mins later to…",3,October 2019,
Worth the splurge,PBot,"I stayed here for one night for the same reason as many people - the pool! Booking the ‘cheapest rate’ I had a room on the 10th floor so resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn’t have as great a view as those higher up in the tower. How wrong I was - my room looked over Gardens by the Bay and I thoroughly recommend booking a Gardens view if you can.   The pool, as hoped, was spectacular. I first went there at 5pm after checking in and there were quite a few there, but I got a sun lounger no problem and enjoyed time in the pool with plenty of photo opportunities! The busiest time was around 8/9pm when people arrive back from sightseeing. To maximise use of the pool I got up early at 7am and headed up to the pool (checkout is at 11). Again, a few others had the same idea but it…",4,October 2019,
Excellent,TashCushla,"This hotel is such an icon and is worth a stay for the pool and it’s location. The pool is only accessible to guests and had stunning views. The hotel links to the shoppes at marina bay which was really handy to access food and shopping. Taxis come and go from both tower 1 and tower 3 so easy access when leaving hotel. Gardens by the Bay is a short walk. Please be mindful that the hotel is huge and so check in and check out gets very busy and long waits are expected. The room was very spacious and comfortable, and well serviced every day. The only negative I would say is there is limited seating in the lobby which is inconvenient if you have to wait for your room to be ready, in which case I would advise to walk over to the shoppes for something to do ",5,October 2019,
Expensive bragging rights but one for the bucket list,Rob East,I booked a room on our way to Vietnam for my partners birthday present. Total opulence and snobbery at its best. The service is amazing as is the food. We were upgraded to a family suite and a complimentary birthday cake was delivered when I advised the special birthday occasion. The rooftop pool is excellent but it does get a bit crowded. Make sure you're well cashed up because everything is very expensive. However the inner greenie in me could not help but feel a pang of guilt when looking out from the rooftop with all the pollution and smog that by partaking and supporting I was adding to the pollution problem. Greta would be staring daggers at us too surely.,5,October 2019,
Luxury at it's best..,Zoya B,The rooms were very luxurious as expected. Check in process was swift and seamless. I was celebrating my birthday so the team at MBS got me an early check in and a complimentary cake as well. Fantastic view of the city if you take the city view rooms and the infinity pool was just amazing. Highly recommended.,5,September 2019,
Xmas stay,David Warner,"Stunning hotel. Lucky enough to have a suite overlooking the bay and the gardens. Loved Club 55 and also the infinity pool. Singapore was a blast, tried everything from the cricket club to the zoo. Loved the underground, so easy to use.",1,December 2018,
Amazing!!!!!,crew2008,"The hotel is superb and the views are breath taking.  Rooms are large, super clean, spacious fantastic views and beautifully decorated. Massive bed, so much space and all the extra touches you’d expect from a high-end hotel. The view was simply stunning. There was a little gift of some chocolates for us in the room too.  There’s a great selection of shops and restaurants in this vast hotel.  All staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The pool on the 57th floor becomes an avenue to reach other towers. the views are incredible and the cocktails very tasty (and not even that expensive compared to other hotel alcohol prices).  There is also an observation deck which public can access for a fee but open to hotel guests. Access to pool is monitored and you must use your room key.…",5,September 2019,
Nice stopover and unique experience,Dario D,"On the way from Europe to Bali we stopped in Singapore and had a fantastic experience at the Marina Bay Sand. We booked online two rooms as we were 2 adults and three kids. The price was fair considering the level of the hotel. We arrived around 11am and already gave us access to one of the two connected rooms. The view from the room was astonishing, with curtains opening on the skyline. The pool experience was unique, the view amazing and we all loved the facility and the service. Also the last morning when we were leaving, they allowed us to stay at the pool area after the checkout, waiting for our transfer to the airport. Top hotel, top service, top view. Price on the high end in line with it.",5,September 2019,
"Solid experience at Marina Bay Sands: room, dining, and pool",FlyingJocelyn,"My husband and I recently booked a room for one night at Marina Bay Sands and our time spent there was just perfect.  The room was nice, large, and most importantly, it had a great view of the city.  Dinner at Lavo was excellent and our server, LALO, was great!!  Very friendly, very fast service, and very accommodating.  The pool was, of course, the highlight of the trip - awesome views, drink service was solid.  Lastly, thanks to ""UNCLE RYAN"" for taking some fun pictures of us by the pool  in the morning.  Thanks!!  J",5,September 2019,
Amazing views. Wonderful service.,Donna A,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Only booked a basic room without view. We were fortunate to get a free upgrade. We were so impressed with the room we received. It had an amazing view out over gardens by the bay. It was stunning. We received special little gifts from housekeeping each day, including our names embroidered on hand towels. We were so impressed with everything about this hotel. They just went above and beyond with everything. Staff were incredible and we actually felt they cared about their guests. We received service here way beyond what we’ve ever received anywhere else. To top it off, the roof observation deck and pool were also fantastic. Not to be missed experience. Only hotel guests can access the pool, which makes it special. Loved our stay here. ",5,September 2019,
All that glitters is not gold...,Xen_Paul,"Of course I suspected gaudy but I hoped for some class too when we booked into the “boat hotel” as our youngest calls it. Sadly there was lots of the former and very little of the latter at MBS. True the view is stunning. The architecture astounding. But the options for dining, drinking and relaxing seem suited to a raucous crowd able to behave any way they please: Young kids in adult only spa and swimming areas. People Spitting over the sides of the jacuzzi. Smoking despite signs to the contrary.  Eating food and dropping it in the pool. All this without consequence from the myriad pool side staff. It seems as long as you have a room pass to get through security you can do whatever you like. Couple all this with loud competing music from two bar/restaurant venues only a stones…",3,September 2019,
Memorable Stay,JDH741,"We stayed at the MBS for two nights in a ""Deluxe King Sky View"" room. Indeed, the skyline views were amazing! I would highly recommend that you spend the extra $$ for a higher floor... the views will not disappoint! The room was spacious and well appointed; however, I'm subtracting a dot because some of the furniture and décor seemed a bit dated. The rooftop pool is obviously the main attraction of the hotel, and I had a wonderful time soaking in the sunshine and taking in the nice views. I appreciated that there were plenty of lifeguards and security personnel available.  We opted not to purchase the breakfast and decided to explore the various dining options located in the attached shopping mall. There were a number of restaurants ranging from low-end food court to higher-end…",4,July 2019,
"Unprofessional , Ridiculous ",Amy,"I was charged over SGD$2300 by Marina Bay Sands without any authorisations or my consent.Yes,after numerous calls and emails,they “realised their mistake” and gave me a refund after 80 days but without the extra charges due to this so called “mistake”. A General Manager told me to speak to the bank to waive all the charges.and told me they have the right to charge their guest within 6mths after check out.",1,September 2019,
Amazing hotel,rgoold,You can certainly see what this hotel is rated one of the best in Singapore and with the best rooftop pool in the world.  The bars and clubs are good too.  Marquee is definitely worth a visit and if you are a hotel resident then you can ask them to put you on the guest list.,5,September 2019,

Amazing stay at the Marina Bay Sands,akusky808,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel when I visited Singapore; and, I will say it is a fine hotel.  When my friend and I arrived at the hotel roughly around 1pm, we ushered to check in by the bellhops.  We had assumption that our room would not be ready since we were earlier than the stated check-in time. However,  to our surprise, it was.  I saw this as a fortuitous sign to begin a fantastic holiday in Singapore.  We had a premier city view room with overlooked the beautiful Singapore city skyline.  The view from the room was spectacular, and it looked 100% better at night.  There is nothing like gazing out into the night and being astonished by the different lights illuminating in the dark.  As I tell my friends, everything looks better in the…",5,September 2019,

It is extremely comfortable, our room was on the seventh floor with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay Area, we could even watch the nightly light show from our bed. Our deluxe room had a very comfortable king sized bed, beautiful wet room style bathroom with large shower and sink area. The room was very quiet so much so it felt like we were the only ones on the floor, didn’t hear a single noise.

Amazing,TracyCollard,"Stayed here for 2 nights on our way to Australia.  The hotel is amazing, the staff are so helpful and friendly and as for the infinity pool, wow, it is worth every penny for that view.  The rooms are lovely and big and the service is second to none.  Join the Sands loyalty card through the hotels website and you will get discount in the restaurant and other places in the area, definitely worth it.  Singapore is very expensive so be prepared and you will have the best time!  There are so many attractions within walking distance which makes it a fantastic location. You can’t come to Singapore and not stay here. We will be back",5,September 2019,
Pool is WOW,travelbirdette,Such an amazing hotel. A nice surprise was the view from the roof deck away from the city. You could see Indonesian islands and the sea was gorgeous. There were also multiple hot tubs on that side. The room was very large and well appointed.,5,March 2019,
Overrated Infinity Pool,Erick Shih,"We were apparently “upgraded” from premiere deluxe twin room bed city view to
sky view king bed that was just around 25
SGD difference only due to “defective” room availability and their full housed status, which we didn't really opted in the first place since we really wanted the city view experience, we were just provided with an extra folding bed for my 3rd companion, though, an extra 1 hr was given to us for check-out time, there's no toilet bidet available as well; otherwise, everything was just fine.   Though, the sky view was breathtaking so it's just totally a good experience, express check-out option was nice to compensate the waiting time we've spent during check-in.  ",3,August 2019,

Charme of a tube station at rush hour,Rolf,"While the rooms are fine and offer an excellent view to the harbor or the bay, the hotel lobby is crowded all times like a tube station at rush hour.

Disappointing,Ana,"I’m very surprised at the positive feedback for this hotel. The rooms are very ordinary, the pool is crowded, and the service is really poor. I expected so much better. Because the hotel is full all year, it’s as if they don’t need to make the effort. Much better to go to mandarin oriental where the quality is really 5*",2,September 2019,
Railway Stations are easier,Maurice Healy,I was there to attend VitaFoods. From the time I arrived by taxi and got checked in took 2 hours 45 mins. The WiFi is terrible and you may have to log in 20 times per day as it does not retain your data. Staff are not friendly and your just a number. Never again,1,September 2019,
Just visited but well worth it!,Chrisinkingwood2,This is one amazing upscale hotel. We just stopped in for a look in the lobby and surrounding areas. It is really spectacular both inside and out! The iconic boat shaped upper deck holds restaurants and an infinity pool.,4,September 2019,
A must Do!,Clayton,"My partner and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for the 1 night at the end of our trip. Our experience could not have been any better. Our Deluxe Skyview room was Jaw dropping and breakfast at Rise was a must do. The infinity pool was great and it was hard to get out of the water. It's so worth it to stay here, even just for the 1 night!",5,September 2019,
Bucket List - Tick,Panda_eyes2,We visited Singapore for 3 nights and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands. The room was on the 45th floor. Check in was relatively quick (arrived about 9pm).  It is a central location. The hotel itself exceeds expectations. The infinity pool is fantastic! Plenty of seating. We ate breakfast at two of the restaurants Adrift & Rise - both were good. We also ate at Cest La Vie - you need to book this in advance.   We did tell them that we had just got married it would of been nice for them to acknowledge this - as I see others got birthday cakes etc.,5,September 2019,
Have to try at least once,Tassie1301,"We stayed for 2 nights and the service everywhere was exceptional from check-in, housekeeping, Club 55 staff, pool & gym. You really do not need to leave with a wide choice of restaurants, shopping and Gardens by the Bay within a few minutes walk.  As the visit coincided with our anniversary, a small cake was delivered to our room during the afternoon which was a lovely touch.  The only negative is the sheer size of the property which makes the lifts a nightmare. So many guests would comment with “I won’t miss the lifts”. ",5,September 2019,
Amazing!!,jakeonbacon,"We visited the Spago bar at the infinity pool on top of tower 2 to see the view and have a few drinks. It was amazing. Also, we avoided the admission fee to the deck in tower 3 by going to this rooftop bar in tower 2 instead, and still get the same view. Highly recommend.",5,September 2019,
OMG!!!,Mel J,"We were staying in Singapore for 6 nights, so for my husbands birthday I booked one night here, it was amazing and all we wanted it to be!!!  A downside was check in, we had to wait almost one hour to check in and it seemed as though the staff were not keen on keeping the que moving!     Once we got to our room though, this was forgotten!   It was a lovely room and as you entered the curtains opened to expose a fantastic view, we had the 41st floor.  Our room here was over 3 times bigger than our other in Singapore!!!

Iconic!,Alicia,"We stayed here for 5 nights and I don’t think there is anything that I can say about this hotel that hasn’t been mentioned in the thousands of previous reviews.   Yes, the hotel is huge. Yes, the check-in queues can take a little while (we didn’t personally experience this, but we did see lines at different times) Yes, the pool is busy. Yes, it was a little bit on the pricey side   BUT not a single one of these things affected our experience. We absolutely loved it.   We received fantastic service from every single staff member we encountered, from Jerry at check in to Jing Xiao who made up our room daily.

Simply incredible!,Brayden C,"Stayed here for one night in September in a Deluxe Room - Sky View. Room was on the 43rd floor in tower 3 with a city view, massive room including a seperate lounge area as well as a very large bathroom and a king bed. Obviously the main attraction to staying at this hotel is the infinity pool on the rooftop of the iconic building. Big pool with heaps of seating spaces with the ability to order drinks and food straight to your poolside location. There are also two or three separate places on the roof to eat and drink not in the pool area. Everything is very very expensive as you could imagine but worth it for a one night experience stay. Long check-in and check-out lines so make sure you plan accordingly, luggage storage also available although delays were experienced with…",5,September 2019,
Nice Stay but Disappointed with the Balcony in the Room,JQ365,"We booked Premier Room with Garden View and it comes with balcony. Was happy with the room until night time when we realised the light bulbs at the balcony was missing, hence my dad had to smoke in the dark which make it very inconvenient and unsafe for senior. It is very disappointing and didn't expect this thing to happen in MBS. Other than this, the room is nice and comfy.",3,August 2019,
Formula 1 Racing Experience,Shawn S,"Having stayed at many hotels across the globe, this easily rate as one of the best I have ever stayed in. Make no mistake, Singapore is very expensive, but somehow the hotel made it feel value for money. Every single need is attended to and instantly. For example, our safe stopped working late one evening and a single call had someone at our room in minutes to have it sorted out. I can honestly say that is the first hotel where I have had no slippage of any need. Rooms were made up on time and no need to call to replace towels or get water. Simple things, but clearly the hotel follows a policy of doing things right the first time.  The hotel is big, but even over this busy weekend attention to detail and making us feel important reigned. Also a huge plus was it's integration…",5,September 2019,
Unique!!!!,Dr_Taniman,You simply can’t afford a visit in Singapore without staying at least once in this beauty! An architectural marvel by its self in the most iconic spot of the city & with a view from the pool you just can’t have anywhere else!!!,5,September 2019,
Service doesn’t live up to the price tag,Mitch D,"Facilities are amazing, it’s just a let down the service doesn’t live up to the architecture. My card didn’t work to access the pool, it was as though I was trying to scam my way in. Waited 35 mins for a beer. Not what you’d expect for $700 p/n + ",1,September 2019,
"Good, but slightly dated ",Malte Boetel,"Hotel has two things going for it: great location and incredible pool. However, overall facilities are now slightly dated and worn and surcharges for F1 weekend are ridiculous. As a hotel guest S$68 entrance fee for the bar to be able to buy drinks is a rip off, of you already S$800/night.  ",4,September 2019,
Luxury,Michelle,We loved staying here! We had a room on the 50th floor. The staff is excellent and very professional. They give you lots of water in your roooms. The pool is very busy but stunning. You have to use your room keys for everything. This is a must stay place if you enjoy luxury. It is similar to Vegas in that everything is very busy!,5,September 2019,
Luxury,Cheryl M,"This place is just busy, busy, busy! The hotel is amazing! The swimming pool even more so!! We had a room on the 40th floor with a view of Gardens by the bay. Room was nice and spacious. Lovely bathroom. Towels were amazingly soft. We decided to pay for the buffet breakfast one morning! Staff were lovely and definitely a lot of variety. Lovely touches - such as a cake for our anniversary. All in all lovely place to stay! Worth a stay at least once in your life!!",5,September 2019,
Marina Bay Sands,Herbertreno,"This place is a hotel and shopping place with a famous brand.  Besides having a place to eat, in this place there is a lot of entertainment.  One of them is Digital Light Canvas.  By paying $ 5 per person, your can enters the area where the floor will be decorated with digital lights.  This place is perfect for small children.  Children under 7 years must be accompanied by parents.  So parents must pay and enter.",5,September 2019,
A great experience!,Lara_phototraveller,We stayed here for 2 nights in may! Enjoyed a great morning swim with the best view at dawn. Loved having breakfast by the pool at sunrise! This felt unique.

I didn’t know my partner had planned to propose and spoken to the hotel in advance, because of this they arranged a room upgrade at not extra cost and VIP check in, as well as complimentary chocolates, Wine , macaroons and room decoration all because he emailed to explain he was going to propose!   The hotel infinity pool is sensational, it does get busy however the staff can’t do enough to ensure you are waited on hand and foot at the poolside!

Fabulous stay in a suite...,Lara Osgood,"My other half booked us a suite at the MBS hotel and also took the upgrade to the MBS Club.  The hotel is superb and the views are breath taking.  Rooms are large, spacious and quiet and there’s a great selection of shops and restaurants in this vast hotel.  We had a dinner reservation but enjoyed the drinks and canapés at the Club so much that we didn’t make it to dinner.  A great place to stay and an ideal base for seeing the city,",5,April 2019,
A special location,WOJD64,Let’s not beat around the bush this is a luxury hotel. But unfortunately it’s also a tourist attraction so the lobby is always crowded with people going up to the sky deck. The pool was great. The proximity to the MRT is also convenient. Unless you are happy to eat at the hotel it’s quite a walk for other choices,4,September 2019,
Best hotel I’ve ever stayed at,kathi,"My husband and I stayed here for a layover on our way home. We couldn’t have had a better experience.  All staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We got upgraded as we were on our honeymoon and even got a late check out, which meant we were able to enjoy the pool even on the day of our check out until 1pm. The rooms are incredible - super clean, fantastic views and beautifully decorated. The pool was fantastic too - the views are incredible and the cocktails very tasty (and not even that expensive compared to Australian alcohol prices). We also loved being able to leave our luggage at the hotel after checking out and being able to shower at the gym in the evening before heading back to the airport.   Honestly, we had the most incredible experience and will definitely stay…",5,September 2019,
Mega Property with World Class Attention to Detail,Sid R,"Came for a 3 day stay as part of our honeymoon. We had flown in after a wonderful stay at the Mandapa Ritz Carlton Reserve in Bali which we thought could not be beat. We had stayed in all the great Vegas hotels before and were expecting a similar experience from MBS.  However, we were so surprised by the level of service. The wonderful Charmaine Ho took great care of us, arranged a transfer from the airport, and had us ushered without check in directly to our enormous corner Orchid suite on the 53rd floor. This one was special in that it had a spectacular view of the city on one end, and on the other was an equally great view of the harbor and the sea beyond with its multitude of boats. Champagne, chocolates, flowers in the tub, and personalized towels waited for us within.…",5,August 2019,
A class of its own,Iray,"Pricey? Yes. Too many people? Yes. A bit obsolete sometimes? Yes. Worth it? 120% YES!  The location, the view, the outrageous shape, the infamous infinity pool, the enormous casino, the sheer number of boutiques, restaurants, cafes, bars and nightclubs in the complex, and the museum and gardens, altogether make Marina Bay Sands a hotel at its own rank  No matter how much you hate all the Chinese tourists taking selfies in the pool or harvesting Gucci and Louis Vuitton like buying grocery, nothing stops MBS becoming an icon of Singapore and showing up on all postcards and magnetic sticks  Probably that's why there is the 'Crazy Rich Asians'  Welcome to the future",5,August 2019,
Totally Worth It,Gary N,"Marina Bay Sands Hotel was definitely worth the stay due to the quality of the room, location, and convenience it offered us for our 3 night stay.   First off, there’s a train station that leads directly to the hotel/shopping area, Bayfront MRT station (Bonus tip: get the Singapore Tourist Pass for unlimited train and bus rides. We picked the 3 day version for $30 upfront but you get $10 back when you return it. We totally made it worth it). So getting there from the airport wasn’t bad if you’ve used any train system before.  The room was nice and roomy with all the standard amenities (including hair dryer: my wife hates when she goes to hotels that don’t have one). View was spectacular on the 34th floor and we got the side where we could see their nightly light show from our…",5,September 2019,

Over crowded.,SteIIa,"1 - Lobby was connected to this mall that sold high end brands (LV, Burberry, Rolex etc). So, there were hundreds of shoppers walking around the lobby. It was stressful. Didn't feel like I was in a hotel.  2 - The main reason we paid £500 a night was for the infinity pool. We wanted to relax and enjoy the view from the top of the building. We went to the pool many times a day, and it was always packed with Chinese tourists. There was barely any space in the pool. Even the sky deck (again, non hotel users) would always be packed with people taking pictures.   Apparently, you don't have to book an overpriced room in the hotel. If you pay $100 at the lobby, you can get a pass for the infinity pool only* No wonder if was bloody crowded 24 hours.  3 - Our room was at the 47th floor.…",1,July 2019,
Trouble with the thermostat,ri8a,"The room is spacious.  The bathroom was majestic, with the gorgeous tub, and separate shower space.  The famous pool on the roof was as everybody says, but due to the smoke from Indonesia the view was not ""infinity"" as I hoped.  The room was a little chilly so I tried to adjust the temperature, but the thermostat did not respond.  I did read the instruction and push the up button (neither did the down button worked). I should have called the front desk to fix it but did not and I had to endure the noise of the full blast fan and chill.     There is a check-in counter for Japanese speaking people and the line was shorter.  I had breakfast at the 57th floor.

Not what I would have expected,jdevine117,"Yes amazing view, for the price, questionable. When you pay top dollar you expect perfection, we did not get that. My perception of Marina Bay Sands is they have skillfully designed a way to get every penny out of you. I did not realize that my son at 14 was considered an adult so I had to book an extra room since they would not let my family (four people) stay in one room, strange. I thought we could get a roll away, against there policy, ok. I paid $900 American dollars for an extra room for one night because my son was considered an adult. In the morning my son and I went to the pool, we started to enter the nearest part of the pool, the life guard stopped my son and said adults only. I smirked and said Thats funny I just paid $900 dollars because he is an adult here? I…",3,August 2019,

2-3 nights gives you a great flavor of unique property,scubamom1234,"Architecturally speaking, it’s a must in Singapore for 2-3 nights. Book on line directly with their website. We chose a Club room to give us better access and amenities. Upon arrival, we upgraded to the Orchid Suite room. Amazing room and views of gardens! I recommend that you enroll in their Sand Reward card. There is no cost and it can give you discounts. I also highly advise that you request a room that will give you access to Club 55. Although you will end up paying more for that type of room, the access to Club 55 ( found on floor 55 in Tower 2) is well worth it for breakfast, afternoon tea( with heavy snacks), and evening happy hour with super heavy hors d’oeuvres.

Last night of our honeymoon,Sophie Price,"We stayed here for one night as part of our honeymoon as it’s been on the bucket list for a while. We let the staff know and they helped to make it special; upgraded us to a room way beyond the room we paid for (with amazing views!), brought a bottle of wine and truffles to our room and gave us late checkout.   This place is certainly something and a crazy experience. The whole place is continuously buzzing with people. The infinity pool especially - it is crammed with people morning, noon and night. The view is absolutely incredible and I especially loved the hot tubs facing the gardens by the bay. However, hoards of selfie taking people are to be expected and it’s not somewhere you go to do a few laps of the pool!  Whilst this place is like no other and something I think…",5,August 2019,
Never Again,Piscean,I always search for reviews on places to get a broad view of opinions. Everyone has their preferences and agenda but this place was just not for me. Stepping into this iconic destination hotel it feels soulless and like a crowded airport or shopping centre. Arrived on an overnight flight tired and vulnerable. Enter the upsell routine. I did not expect my room to be ready with early check in but the receptionist presented me with an “upgrade”. “Your allocated room is not ready yet but we can “upgrade” you to a suite at a cost in the range of $1200 for one night. Which is available now. Go figure. I reluctantly said yes. This included breakfast and exclusive access to club 55 which is basically a bad over crowded airport lounge with children running riot and couples. Drink up and…,1,September 2019,

Nice piece of architecture,Marie T,Walked a number of floors that we were allowed.

A lot of hype,paula s,"Staying at this hotel for my daughter’s 21st birthday and have to say I’m somewhat disappointed. There is obviously a lot of hype surrounding the infinity swimming pool that over looks the city: it’s fabulous and chilled up there when you finish dodging the cameras, but that’s all there is to it. The hotel itself is underwhelming, it lacks personality and style. It’s more like an airport, only at a slower pace. Staff could do with some training in customer service.",2,September 2019,
Customer hostile hotel,Brandon S,"The hotel itself is beautiful and on the surface staff are really nice. However it quickly became apparent that management only cared about milking customers for every cent possible.   1) Air Con is subpar. The lowest thermostat setting is 20° C but I was told the rooms would never cool to that point. During the day, expect your room to be very warm.  2) Everything here is stupid expensive. An okay glass of wine at the pool bar was $30+. I asked for an extra piece of bread once from room service and was told each piece is $4.  3) It was my friend’s birthday and his girlfriend had sent him a cake since he was traveling without her.

Phenomenal...,TravellerTH,"This is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in the world, and a perfect place to start our honeymoon and East Asia tour. The building itself is a work of art and we spotted it from our taxi well before we arrived, the excitement building. Upon arrival the colossal size and sheer scale of the resort literally took our breath away and the impressiveness didn’t fade throughout our two night stay. It was 7am local time when we arrived, we were greeted with a smile and our luggage taken care of in the blink of an eye. Check-in isn’t until 3pm so we were a good 8 hours early so we weren’t disappointed when we couldn’t be given access to our room, but the check-in staff processed what they could and made sure we had access to the facilities, with a promise that they’d be in touch as…",5,September 2019,

I do really recommend to stay in a high floor room, you can see from there the night light show over Marian Bay and also you have the chance to go up to the restaurant or observation deck ( already included in your room fee) and enjoy the views and of course the Garden By the Bay light show.

MBS Orchid suite review,Raul,"We stayed at the MBS, in an Orchid suite - garden view.  The suite was great, spacious.  We had two separate balconies overlooking the Gardens at the Bay and the view was quite nice and relaxing.  The suite was well appointed. The curtains (both heavy and sheer) were all controlled by switches, which made it especially nice.   The highlight of the facility was the oft talked about infinity pool on floor 57. While it does get crowded around peak hours, making finding seats difficult, the view and the pool itself were exemplary.  The only problem we encountered was of other guests stealing towels that we'd set down on our lounge seats. I don't know how the hotel would fix that though.  Service to the suite was exceptionally quick.  Every call we made, we had an in suite response…",5,September 2019,

The shopping centre is attached with high end shopping and restaurants but also a food court.  Buffet was exceptional but extremely busy.  The service was great with attention to detail.  Room service was great.  The pool is amazing but the amount of people make it not a place to relax. Because you can buy a day pass to pool it is full of non hotel guests.

I was able to book a reasonably priced garden room. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the front desk. Again, there was quite a bit of activity in the lobby area and because I felt that this might’ve been a more touristy attraction I wasn’t sure what to expect.

Stunning Hotel,WS1703,"First impression was impressive, with the beautiful lobby.  The lobby was however extremely crowded, with people loitering around or waiting to check in.   There were also no comfy places to sit.  We were lucky as we were VIP guests of the Casino and hence we could avoid the crowds and check in elsewhere.   We stayed in a Suite, which was absolutely stunning, with breathtaking views of the city. The infinity pool was beautiful but extremely crowded. It was a very warm day with high UV levels when we went so I would advise bringing sunblock lotion etc.    This place clearly also caters for the mainland Chinese tourist/Japanese tourists crowds and can get very very busy at check in/out times.

Spend a Few Nights at Marina Bay Sands,hostelguy1,"Marina Bay Sands‘ infinity pool had a starring role in the final moments of Crazy Rich Asians. One look at this place and you can see why. The hotel opened just in 2010 but is considered an icon — with a gigantic boat resting on the 57-story-tall hotel.  You might recognize the hotel’s rooftop swimming pool in the movie — it was used during the aqua aerobics class as well as the final moments of the film. We recommend booking a room here to experience this place.   The pool is only open to hotel guests and is accessed by your hotel key card (with at least 1 staffer guarding the gate). The best time to visit the pool is at sunrise, shortly after it opens or around check out.

Marina Bay Sands Hotel - experience of a lifetime!,KrisKnight,"Marina Bay sands is great for a fabulous 2-3 night stay - much more than that is probably MORE than enough!  The experience of the rooftop pool is not to be missed, and the rooftop restaurants are quite the top notch feel.  The room was good - and we were sure to get a room on a top floor with a great view of the Gardens by the Bay!  We arrived in Singapore a few days prior and then moved to the MBS just for a few days - and it was more than enough.  I find this the equivalent to Las Vegas - lots of glitz and wow - but you only need a few days to have enough!  The bed was a little FIRM - but the accommodations were nice!",5,September 2019,

Extremely Disappointed.,turboe30,"To say I was looking forward to this hotel was an understatement.... but in reality it’s completely impersonal, over crowded and a long way off being a luxurious hotel. Yes it looks fantastic from the outside and the infinity pool is amazing but as for everything else it’s really poor. It all starts to go wrong in check in, it’s like a trip to the cattle mart. It’s so crowded and frantic . I think they should restrict the lobby to hotel guests only because it’s such a nightmare to walk around. Then you get to the lifts where you   can be left waiting for long periods also. The room was big and view was amazing but was it luxurious...No. For me there was just nothing personal about it, simple things like your name greeting you on the tv screen when you walk in.

The elevators were a nightmare, long waits and fulled to capacity when they arrived, stopping at many floors. The pool deck was pretty unpleasant. So many people, no lockers to store valuables or places to sit and relax.   There also was no shallow place for my 6 year old daughter to play where I could relax.

Amazing place,Diago T,This really a very huge design and brilliant architecture. I couldn’t imagine that how it could be like that but yes it is. It look great than anywhere else. Every single corner has a well designed. So brilliant!,5,September 2019,
Top of the range hotel,Piotr-Suchy1986,There is not much to say. What you pay is what you get. £350 per night but staff and hotel amenities are absolutely amazing. And not to miss the view from 57th floor infinity pool. Just take a look at pictures and decide if I am right or not.,5,September 2019,
MUST stay in Singapore,Christine and Liz,"Everyone has heard of the famous Marina Bay Sands. The grand hotel lived up to its reputation! It is one of the best accommodations we have stayed at. Although we visited during Singapore’s busy season, the check-in was quick, easy and efficient. We were generously upgraded to a large suite with a garden view. We had a wonderful master suite, conference room, and theater room INSIDE our suite.   Tip: If possible, it is better to stay in a suite facing the garden. They had a fantastic firework display that we were able to watch from our balcony. The supertrees lit up at night and it’s a pleasant view at night time.   The infinity pool was breathtaking and offered a fantastic view of the cityscape below.  The location cannot be beat! The staff was attentive and exceptional. If you…",5,September 2019,
Surreal experience,IvaOB,"We stayed in Marina Bay sands in March 2018, in Junior Suite for 2 nights. The room was a dream, beautiful, very big with walk in closet and huge bathroom with marble bathtub and walk-in-shower. But that’s not the best- it was a view from 55th  floor on the bay itself as on the Gardens by the bay.  The hotel is a perfect example of the modern architecture, with a pool on the top (57th floor) where you can enjoy the view on entire Singapur with all of it’s gems from the water. Up there are bars and restaurants too. Down in the huge lobby you can find 5star restaurants that offers breakfast as well as fine dining. On a hot day you don’t even have to step outside the hotel - it is connected with a shopping mall as well as underground metro.  The price corresponds to the offer of…",5,March 2019,
WOW!!!,MJ J,"This place is just GRAND! in every way. You would think they are so large that things and staff would lack....this was not the case. Everything and everyone was on point! The room had the best views, the restaurants were excellent the rooftop bar and pool where just the best. It does get very full, but the best thing about staying overnight is that you can go up at night and enjoy a more peaceful and beautiful view! The staff and service were always welcoming and willing to help. I would definitely recommend.",5,November 2018,
Spectacular Singapore!,Betsy,"The Marina Bay Sands is as spectacular as you’ve heard. Several great restaurants on the property, a nightclub on the roof with amazing views of the city, a cool rooftop  infinity pool & gondola rides offered under other property right  by some of the best shopping in the city with stores like Tom Ford & Louboutin in the hotel’s mall. I believe theres also a theater but I didnt visit it. What more can you ask for?? This hotel has everything including a multi lingual super friendly staff with helpful hints for you so you can take full advantage of what this gorgeous city has to offer.  And Singapore has a lot to offer....great street food, lively culture, terrific landmarks but if you stay at this hotel you won’t want to leave it.",5,May 2019,
A great family stay !,Kapil Garg,MBS is a must stay for all traveler even if you stay there for a day. Its pool at the top floor makes you feel at the top of the world and the dining at the deck is an amazing experience. We even saw one evening Gardens by the way evening light show from our Balcony as we had a garden view room and laser light show from the deck Next day we saw both the show from the ground at respective places. Little much costly but worth experiencing once.,5,August 2019,
Awesome stay and meeting my old friends,Penguin,"4/sept2019. Stay in 2662 garden view for 3 nights . Overall here is much better then Sentosa 😂.

A beautiful and amazing location is the roof top view of marina Bay Sands,Amit S,The roof top view of marina Bay Sands gives oneself a place to have overall view of the Singapore city. The swimming pool at the top of the building adds to the thrills. An amazing and beautiful place to visit,5,November 2018,
Well worth it,Chris77B,"We stayed here for one night, so we could tick it off the bucket list and experience the famous pool, it was totally worth it. We had a family suite, which was amazing. One of the nicest hotel rooms I’ve ever stayed in.  As for the pool, it is an experience, but it is busy. When we went up in the afternoon, every sunbed was occupied and it is difficult to know which ones are being used and which ones just have used towels left on them. It then becomes a situation of people lurking near someone who looks like they may be leaving and jumping on it as soon as it becomes free. It’s great for people watching as everyone is up there posing for their Instagram picture. If you want to use the pool when it is less busy, try going up early morning, it was a lot less crowded.  If you are…",5,August 2019,
Amazing view,Darcy,I went up for the fireworks on singapore day and it was so cool. the price was good it was a shame we werent allowed near the infinity pool though that would have been the best. I get it though. very long line to go up,4,August 2019,
Hotel stay,dilip j,"The best in town and one of the best in world. We spent 3 nights here on B & B. This is world class and caters for all tastes. The views are fantastic and so much from entertainment to food available on within walking distance. The metro is cheap and easy to use for trips away. Staff are excellent. Real Thanks to Dziauddin Mahamud  the Concierge for all his help with a smile.  The real drawback is after a long flight the amount of time it takes to check in, it took us 30 mins wait just to get to the receptionist. Giving bottles of water whilst waiting in the queue was not good enough we needed  a quicker response. Please employ more check in staff. Otherwise an excellent hotel and really great staff but just not enough. This would be 5 star but for check in wait.",4,August 2019,
インフィニティープールと部屋からの眺め,Tata_2700,"船のような形の屋上にプールがあります。夕方や夜に混むとのことで、日の出前にプールに行きましたが空いており、静かに日の出のマリーナの眺めを楽しむことができました。早朝もおすすめです。部屋は１キングベットのマリーナ側の部屋で、眺望は素晴らしかったですが、設備などは少し古くなっているなと感じました。 There is a pool on the rooftop like a ship. I went there before sunrise because it was vacant in the early morning. I could enjoy the beautiful setting of the marina bay quietly. So,I recommend you should go there early in the morning.

An experience,Gl0betr0tter21040725,"The Marina Bay Sands does not disappoint! The rooms are large, well appointed and comfortable and we had a high floor and wonderful view of the Gardens by the Bay, The Cloud Forest and The Flower Dome as well as the port to the right and the sea full of ships further afield. The service was attentive, and the food options are great at the hotel and in the surrounding mall. Breakfast is a huge affair at RISE with multiple stations service Asian and Western food and a huge array of juice choices and more. The whole family was very impressed with breakfast! Considering the sheer number of guests in the hotel the service is attentive and efficient. And it never took long to get seated. However the earlier you go the less crowded it is.   The other thing is to be patient at check in…",4,August 2019,
Amazing views especially from the pool,Chris,Well worth it for a couple of nights. The swimming pool is amazing. The restaurants were expensive so we went to places outside which were much better value for money. The shops are really high end. My favourite was Tiffany’s.,5,September 2019,

Great stay,Kathy L,"We were treated to a free upgrade to a 43rd floor room with a great view over the Marina which was fantastic. Large comfortable rooms, staff all lovely and helpful, heaps of great food and drink options available in the building itself and adjacent shopping mall. The best thing about the hotel is of course that it gives you access to the rooftop infinity pool which is pretty amazing. We were there over a weekend and it wasn’t too busy, found lounges easy enough especially the one day we got there at about lunchtime. Very expensive to eat and drink up there but worth it for the view from that pool as your mind tries to comprehend how you’re in a 150m long swimming pool 57 stories up in the air! Was good to see the lifeguards strictly enforcing the no kids in the adult only…",5,August 2019,

We were lucky enough to receive an upgrade to a suite as we were celebrating our 20th Wedding Anniversary. We'd booked the Grand Club room, expensive but well worth it. I can only describe our 24 hours as a fantastic experience, an event. The pool and views are crazily good, you have to embrace the atmosphere and recognise its a popular, busy place........",5,August 2019,
Perfect hotel experience,EeKi,"One night at Marina Bay Sands was a great experience.

Didn't Quite Live-Up To The Hype,eightfoldpath,"Spectacular hotel no doubt - the on-site amenities, food & beverage and service were outstanding BUT bed is super hard and really uncomfortable to sleep on. Plus, there is no top sheet, which they said was the standard in Southeast Asia but that was not our experience (The Quincy Hotel had one) and sleeping under heavy duvet can make you too hot at night. Prices for ANYTHING on-site were just absolutely ridiculous - I mean really, REALLY excessive and unnecessary gouging! Not enough poolside chairs, so people were out there at 6am to get one. There is only a minibar, so if you want a small fridge in your room they will charge you $10 a day + you get instant coffee packets and a kettle, which sucks for anyone that likes a coffee in the room. It's a one-of-a-kind spot that falls a…",4,August 2019,
Experience of a Lifetime,Ricki H,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands for one night, during a short stopover from the U.K to Australia & it's a night I will never forget.  From the moment we stepped foot inside reception, to checking out - everything was a dream.   We were booked in under two bookings in Garden View Rooms and politely asked if we could at minimum be situated in the same tower. The gentlemen at reception said he in fact has one room that we could all fit in, if we preferred. As it was only one night - we opted for this option...  Little did we know, we had just received a free upgrade to the Straits Suite!! The suite included two bedrooms, two bathrooms, two lounge rooms (with grand piano), media room, gym/sauna/steam, massage room, dining room and a study.

Wonderful Stay,S G,We stayed with our 2 kids for 3 nights and it was truly and unforgettable and amazing experience.   We have stayed in many luxury and non luxury hotels in many countries so feel we can fairly say that this hotel is up there with the best of them.   I think some of the other comments have been a little unfair. Singapore is a very expensive city and MBS is an iconic hotel so you have to budget for spending more during your stay and be smart with what you spend.   Yes check in is very busy and there could be more seating in the lobby. Yes the pool is manic but to be honest if more guests put away their towels when leaving it would be easier to find a sun bed. Also some people bag them unnecessarily and don’t use them. This is a problem with the guests and something the hotel needs…,5,August 2019,
Nice view and beautiful place,Solidarity_L,"You will not be in Singapore  until you are at Marina Bay Sands. Excellent Sky View of the city. With the cold refreshment, we could feel the paradise on earth. We highly recommend this place for everyone.  ",5,August 2019,
Sky park Observation Deck,Jim F,Was fun to visit with a great overall view of Singapore. The infinity pool is interesting. Did not stay at this hotel but enjoyed the observation deck. The observation deck has vendors selling food and drinks. It was very hot the day we visited so these vendors came in handy. The deck is worth the visit.,4,July 2019,
Very crowded pool,Pulungan,"It is a very large hotel and without doubt the only thing spectacular is the pool. It is very busy. Regarding the rest of the service, the rooms already look very old would need a renovation.  The shower water pressure is insufficient.  It is a very impersonal hotel because it is very large. The wifi is slow  It is located far away from the city atractions except the garden.",4,August 2019,
Love It Here,CTMans,"Marina Bay Sands is the iconic architecture of Singapore.  Modern in every way - from the building materials, to the amazing rooftop park and pool, to the curtains in the rooms that open automatically upon entry.  This was our second stay and we had a small snafu at check in - we were early, our room was not  yet ready, and the hotel never emailed us as promised when it was ready.  It was disappointing but only a minor nuisance.  We received an e-survey to complete on the second day of our visit and when we mentioned the check-in issue the manager called us and went out of his way to make things right.  Altogether, another great stay.",5,August 2019,
Very nice rooms and amenities. Pool always crowded!,MicheleAustin,"The room and bed were super comfortable.

The pool is impressive, but quite crowded every time i went up there!",5,,
Quite cool - wanted more.,Jeebubble,"When you’re visiting Singapore don’t feel completely inclined to stay here. The most expensive hotel room I’ve ever paid for but yet I felt like the money didn’t go very far.   To clarify this when you pay $750 AUD for a room you expect to be blown away. Unfortunately things like breakfast not being included. By not paying a $100 sum to purchase items from the mini fridge with resulted in it being locked for our stay (You drink a lot of water and it’s nice to keep it cold). The films and television was also restricted for our room. These are all minor points however you can’t help but feel a little hard done by. In regards to the atmosphere, when checking in you feel like you are part of a conveyor belt as there are so many people and the hotel entrance is in the middle of the…",3,July 2019,
Upper end mass tourism hotel,Boris,"The design of the building is impressive. We decided to book because it had Singapore's highest and largest infinity pool. Unfortunately, it is surely also the most crowded. It suffers from excessively loud music, too. There is no oasis of tranquility anywhere on the upper deck.  Otherwise, it was very much like any other four star hotel. Service what competent, polite and rules based. Queues were ubiquitous in August 2019 when we were there, even at the premium check facility. No turn down service. Toiletries not up to a five star standard, etc.   In short, not worth the USD/EUR/GBP 500 price we paid except for the experience of Asian tourism in 2019.",3,August 2019,
"Beautiful Hotel, Overwhelmingly Crowded",Tim Willman,"The Marina Bay Sands is beautiful, on par with the nicest hotels in Las Vegas.  The pool needs no review - it is even more beautiful in person than in pictures.  The check-in process was smooth and easy, despite the massive number of people checking in.  The room was beautiful and clean.    The hotel was extremely crowded.  The reason I give the Marina Bay Sands four stars is because of the children at the pool.  There is an adults-only section of the pool, but many guests did not respect the signs, which were posted in multiple languages.  The lifeguard would eventually flag the guests down and send them to the other sections of the pool, but I found it did not prevent me from getting splashed by the kids running around and jumping in.  I understand that this isn’t the hotel’s…",4,August 2019,
Stunning Beautiful Magnificent,MrsFrame,"Wow Wow Wow, I was unsure what to expect after reading reviews on MBS, and after spending four nights I am pleased we booked into this stunning hotel. We booked a suite which was much bigger that suite we have stayed had in other hotel. When we arrived we were directed to a long queue as The Sands Lounge was closed, felt slightly disappointed about this however the queue went down quickly and a member of staff was handing out bottles of juice. We were checked in quickly and went to explore our room. Our suite had views of both the city and gardens by the bay. Staff were helpful and friendly. We loved everywhere we went for breakfast, Rise had a great international buffet, Adrift was more oriental and the Laska was amazing we also tried Mangosteen a delicious fruit that I’d never…",5,August 2019,

This hotel is a beautiful property suffering from terrible overcrowding issues that are likely to ruin your experience.

Great location,BarbsZ,"We enjoyed staying at this hotel due to it's location. It's expensive but you're paying for the facilities and the infinity pool is incredible! We stayed in a Premier City View room which had a wonderful view. The room itself is ordinary and not on par with the price but it's spacious, has a comfortable bed and the bathroom is also spacious.  The staff were all friendly and helpful and immediately fixed an issue in the room. The hotel is a short walk to the MRT and shopping centre and the Gardens on the Bay are across the road. We really enjoyed our stay at this iconic hotel and would definitely recommend staying there. ",5,August 2019,
Perfection,Maryel,"Marina Bay Sands is just incredible in all its features. I had a Garden View Room which was very spacious and enriched with all comforts such as minibar, hairdryer, slippers, bath products, bathrobes, iron, laudry service. The access to the pool os reserved only for guests of the hotel and the lunch I had at Spago was delicious. I also had dinner at Ce La vie restaurant on the roof of Tower 3.The view from uo there is incredible but the menu is not vary and prices are quite high... but the location is worth it.

An unforgettable experience,Frederic M,"We spent four nights in this amazing hotel few weeks ago, the place is spotless for the service, the amenities and the food. You can go there just for the pool, it is worth it. A unique experience just by itself. You definitely have to take a membership to the Club 55, which by itself gives you so many benefits worth the extra bucks. We were welcomed at the breakfast by our names making us feel almost like in a boutique hotel, the service is great in every aspects despite the number of guests. The quality of the food in the restaurants or by the pool is also perfect. You definitely have to pick a room on the higher floors (between 41st and 54th), facing the City, since the  view is much more dramatic and impressive than the bay view. This place is definitely a must do in a life…",5,August 2019,

The best views in singapore,Grafftey,"We had a lovely stop over at the Marina  Bay sands on our way back from Thailand. We were expecting unrivaled luxury and whilst the rooms are decent and the views from the pool extraordinary (so good in fact that they make a Singapore flyer excursion redundant). We also felt the hotel was far too touristy and the mix of tourists roaming around the hotel either for the adjoining mall or to take a quick look at the hotel ruined the experience for hotel paying guests who felt overwhelmed once venturing outside of our rooms (a similar problem experienced with the Atlantis resort on the palm in Dubai although at least a world class waterpark is the reason there).

Better than expected,Cedric,"We chose the MBS for the pool as it was my friend's first stay in Singapore. I was expecting a terrible stay and it turned out to be pretty decent.  Transfer from the airport to the hotel was very smooth, with an attendant waiting right at the plane, helping us to go through immigration smoothly. When we arrived at the hotel a nice lady was waiting for us and we proceeded to in room check-in, so no line at all, it was really quick and efficient. We stayed in an orchid suite in tower 3 on the 52nd floor with a view over the garden. Color scheme is dated, but the suite was in good condition, with heigh ceiling, making it bright and airy.

The manage on duty at check out said we could have had an additional bed.   The views from the infinity pool are great but the pool is EXTREMELY crowded. It took us 10-15 minutes to find chairs to place our things and once we got in the pool it felt like you had very little space to enjoy the experience.

The rooms are outdated and I would describe them as 4* definitely not luxury by any reasonable standard.  In the mornings our shower didn't drain, the airconditioning was underpowered and overall the room just tired.  Everywhere you go instabraggers are taking photos of themselves (particularly around the pool area) which is tedious to the extreme.

"Fantastic Hotel, a must stay in Singapore",BWK007,"I stayed for 1 night at this hotel in a family room, the rooms are more bigger than expected, the roof top infinity pool views are amazing, all the restaurants serve good food. I would love to stay more than a night but high price to pay. If travelling to singapore a stay in this hotel to a great experience",5,August 2019,
Once in a lifetime experience!,Eri Shimoda,"When you travel to Singapore, this place is inevitable to take a picture. Then, why not stay? We stayed in a garden view room, so we got to see the gardens by the bay's spectacular light show. Also, every Saturday around the independence day, you get to see the fireworks from the famous pool, which was atonishing!",4,July 2019,
Enjoyable family experience,Leopold,"This was a family trip to Singapore, combined with another hotel in the area.  The staff were generally friendly, and our room was also great, with a super-friendly butler and great views of the Gardens by the Bay.  Now to the cons: everything was really spaced out, so it took forever for us to go from our room to anywhere, be it the restaurant, the reception, or the pool. The pool was also  always extremely crowded (as was the mall and reception area) - and this was in February so I can't begin to imagine the chaos at peak times.  Bottom Line - Great staff, views and rooms but everything is far apart and crowded.",4,February 2019,
Girls Staycation,sky,"My friend booked a room at MBS, and we stayed for 1 night for a stay cation. The lobby was crowded, it was a Saturday however the reception was fast to check us in. I stayed MBS before when they just opened many years ago and I must say, the room is much older compared to the previous stay.  The area is nice, great for shopping and casino. Though shopping is more of the branded items. The room wise is pretty standard and you pay the price mostly for the location and the high end name hotel.  ",5,July 2019,
"Iconic, busy, must-do at least once!",lajoiedevivi,"Stayed here a few years ago (in 2013?) and again this time pre-cruise. Took a cab from the airport. We arrived early but no rooms available as the hotel was ""fully booked"". We did get key cards to check out the hotel pool (best thing about the place! Was very crowded though). Then got a text when we were ready for check in.  Free wifi was decent, with some trouble spots. The gym was closed so there was no area for us to change, but we found some bathrooms.   Room (king bed) was very nice, though felt smaller than before and missed some of the great amenities from before. Very clean and quiet. A/C individual guest-controlled. Nice view of the gardens so we could see the evening light show. Lots of USB outlets.   Bathroom was spacious - separate door to toilet. Lots of sink space…",5,April 2019,
Fancy,Gerald Dulay,Expensive pero worth it naman. One of the most promising establishment up to date. I only stayed there for one night but let me tell you the experienced is great. I had some issue during check in but the staff is very professional and fixed the prob asap. The room is simple but modern and the view from the balcony is out of this world. The infinity pool is a must! Overall the experienced was great.,5,August 2019,
"Incredible Check in, breathtaking views, clean rooms overfilled pool",Natfrank,"We traveled with our one year old toddler and would like to personally thank Mr. Lee Yew Kee, the lobby Ambassador for his warm welcome. Our daughter will never forget the greeting she received which was that of a real 5 star hotel, my best compliments to the service offered at check-in.  Rooms at the Marina Bay Sands are very clean, the views are breathtaking. The infinity pool is beautiful but overfilled, there was not one single sun bed available during our 2 day stay. One has to line up at the pool entrance in order to swipe the key card. This is not my idea of a relaxing stay at a 5 star hotel. Parts of the pool are cleaned during the day and guests are then requested to move to the other side of the pool, this was done in a very rude manner: you hear shouting and you don't…",3,August 2019,
The iconic marina bay sands,Kevin Gray,Stayed at MBS for 3 nights from staying in different hotel for previous 7 nights. What can I stay totally excellent from start to finish. Infinity pool is to die for rooms are clean I had 2 rooms me and the kids. Lots of places to eat and drink chose from. Definitely stay next time I’m in Singapore. Thanks you Singapore found my new favourite destination.,5,August 2019,
Fabulous hotel,Lisa C,"Great stay at a beautiful hotel. We were able to check in early in the morning after flying all night from Australia, we were very surprised and grateful! We were on floor three so not much of a view, we will ask for a room on a higher floor next time. The infinity pool is amazing and if you stay at the hotel just to swim in that pool it would be well worth it.",5,August 2019,
Life of luxury!,Amy B,"A one night must when in Singapore. Although on the pricey side, if you visit on weekdays it is considerably cheaper than at weekends. Definitely worth the money!  From being upgraded to a garden view room, being able to check in early at 10am and have access to our room - everything was spotless and worked like clockwork!  The pool is a once in a lifetime experience with incredible city skyline views and never felt crowded. There are also adult only sections. Poolside side drinks and food are reasonably priced and the staff are exceptional. With the pool being open from 6am-11pm, there are are multiple opportunities for the perfect Instagram snap!

Lean back and relax,all_the_places,"It surely isn't a cheap place to stay but it's all worth it. Checked-in in no time but probably had a lucky moment.

The breakfast offers a lot to choose from and servers are excellent!",5,July 2019,
Once in a lifetime...,jk2143,"Stunning views from rooms and pool deck of the city and gardens. Must stay for anyone going to Singapore for first time or repeat visitors... The city views are worth the additional charge, but the garden view is nice as well. The pool deck can get crowded and closes when storms approach.",5,September 2018,
Big Hotel big view,Frotripping,Our family enjoyed the use of the pool and enjoyed the view.  If you stay at the hotel you can use hotel elevators to access the top observation floor and pool.  Lines up flow quicker.  Family area of the pool frees up after 10 pm when you can get some great pictures and see the light and water fountain show going in below.  People do use the hotel robes when going up to the pool.  Despite the crowds of people the service was good.  The hotel is busy but perfectly located for most attractions.  We were going to stay at the beautiful Fullerton but opted for this hotel for the view and location. Train ride from the hotel is about 45 mins and is at the base of the hotel or a 15min cab ride.,5,August 2019,

WORTH IT!,cons06,"If you want a luxurious stay in Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is IT.   Having moved from a hotel downtown to this beautiful hotel was a real treat!  Let me begin with our arrival. As I was in a leg cast during this trip, it was a challenge getting around. But I found that Singapore is a very handicapped-friendly city, and so was Marina Bay Sands.   We took a Grab from the City & was brought down at Tower 1. It was only SGD 7.00!   As we entered, we were immediately approached by their lobby ambassador (Mr. Lee Yew Kee) who escorted us to the lobby lounge. While walking there, he entertained us with his own stories of how he had an accident (as I was in an aircast & he was commiserating with me). He also informed us that if we need a wheelchair, the hotel can provide for us. He…",5,August 2019,
Stunning views,tink254,"On our trip to Singapore, my partner and I explored this amazing city. One must do on your list is this amazing hotel with rooftop pool and bar. The views were stunning both day and night. The cocktail bar at night has an amazing vibe with great cocktails. Played a little on my fear of heights but definitely one to visit. Next time in Singapore this will be our top place to have an evening drink before dinner. Wonderful city. ",5,September 2018,
Amazing experience,Paolo D,It is simply a must in Singapore. First for the unparalleled infinity pool and then for the room view. It comes with a price too but it is worth the expense.  The only critic I can do is the WiFi that continued to go down.,4,August 2019,
Once is enough,marahsaliot,"Although there is for sure a lot of things that you can do in Marina Bay Sands, staying there at least once is enough. The rooms are okay–ordinary. The usual bed and bathroom with tub situation. Also, the bathroom has no lock so it kind of makes it difficult to use the bathtub without anyone walking in on you. We had stayed at the premier deluxe room (if I'm not mistaken) but I was disappointed with the view. Our friends who had the deluxe room had a MUCH better view, and they had a balcony/outdoor space. The pool on the 57th floor is also very crowded. I suggest you go there once it opens but I don't suggest you take a dip because the water is just treated water and a LOT of people use it every day (but that's just me.)   You get breathtaking views from both the pool and the…",4,August 2019,

You should visit it at less once in your life,Iano1996,"The most amazing thing of the hotel is its swimming pool. The normal rooms are not very big but enough for two people.

25th anniversary Malaysia trip,rawKent,"We had very high hopes for our stay at marina bay sands and it didn’t quite live up to our expectations.  We booked a garden facing double room and we stayed on the 17th floor.  Check in was reasonably quick and we were given bottles of cold water whilst we waited. The room was as described and what you would expect from a five star hotel. This place is a huge bustling affair, thousands of people milling around whatever time of day.  Very impersonal. We did call down to guest services to try and make a reservation for one of the hotels restaurants but despite being told we would get a call we heard nothing and after an hours wait in the room we left to find somewhere to eat for ourselves.

Great experience but not top end 5* luxury,Andrew G,"Great experience but not top end 5* luxury. The hotel is all about views and the infinity pool.

Strategic for various reasons,anditjia,"MBS is one of the best hotels to stay for whatever purpose of your visit to Singapore. It is adjacent to the Shoppes shopping mall, making it convenient if you get a room without breakfast. It is easily reachable at Harbourfront (not Marina Bay) MRT station. You can have business meetings at the many restaurants within the complex and it is easy to go around the city from the locations.  The room is comfortable and efficient, but do not expect personalized services as the hotel is always busy with many guests.",4,August 2019,

So I left my wallet in the room and after two hours (I was ald in the airport) still not realized it YET. And the manager, Jesse Lee, told me that I left my wallet in the room. I was shocked. I ald enter immigration and couldn’t get out. Was thinking to ask grab to pick it up for me but Jesse Lee sent the wallet by himself instead. This is WOW AMAZING.

Really upset,dawn,"This hotel has an amazing pool.  But I am very disappointed on how my husband and I were treated. As we are in the front desk, JEAN, who checked us in, kept repeating how we “are only staying one night.” It was very degrading. We are paying customers, and we don’t need to explain to hotels why we are choosing to stay however many nights. That’s one. Second, when presented with the room information, Jean told us that we have two twin size beds, my husband and I are on our honeymoon, I asked if we could have a queen size bed instead. Jean tells us that the room had something special set up already so she couldn’t change the type of room.  We got to our room and....nothing.

One night was enough,Voyage402510,"We stayed as a family one night before leaving the country. Very personal feedback is a bit mixed. Highly professional hotel, perfectly trained staff, unmet view to the skyline. Very good food quality, very friendly waiters. Of course pool and roof top terrace „a must“. BUT, it is such crowed - no wonder with some 2500 beds - and guest follow a herd-behavior in/ out the pool / terrace / restaurants in particular post check-in and- before check-out times. The staff permanent fights the towels and dirty which happens when 1000 people enter the pool in common. Forget about having a nice breakfast early morning at Stago at the roof top. Long lines even early morning, however very professional managed. ",5,August 2019,
Selfie-madness,Pleasecarrymedaddy,"You know when you go to Disneyland what to expect, crowds of people, miserably unhappy children, long queues. At Marina Bay Sands you get all of that. It’s so huge that you are a number, one of many thousands all going there for that one selfie in the infinity pool, just like the Kardashian’s did. It’s stunning, don’t get me wrong, but in August, when Singapore is busiest, it’s tiring to stay there. The legendary pool has more people in it than water and the queues for lifts, check-in, checkout are epic. The staff, despite being overwhelmed by all of this, remain fantastically friendly.

Hotel with a view,msdrmwn,"The hotel lives up to its hype. Yes, it's touristy, but for a reason. It's a gigantic hotel with amazing view of Singapore.   The room was spacious with great amenities.

Not only a hotel,amir s,"Huge and gorgeous building,well located and modern hotel. It's better to be called minicity.

Overpriced but pretty,Sarah B,"Easy walk from Gardens By the Bay. Beautiful mall to visit but the shops are far overpriced compared to Toronto or New York for the same items.

Great view,Chloe and Olly,"We didn’t stay at the hotel, just went up to the top in the day for some drinks and to see the view, which was absolutely spectacular! You pay to get up to the top, but the money you spend on tickets up is essentially a bar tab, so you can spend those tickets at the bar. Incredibly expensive but that did not surprise us at all, with Singapore being generally expensive. Would recommend to take in the view and take some pictures! ",5,July 2019,
A Gorgeous & Giant Mall,BreadChan,"As what I stated on subject, the exterior and interior design of the mall is gorgeous! We are not interest to gamble so we only took few photos then browse around and dinner in the food court.

You've got to do it at least once,Jun R,"This hotel truly lives up to expectations. We were a group of 7 that stayed here. As I was checking in for the group, a “lobby ambassador” hosted the rest of our group telling them about hotel amenities, providing bottled water, etc. The hotel has really changed the landscape of Singapore and has made the entire area a destination. The hotel has easy connectivity to the Gardens By The Bay, the shops and restaurants at Marina Bay, the Arts and Science Museum, etc. The top amenity of this hotel will always be it’s rooftop pool which opens as early as 6am… and yes, it gets busy but you will find a quiet nook to take in the views. They have a Spago on the rooftop which opens up at around 7am. Good news is you don’t have to be IN the restaurant to have breakfast. Poolside servers…",4,August 2019,
Spectacular,AlessandroRev,"Nothing more to add. Really worth a visit in Singapore, at least one night. We stayed in the 47th floor and the view from the room was amazing and breathtaking.

Yes it's iconic and I'm glad I can say I've done it but if I am ever in Singapore again I will not be staying here. I've had far better rooms and customer service in far cheaper hotels and this hotel is exceptionally expensive. From half consumed coke cans in the fridge from previous guests to very over priced drinks I'd say you will get far better value and service staying elsewhere. Also we ate in the ce la vi restaurant and the views are unreal, the service is fantastic but the food is average and they allow other guests in the bar to smoke right next to where you are trying to consume a top price meal.

Distinctly Average for Luxury Cost,Mike W,"Regardless of what I state here, lets be honest, you will book this hotel anyway!!  The reason is, you want to be in the pool, you want to have that photo of you stood beside the edge of the infinity pool looking cool!!!  BUT, it does come at a cost.....let me tell you what to expect. I was checking in via Tower 3, arriving, I was greeted by porters who whisked my bags away.  I wanted this to happen as this should happen in quality hotels.  With my ticket in hand, I entered the lobby through the glass doors. Hoards of people are crowding the lobby, my initial reaction is that this hotel has a lot of guests!!  But these are not all guests!!  They are public who are going to the public areas.

So much going on - like a Vegas Hotel in Singapore,NICHOLAS T,"There is so much going on in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel that it is more like a town than a hotel.  There is a casino, theater, shopping mall, gym, countless restaurants and it’s all housed in one of the most iconic hotels in the world.  We were on the 38th floor, with an amazing view out over the Marina. The room was modern and well sized albeit not overly spectacular.  Once settled in, we headed for the 57th floor, home to the infinity pool which looks out over the city  - surely one of the coolest pools in the world. It was busy at 3pm but loungers were still available one row back from the pool. Out of the back is another incredible view - over Gardens by the Bay and the sea. Just mind blowing.

Incredible view at the rooftop pool and amazing shopping,Ludovic4,A little bit crowdy in the lobby but the day and night view really worth it at the rooftop Service at the pool and in the hotel is personnalized  and high level Amazing shoppes around and inside and you are near the gardens by the bay (our seesight from our room at the 29th floor) Maybe the non-access at the pool the day you check out (after 11am) unless you pay such a mid-day rate is frustating in comparison to other palaces,4,July 2019,

Like a Theme Park,Burj Al Chino,"I was here with a family of 4 and visiting cousins from a nearby neighborhood. It was a hectic and fun experience overall.   It wasn’t boring at all because the hotel was like a theme park with shops and all, next to iconic sights of Singapore.   We booked a club room and got all the perks of eating at Club 55. The food was alright but the view was lovely.   Pro: - great new experience with infinity pool on 57th floor - hospitality was great - staff at Club 55 graciously accepted my family of 6 inside even though only 4 will eat. It was snack time so it wasn’t busy.  - happy with the Garden View. I had extra room to hang wet swimsuits. If it was the city view, it’ll be just a glass wall overlooking the city.  - Never boring. We can walk around. Merlion nearby - Food court was…",5,August 2019,
Spectacular honeymoon experience,LS18,"My wife stayed at Marina Bay Sands as he last stop on our honeymoon before returning home.  We heard about the hotel's wonderful reputation, and it did not disappoint.  The room was excellent and had a very nice view of Gardens by the Bay (including from the balcony!).  The staff were very professional and took good care of us.  Of course, one of the highlights is the infinity pool on the top floor, which is only open to hotel guests (there is a bar/restaurant that is open to non-guests).  We hope to return one day.",5,June 2019,
The BEST Hotel !!,FKK,"By far the best hotel I have ever stayed in! From the moment you walk through the doors you will be completely overwhelmed - even better than expected.  We stayed in a deluxe room on the 50th floor and WOW the views were unforgettable. You could see the whole of Singapore. The curtains automatically open when you enter the room which added to the experience.  The infinity pool was perfect as expected, you are able to use the pool until your room is ready. We emailed in advance for an early check in and the room was ready by 12pm as opposed to 3pm (thank you!)   There is so much to do and see in the hotel you could spend all of your time there. The mall is unbelievable and the shops offer discount for anyone that is staying at the hotel which is a bonus. The location is great -…",5,July 2019,
Only for the rooftop experience...,ANIY17,"Extremely expensive and overrated hotel. Lobby looks likes an airport terminal... We stayed few nights in July last year and it was disappointing.  The rooftop pool and views are amazing, but that is it! Do not expect anything else!  Don't expect the 5 stars customer service! This hotel is like an amusement park!",3,September 2018,
Rooftop Bar with a view,Buzz2020,"Well worth the trip up the elevator to the roof to grab an expensive drink with a priceless view!  Take a friend, the lights at night are spectacular with a dizzying 56 story tall perspective. Amazing architecture inside and out!",4,February 2019,
Beautiful hotel with amazing view,johnwtmb t,"This is the crazy rich Asian movie hotel in Singapore. It is one of the tallest building in Singapore with views to the ocean as well as the city. It has the famous Infinty pool as well as a club on top. Inside there is a casino, but you will need to bring your passport to enter. You can spend a whole week in there without leaving the hotel and still be entertained. It is a must visit hotel for anyone, but it is not cheap to stay there. Also the hotel is in high demand and you must make a reservation to ensure you get a room . Kids loved it there. Must visit!",5,July 2019,
Unforgettable experience at Marina Bay Sand,Wong T,"Attending the Marina Bay Sands, we were greeted with the amiable and professional staff, Reshmi. Where we were able to be upgraded to the strait suite. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Senior Vice President, Ian Wilson, and the incredible staff to enable us to make an unforgettable experience, beyond our expectation. Thank you very much.",5,August 2019,
Overrated,Neil P,"There’s no mistaking this is an iconic hotel, the question to ask yourself is whether you are prepared to pay $800 for the pool and view, of which both are magnificent. Our problem with MBS was that the other elements of the hotel didn’t come close to what I expected. We Checked in early and left our bags and got the confirmation that the room was ready at about 2.30. We arrived at 3 and the follow on check in process took about 20 mins. We had booked an extra bed and were told our bags would be in our rooms. No beds and no cases (everyone’s swimming gear was in the cases) it took 45 mins for them to locate the bags and get them to the rooms (wrong rooms) but at least close. Not a great start but at least it gave us the chance to take the kids swimming. Pool and view is truly…",2,August 2019,
What a view!,MHTraveler90,"My husband and I only stayed here for one night, our last night and we were graciously given an upgraded room for free! The staff here is very friendly and attentive.  They have several places to eat here, the first floor of the hotel, upstairs at the top floor (by the pool or at the restaurant) and in the mall that is attached. As mentioned there is a mall attached for plenty of shopping (expensive), there is a small hotel gift shop and one where the pool is (you can get post cards there and highly suggest waterproof phone covers). The mall has so much to offer, not just shopping, has a theater to watch shows like Phantom of the Opera.   We loved the pool, it wasn't too cold and we go very lucky where we could get unobstructed view and picture of Singapore without tons of…",4,June 2019,
"Vegas, except more crowded and less personal",Adam M,"I read the reviews before booking a night here and knew what to expect.  To be honest, I had pretty low expectations throughout, but I think even then it was worse than I feared.  Here’s the short version:  If you are looking for killer views of Singapore, this is the place.  If you want to get your Crazy Rich Asians on, this is the place.  If you love Vegas and all the action of the major casinos, this is the place.  However,  If you want personalized service, a friendly reception, peace and quiet, a pleasant pool experience, selfies without 100 other elbows in it, internet that that doesn’t log you out each time your phone goes to sleep, a functioning tv checkout system and a room that is ready at the posted 3pm check in time...  Look elsewhere.",2,August 2019,
"Great hotel, stressful lobby",SimonGsy,This is a great hotel with a fabulous infinity pool and great restaurants (both in the hotel and in the neighbouring shopping centre).  The room WiFi is good but the lobby area is very stressful because of the sheer number of people walking through - many on organised tours but not staying at the hotel - all day and most of the evening.  The WiFi in the lobby even for guests who have checked out is appalling.  I was at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for a conference.  It was a good conference but for a family stay I would prefer somewhere less fast and furious.  Still an iconic hotel though.,5,April 2019,
Just incredible! An icon of Singapore.,NZKiwi_sunlover,"We didn't stay at the Hotel, but visited the shops (which were very posh) & we wanted to visit the top.  My husband worked out that it was better value to go up to the bar & have a drink - as the set price to go up to the bar (drink 'included') was better value than the cost to just up to the top. From the bar you see beyond the viewing platform, plus also get a view of that superb pool ....! The views around Singapore from the top were just outstanding.  I'm wary of heights, but I was absolutely fine up there. I'd definitely go again - but perhaps at dusk next time, to get the daytime view plus sunset, before we left.  Watching the Supertree Grove lightshow from the top would be sensational.",5,December 2018,
Trapped in huge mall,Rebecca C,"If you want to visit a diverse and exotic location without actually experiencing any of the local culture, then this is the place for you. It’s a huge labyrinth like hotel/casino complex designed to keep you sequestered on the property, and to funnel all visitors through the adjoining mall. You can’t easily leave the property on foot. If you decide to walk anywhere you’re in for a long schlep through a huge, over crowded lobby and then of course the mall. Once you make it out of all this, be prepared to continue walking across a long, hot, outdoor bridge. Once across the bridge you’re still going to walk another half mile to get anywhere of interest.  The food in the hotel is fine, not great. It goes without saying that everything is a bit overpriced considering the mediocre…",3,August 2019,
Mass 5 star. Horrific. Avoid.,Swissbrit444,"I’m not inspired to write reviews these days - most of the hotels I visit give an unremarkable, value-for-money, 4/5 star service, according to their category.   However, I’m motivated enough to give this negative review of Marina Bay Sands hotel because I feel it falls despicably below the standards of a true world class 5 star. I think there is a new category of hotel - ‘mass 5 star.’ And this hotel is the champion.   On arrival, we are greeted by a bellboy who then sticks his hand out, none-to-discretely, for a tip before whisking our bags away. Poor form.  The Checkin is a 10 minute wait, in a queue of 50 fellow guests. That’s not 5 star, IMHO...  When eventually I’m served, the room is ready - a plus. I ask about a late checkout the following day and I’m told that it’s…",1,August 2019,
Outrageously good,maryjane573,I booked online directly with the hotel as I had wanted to see the hotel and infinity pool so much. On checking in I was upgraded to a suite which was out of this world. The infinity pool was amazing and the whole experience was totally worth the money. A fantastic hotel and memorable stay.,5,August 2019,
Worst experience ever,Filippo A,"My father booked a suite for us but the behavior and the attitude of the staff was really awful! We had to wait 1h before we could check-in even though we arrived at the right time. Then, once in the pool, we discovered that we had to pay 50$ because my little brother wasn't allowed to enter. The room was really dirty and then we discovered that the breakfast wasn't even included and we had to pay 40$ each one. It's unacceptable and moreover, when we tried to speak to some manager, he was very unpolite and rude. Unacceptable! ",1,July 2019,
The best hotel,alzourya,"I have stayed one night in Marina bay and it was wonderful experience. The infinity pool was awesome. We have enjoyed there to the maximum. It is very clean. As a guest, you have access to the sky park. The room is fantastic with very wide window. It is point of interest which is a must in Singapore. ",5,August 2019,
Returning visit.  A nice finish to the end of the holiday,Sharron D,"Stayed for 1 night but paid for two as our flight is an early flight at 2am.   the Merlion suite met our requirements with added bonus of a little in room gym and massage/hairdressing room.   The general staff and room service/butlers are lovely.    Unfortunately the Downside are   management who seem a bit greedy.  As our flight is at 2am we paid for two nights in order to keep room but still got charged for breakfast the next day. Clearly will not be here to have it.  So only one breakfast needed, no compensation.    You need to wait in queue for breakfast unless you pay the butler to do so on your behalf.    Pool so overcrowded and dirty   We came here four years ago.  Totally different. I think due to the pool having a great view this place has become so popular.    When all…",3,August 2019,

Nice place but very over rated,TravellingAus13,My partner really wanted to stay here so we decided on 2 nights which was plenty. People everywhere. Everything is extremely expensive. It cost us 45 each for breakfast plus tax and we felt sick after eating it. The pool was good if you go first thing in the morning when there arent any people. The room was very nice though with an amazing view. Could watch the light show from it. It was a premier sky view.,4,July 2019,
Underwhelmed and living on reputation for their swimming pool - and we had a Club Room,dorla,"On arrival in our taxi it took time to attract the attention of the staff in charge of the luggage. When a member of staff acknowledged us they took our bags from the taxi, walked us into the hotel and insisted that we join the queue for general check in despite the fact that we showed him our instructions for the Club check in at the Sands Lounge - we just ignored his instructions to join the huge queue and proceeded to the Sands Lounge Check In.   Our check in at the Sands Lounge was as it should be for Club visitors, polite and helpful.  We were fortunate to have our room available and were given our room keys immediately.    Our room overlooked the Gardens by the Bay which is what we expected - it was clean, comfortable and well designed.  The bathroom was a good size with a…",2,July 2019,
Overpriced,Dave B,"Firstly, I actually found the rooms very clean and comfortable. We used in room dining and this was very nice, with a well made table wheeled into our room. The balcony overlooking the gardens was great too.   The hotel needs a better process if guests are using debit cards to pay for the room. They collect $200 SGD as a holding deposit which is fine, yet they advise that this is refunded back and can take 3-4 weeks to return to the card. This is actually not ok. The hotel is keeping this money to earn interest and that is not in the best interest of the guest.   This is a very popular hotel and I know why. The pool is amazing and it has a generally positive reputation. Many people that are not staying at the hotel go there as tourists to check it out. This makes the foyer and…",2,August 2019,
Service?  Room phones?,OBIE1_13,"This long narrow lobby is a funnel that is busy all the time, without a lobby area to hang out in with seating.  If it's there, it must be hidden for high rollers.  This place is definitely over hyped / over priced, that's what you're really paying for.  Rooms:  Yes, they're clean, good size, basic, and fine.  My room didn't even have a simple clock in it.  For foreigners who aren't using their mobile phones in country, it'd be nice to have this to see in the middle of the night.  I know it's silly, but it's such a basic thing for a hotel, especially at this price point.  One early morning in my 3 nights stay, I had a work call that I needed to use the hotel phone.  However, I couldn't since their phone system was down for over an hour.  For the room price, I expect it to work…",2,July 2019,
The place to stay but not really worth it,Tesams,"The hotel was very big and the obvious place to stay and be seen. Staff very friendly but so busy that the service was left wanting, except check in and out which was very efficient. The pool was so busy with people posing for photos it was funny. Some of the bars wouldn’t let my 16 year old in so couldn’t go in them even though staying there, found that odd. Rooms nice but a little tired, as were some of the communal areas. Need to keep on top of decor when so expensive to stay there Wouldn’t return, would look for a smaller boutique hotel in the future",3,July 2019,

Over hyped and overpriced.,ozzalina,"After reading reviews and looking at amazing photos our expectations were very high. The Hotel had no soul and personality. Massive lines at check in.  Room is big and view is pretty cool. But not cleverly furnished and spaces not utilized. Only one big chair to sit in  - why?  - with all that space available. All furnishings looked shabby and tired. This place is due for a major revamp.  Cleanliness is very questionable but I could not put up standing in the line again so we just live with it. But kids fingermarks on the mirrors is not smth you expect at the price of the hotel. Lobby/hallways looked dirty too, like they never get vacuumed and properly cleaned.

I'm a budget traveller - so Singapore itself was a splurge but I HAD to stay one night at MBS. I splurged for a mid-high level room -- so worth it. From the moment you walk in and your room responds to your presence you feel like you have entered an oasis just for you. I did get a room over\looking Gardens by the Bay - I recommend that. You could spend multiple days at MBS without leaving the property and not get bored. Plenty of great food, unbelievable shopping, and a casino.

A massive let down,Inspire746397,"After booking to stay here on a two night stopover on our way to Bali, our expectations of this hotel were much higher than what we experienced.  Check in was quick and easy. We then went up to our less than 5 star room. The room was 3/4 star quality at best. Basic & dated.  We decided to have breakfast in the hotel. Something light as we had only eaten a few hours prior on the plane. We chose ‘blossom’. Quite honestly possibly one of the worst meals we’ve ever had.  The rooftop pool - being one of main selling points of the hotel - was massively overcrowded, to the point where on two occasions we went up, we could not find a single free bed.

ONE FOR THE TO DO LIST,Ehsan H,"after probably my 10th visit to Singapore, I finally decided to stay here for just 1 night. and it was everything that I had expected. JUMBO Vegas style hotel that caters to the convention/casino crowd.   we took a room on the high floor (not too high) to make sure we have a good view of the stunning gardens and ocean on the back of the hotel, much better view than of downtown. room was clean did not smell of smoke which was good. But don't expect any personal service here, you feel like you are in an ocean, we tried going to 3 of the restaurants serving breakfast and all of them looked not very appetizing, as if food was just thrown on the buffets to feed the masses.

From the moment we pulled up outside, every staff member we dealt with was a delight. We queued up to check in where a lovely lady was giving out bottles of drinks and mini ice creams. We were then lucky enough to be taken through to a separate check in area, away from the queues. It wasn’t even the VIP check in but it certainly felt like it. We were given our keys and all the information we needed and went to find our room. It was a real wow moment when we walked in. The room was beautiful - spacious and luxurious and on the 27th floor.

The room was very clean and the most enormous bathroom with shower and free standing bath!!  Like everyone else we were here for the pool and it did not disappoint!!

Amazing stay,eosinophil,"This is a great hotel. Check in was smooth. While waiting in line for check in a hotel employee came around and gave all the kids an ice cream and the adults water or juice. The room I thought was ok, nothing special considering the price to stay here. The view from room was amazing. The roof top pool is superb. A bit crowded as that’s why most people stay here. The view from the top of the room was great. Hotel even offers poolside photography. There is a mall and casino attached to hotel.

The rooms are fine, although the bathroom doors don’t lock and hardly even close. God forbid you bring 3 people, they’ll give you 2 twin beds and a rollaway. Uncomfortable is an understatement. On the way out, no one could be bothered to so much as hold the door while we carted luggage out to the taxi bay. And when I asked where I could catch the grab I called, I was ignored.

They keep everyone fed and watered. The life guards keep on top of everything up there. Special mention to the waitress mericil I Hope I’ve spelt her name right. The guys that looked after our luggage and were so helpful on our check out. Also on checking out we got a cold refreshing drink which we also received when we arrived which was a nice touch. Not being shoved out the door after our stay really meant a lot. I cannot say enough about this hotel. I really want and hope to return in the near…,5,July 2019,
Amazing,sunsetd2014,"What can I say - the rooms are amazing - we had a room in the 4th floor which overlooked the gardens which was amazing - especially for the light show, the infinitely pool - what can I say. Was surprised that you can always get a lounger also. Staff are super friendly and helpful . Beds and pillows are the best I have ever had. I would move in if I had the chance 😀",5,July 2019,
It’s like staying in a shopping centre,eugenegustafsson,"Pretty disappointed with our stay, expected luxury but falls short. It’s a big place so difficult to provide get service and it feels like it’s somewhere you can be seen and take pictures but not possible to relax. Our room air conditioning is so loud hubby thought it was roadworks. You cannot lie by the pool for too long as they are not comfortable with no matress. The wifi here is one of those that you have to keep entering your room number and surname every fricken time. Buffett queue is too long and in terms of choice no where near as good as other asian 5 star. Example hubby likes his breads and only option in that section is sliced white or brown.  More like a cafeteria. We have to check out by 6:30 but breakfast not available till then but they offer take away muffin from…",3,July 2019,
The best stay in Singapore,Edward B,"This is worth every cent to spend the money on this hotel, the hotel itself, the service, the views of the city and the gardens is awesome. Will advise anyone to go see the hotel and stay with them for a few days",5,July 2019,
Second Stay at Marina Bay Sands,Ashlay,"Words are not enough to express the feeling of staying at Marina Bay Sands. The hotel is classy, with a majestic architecture, vast and spacious. From the cosiness of the suites to the panoramic view of Singapore City from the Skypark, the thrill of swimming in the Infinity Pool, this hotel is by far the best in Asia. The Spa is excellent, breakfast buffet is sumptuous and the Shoppes are so huge for a shopping spree. Definitely recommended & I will visit again.",5,September 2018,
Fantastic Stay,Matthew Sheader,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands as a stopover on our way to New Zealand. On arrival we were upgraded into a suite Which was huge with a fantastic view of the city skyline. We also had a late checkout which meant we kept our room till 6 pm the following day allowing us to spend all day in the sky Park and buy the infinity pool. This is a fantastic hotel with wonderful facilities even the bathrooms smell amazing. Breakfast was fantastic with dishes from around the world as well as local treats. I will definitely stay at this Hotel again.,5,December 2018,
Basic Hotel in Luxury Dressing,Ralanda N,"Perhaps because I'm American, I was expecting more.  Hotel is muy basica.    Nothing to write home about and apart from the convenient location and proximity to attractions as well as the access you get to the infiniti pool, I would not stay here again.  Service was great, plenty of food options.  But I've stayed in better and I'm not impressed.  Don't think its worth the money...",3,July 2019,
Most Exquisite Trip of our Life,Day Dream Traveler,"We've traveled a lot and this was by far the most exquisite trip of our entire lifetime.  The suite, the infinity pool, jacuzzi's, restaurants, shopping, exploring, the gardens... this town and Marina Bay Sands will forever be embedded in our memory!   They were waiting for us at the car, walked us directly to our room to check us in while snacking on macaroons!  Top Notch!",5,August 2018,
Probably the most beautiful hotel in the world,Tamar F,"Stayed at this hotel for five nights while attending a conference at the hotel expo. Had the best time. Excellent services, spacious room on the thirty-ninth floor, and the most beautiful rooftop pool on the 57th floor. You might be familiar with the picture of this hotel, but only once there, can you understand just how beautiful it is up there. ",5,June 2019,
The experience is worth the price,christina_nglam,"A lady named Christl at reception went above and beyond for me at check in. I arrived 5 hours early, and she found me a clean room to check in there and then. I did have to pay an upgrade fee, but the view was absolutely worth it. I did not feel the room itself was worth the price, however the view of the city, the opulent bathroom, and guest privileges were.   Despite being crowded, I found myself a great spot to lay by the infinity pool on the rooftop. I was on my feet for majority of my trip in Singapore, so getting a chance to relax, swim, and bask in the views was perfect. Mary working with food and beverage was very friendly, enthusiastic and took care of my lunch order.   Marina Bay Sands is an experience I will never forget!",5,July 2019,
Will always be worth it.,Joaquin R,"The best hotel in the city no doubt. Not because of the staff service and room (which are good also), but for the majesty of the complex and the pool. I will always say the same, if you go to Singapore you have to stay at Marina Bay Sands. I can assure you that even if you stay at the most luxurious hotel in the city, you will always look at Marina and say, why didn’tI stay there. The hotel is just 15 min from the airport and the taxi is around 20 dollars. The hotel is perfectly maintained and the mall is insane. The best always.",5,July 2019,
Singapore Miracle🌸,Vera Vera,This amazing hotel is visit card of the city! Bars and restaurants are open for everyone but the most famous swimming pool only for guests😌ce la vie bar with pop music and city view!

Amazing Upgrade,Ian D,"On check in we asked for our three rooms to be close together. But the clerk did bet than that. He upgraded us to the Presidential Suite. And Wow just Wow. Over 500sqm it was amazing from the grand piano in the main living room through the gym (with steam room and sauna), the media room ( with karaoke ) to the hair salon and and massage room. Views in both directions and balconies off the bedrooms it was phenomenal. The master bedroom even had two separate bathrooms. The pool is amazing on the top and while busy on our first visit in the evening we still found a place to sit. The following lunchtime was very quiet. All staff were amazingly friendly giving a personal service which is surprising for such a large hotel. Taxi drop off was a bit chaotic but overall a fantastic…",5,July 2019,
Luxurious hotel where you can have a lot of fun,Nikolay Nikolov,"The Marina Bay Sands hotel with its Infinity swimming pool, on top garden and restaurants is an unforgettable experience. The view from the top is unbelievable. The casino is OK, but we were not attracted as we are not gamblers. You should book at least two overnight stays there.",5,May 2019,
Disappointing,Pegglet,"We splurged on our last night in Singapore to stay at the Marina Bay Sands. It's a beautiful building & linked to the Gardens by the Bay which is also beautiful. However it is very impersonal & very expensive (& I don't think justifies the price tag). The room was huge (probably too big) and the sofa bed which had my 2 sons in creaked endlessly. The furnishings re lovely & it does feel luxurious (especially the bathroom) - and the view over the Gardens is great), however even from the 9th floor you can hear the traffic noice of the busy road below. We spent all day by the pool (1pm - 8pm) and even had dinner there - the views are incredible. But it is so busy and getting pool service was a struggle. My son then fell ill at 3am throwing up & diarrhoea. I put it down to being in…",3,July 2019,
High class shopping and dining - The Shopee,Reina Yong,"Located opposite of one iconic building in Singapore Marina Bay Sands. Where is the casino located.Feel the experience of high class shopping and dining. Don't forget  to watch ""Spectra"" light and water show.",4,May 2019,
Amazing!!!,annando36,We stayed for just one night in July 2019 and gosh i wish it could have been longer.  We had a room for 3 adults and it was huge!! A fully made up sofa bed and a huge king size bed.  Our view was of The Gardens by the Bay.  It felt so luxurious! The infinity pool has to be the highlight and we took numerous photos of ourselves with an amazing backdrop.  The obligatory Singapore Sling was necessary although we had two each and a club sandwich and that was £80 which was excessive but we were in holiday mode so we felt we could spoil ourselves!  I would highly recommend this hotel and ask for a view of the gardens as you have your own private light show in the evenings!,5,July 2019,
Iconic but too massive for me,Robert-Jan1972,"Clearly the building is a Singapore landmark. The three towers are connected with the sky deck and unique infinity pool. All facilities are nearby with the gardens, the conference Center and the shipping facilities. That said the hotel is too massive. The lobby covers the complete ground floor of the building which make it very noisy and unpersonal. Furthermore the building is so big that it lacks a personal touch. Cool experience though I will not come back ",3,July 2019,
A mazing,Ellis T,Stayed for 3 nights. Everything about the hotel and the surrounding area is out of this world. You need deep pockets for food and drink though. Roof top is incredible don’t be put off if you don’t like heights as I don’t and I coped ok,5,July 2019,
Amazing,roisinreid,Myself and my partner stayed here to celebrate my birthday in the club city view room. Afternoon tea was provided from 2-4 and complimentary drinks(including alcoholic beverages) and canopies from 5-7pm. Breakfast is also included. If you are staying for just one night you will not want to leave the hotel and eating dinner etc. may prove very expensive. I would highly recommend booking the club room although it is more expensive it is worth it for all perks that are included. The staff were all incredibly welcoming and I would return in a heartbeat. If you are staying in Singapore and your budget will allow you should certainly tick this hotel off your bucket list.,5,July 2019,
Bit like Disneyland,SueM-Y489,"I was here for a conference and it was a good choice for an event requiring many people to be housed together. Glad however it was on expenses as the on site bars and restaurants are eye watering expensive - at least when paying in GBP. Good location, very comfortable rooms, though very busy indeed, such as queuing for breakfast table. My personal choice would be somewhere a bit more chilled, such as the Fullerton for this part of Singapore. However it’s a matter of personal choice and it was certainly an experience staying here. ",4,March 2019,
The excellent experience of dinner buffet in lounge at level 1,springluochunwei,"Happily to stay in very nice room at the 46th floor in this time likewise our family always be your regular customer visit MBS and enjoy  beautiful time here again. It's not only such a charming outdoor view for us to admire, but also we are satisfied with the buffet dinner in the lobby on the first floor. Apart from the delicious and rich food, the attentive and enthusiastic service of the waiter named Win has brought us a wonderful experience. Let us Really realized the highest quality of the MBS from the hotel staff, fully reflects the hotel's incomparable honor and status! We like win's service and hope you continue to hire such good attitude staff!",5,July 2019,
Great Views and Pool But Unsure If Price Is Justified,Jordan A,"Large queue to check-in which took some time to go down and no apology for our wait - Not expected at a 5 star hotel.  Room was very big with ample space and was very clean. The views of the Garden's by the Bay were outstanding.  Hotel was not too busy compared to others like the Venetian, perhaps because some attractions such as the observatory deck are separate to the infinity pool.  The pool is definitely the other highlight of this hotel, whilst the child-friendly side was extremely busy, the adults only area was quiet with many loungers.  A couple of negatives: Service did not meet expectations of a 5-star premium hotel such as a 10% service charge on all food and drinks. The service in the dining areas and by the pool was very poor and slow; Including one very poor…",4,July 2019,
A Must !,GorgeousV,"Superb stay.  Rooms average but the view on the top and being in the infinity pool was worth every penny ! We had fantastic cocktails.. probably the best ever. Made by a very knowledgeable bar tender.  Restaurant we ate in was excellent and good value.  Worked definitely recommend while staying in this wonderful clean city.  Our view over the bay, track and gardens was unreal ...",5,November 2018,
Would like to live here!,Lindsey R,We booked one night here to basically just relax and use the pool.  It was amazing and we had a great time.  I would highly recommend this although it is very expensive.  We had a room on the 42 floor facing the bay.  The room was great and service was terrific esp. the check in and check out experience.,5,July 2019,
Huge hotel with excellent service,nz_travellers,"This was my second stay at Marina Bay Sands and it was excellent again. We booked a VIP pickup from airport and were greeted coming off the airbridge and chauffeured through customs to our waiting van with water bottles, cold towels and large comfortable seats. Upon arrival we were given expedited checkin and shown to our rooms just below the pool floor. Huge rooms (although no bath), the view over the gardens from balcony was spectacular at night. Whilst there for business, staying at Marina Bay Sands meant convenient access to the best shopping and outstanding dining at Michelin star restaurants. Every morning I went swimming in the iconic pool which meant a great start to the day as it gets very busy later on. I’ll definitely stay here again when I return later this year.…",5,February 2019,
Loved it!,Essaouira,"We stayed in grand club room with a city view on the 38th floor for one night.  The room was fabulous with an incredible view across the city.  We also had a great view of the gardens from our bathroom.  We checked in around 10.30am and were given cards to allow us access to the swimming pool until our room was ready.  The pool was actually not too busy at that time and wow, what a view, it really is an incredible view!  We went to the pool again later in the evening which was busier, but there were still plenty of sun beds available. There is an adults only section at the end which tended to be quieter when we were there.  It was amazing to swim up there at night looking over the city lights.  We had access to club 55 which was really good, it was never too busy when we were…",5,July 2019,
2 night Stopover after 40th Celebration Trip,Alan M,"To cap off our 40th anniversary Celebration trip we decided to splurge at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. What an impressive establishment.  We had seen documentaries about it and had high expectations coming here. The result is a mixed bag, mostly good but not completely.  3 out of 4 staff gave us completely incorrect instructions/directions which cost both time and frustration. Signage is spasmodic and confusing. Restaurant prices are ridiculous. Other than that everything else was superb.  The room was large and well appointed. Rooms with a garden view may have a balcony (ours did) and the Garden by the Bay Light show can be enjoyed from the room  Automared curtains are a nice touch. The rooftop infinity pool is spectacular with many lounge chairs, although few by the pool had…",4,July 2019,
"Absolutely stunning - location, the design and great service",KiwiBruce2018,The pictures do not do this hotel justice. The sheer size and amazing design make this one of my very best hotels in the world. We had a harbor view room which provided not only the static view of the 'gardens by the bay' [absolutely amazing place to visit] but also the moving panorama of all the ships in the bay.. The infinity pool on the 57th floor was scarily impressive and a lot of fun as was the projecting deck out beyond the towers on the floor level. Totally recommend this hotel - not cheap but extremely well worth the monies. All staff were very courteous and helpful which of a hotel of this size is the exception not the norm.,5,July 2019,
City view or Garden view?,Siren2111,"I booked a room with the city view and I loved it. However, you can choose by yourself just search for viajero360 on youtu.., (the green person in front of a world) you will get a better idea of the views at minute 1:38, and 3 :)",4,November 2018,
Beautiful Hotel but no Service for disabled,LuisaT,"Our criticism: We traveled with a disabled friend who is because his cancer not able to walk.  We just got an wheelchair from the Hotel wich was very oldschool and very hard to push. And it also were so bulky that it was very to find a taxi where it could fit in. We asked in the Hotel at the Concierge desk for a Electronic scooter and they did not make an effort to help us or to find a help for our friend. After 1 hour discussing and argueing with 4 different People in the hotel, they offered us to borrow a scooter from the MBS shopping mall.  - we citicize that they only had one scooter for the whole hotel and the shopping mall because that is far too few. And we also criticize that we had to discuss untill they gave us this really simple Solution. That is absolutley no 5 star…",4,July 2019,
Once in a life,frédérique m,Mythic hotel up to our expectations. Wonderful rooms ( we took sky level and is really worth it). Swimming pool on the top is the must at different hours of the day and night. Check-in was fluid as we arrived earlier. They kept our luggage and sent us a notification when room was ready (earlier than usual time).  One of the best hotel in the world!,5,July 2019,
Breathtaking,kezzie40,"Although you do have to pay around $22.00 SD to get to the sky deck. You are given a ticket which can used against the drink or snack bill.  It does get busy but it’s an incredible place to visit, the views are amazing and so are the staff.  Highly recommended for a visit. It’s also a perfect platform to view the light show in the gardens in the evening. The hotel itself is also an amazing structure in itself. YouTube the Marina Bay Sands hotel build. You’ll understand what I’m talking about. Staff members are helpful even if you’re not staying at the hotel. Connection to the shopping mall and gardens is helpful too.",5,May 2019,
Save Your Money and Book Elsewhere,carminagirl,I had a very bad experience in this hotel. It's too expensive but the rooms are dated. Housekeeping/room service boys just barge in your room without knocking and they did not even say sorry. The pool has a nice view but the water is dirty! Not worth your money!,1,August 2018,
Best birthday!,Worthing Foodie,"Spent my birthday here with my mum and some friends! What a treat! We made the most of the infinity pool and all the views, and perfect location to get to the gardens, the mall and the merlion! Pricy.. but what do you expect from such a famous hotel! ",5,May 2019,
"You can’t beat the view, it’s just an iconic location",Rmkoch,"This is a really expensive hotel, and it’s aarguable that the service matches the price, but you just cannot beat the view from the hotel room especially from the city side (I really don’t think the garden side is at par), both during the day and at night. My room was huge, with two lcd tv’s, and a sofa overlooking the bay view, and all the amenities that come with a five star hotel. The infinite pool is usually very crowded, but it’s still really really worth it, by day and at night. I cannot recommend it enough. The only downside could be the fact that the hotel is very big, and treatment is a little impersonal. Apart from that, if you can, stay one night at one of the highest floors, you won’t forget it.",5,July 2019,
Best Place,Elizabeth Choo,Great place to visit with family members and friends 😍 Everything over there is so beautiful and it attracts me a lot during the night with all the colourful lights . I feel so alive being there as there’s a positive vibe being there .,5,May 2019,
Stunning Views,ScottNewZealand,"We stayed here on a Saturday, check in was a breeze with plenty of staff to process everyone through, one room was not ready but we arrived early, they sent me an email to confirm when the other room could be occupied. The room was very spacious and clean, the view from the room of the city was beautiful. The pool was not that busy and we had wonderful views watching the laser show and the fireworks from the pool. It was expensive but since we were only staying for 1 night, it was worth it.",5,July 2019,
Unforgettable!,Michel W,My girlfriend and I decided to have a short stay in Singapore before heading to Malaysia. We made a booking in this incredible hotel because we thought it's a must to stay at least one night there and it was totally worth it. We had a luxury room at the 41st floor with a breathtaking view to the harbor site. The hotel and rooms are very clean and provide everything necessary. On the top of the hotel is the famous infinity pool with an even better view than from the room. There sometimes are a lot of people but there's enough space for everyone. The breakfast is a huge buffet with a lot of choice and high quality products.   We enjoyed our stay a lot and do highly recommend it!  People who say that staying in this hotel is to expensive literally have no idea.,5,July 2019,
One and done,ShayshayTravels,"The best part about this hotel is the pool and people watching. The room itself left a lot to be desired, the decor felt a bit outdated, and the carpet was dirty. Room service was delicious and the view from the pool was great.  The check in process was slow, disorganized, and I spent 5 hours waiting for an email to confirm my room was ready, but never received it.  I doubt I’ll return, especially considering the cost.",2,June 2019,
Swimming pool is overrated,Mumofgorjass2,"The hotel is OK, room size is big, room service is very expensive, swimming pool is overrated too many people and swimming pool is so long, also if you bring kids you can’t really swim in whole area so the swimming pool is restricted here and there, only plus is the location, location is really nice, close to art science museum above mall and walking distance to some nicest place in singapore, but if you are after the view or the swimming pool is not really worth it, there are many hotels near by with some view with cheaper price, this hotel worth to stay one time though, but not sure if i want to come back. ",4,August 2018,
its nice but too expensive,jadedexpat,"apart from the design and the rooftop this is just like any other 5 star hotel. Maybe the rooftop pool access justifies the higher price? Maybe not? The rooms are fine, although nothing special. What I really did not like was the fact that even as guests of the hotel we had to spend a minimum of 1000 S$ in order to use the bars or restaurants on the rooftop. That's insane.",3,June 2019,
Outstanding experience!,Eric F,More than just a view and worth the price. Not only excellent views but great service and friendly staff. Everything is modern and clean. Good gym with lots of space and again nice views. The infinity pool is worth the extra price. Rooms are spacious and staff was courteous enough to let us in to the rooms early.,5,July 2019,
Needs to be experience once,861melissa,"Definitely more like a tourist attraction more than a 5 star hotel. The family room we stayed at was one of the biggest rooms I have stayed at with my family of 4 but the second bed, a fold out couch, was more like a king single bed. The pool area and views are a highlight and must be experienced. Service was excellent but check in a little slow for such a big busy hotel. Overall still a great stay just think it is overpriced for the rooms.",4,July 2019,
Great views,Stephy55,Worth visiting this amazing structure while in Singapore. Take a lift to the top and have panoramic views of Singapore from very high up. Bar/restaurant at the top. Infinity pool up top but only for guests staying at the hotel.,4,July 2019,
"Average poorly designed, not a place on returns to ",groovyguitar,"The naive clearly get caught up with the marketing hype and my family was no less a culprit. Rooms we had faced the Gardens by the Bay so perfectly lovely views. The hotel plys the room with lots of small disposable items as usual ..shampoo soap etc but not very environmentally aware or friendly which in this age is inexcusable for such a supposedly high end 5 star hotel.   To get to the gym or pool we had to go down across the lobby and then back up a different elevator..not great design.  All the restaurants are high end and have star chefs including Wolfgang Puck who for those not followers of that world, is a US based ""celebrity chef"". Pricing is suitably high. If you want somewhere different with much greater variety and authenticity, just in one of many local taxis outside…",3,July 2019,
The pool and more,See the world,"The pool certainly got me interested in the Hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a     great Hotel as well.

"Let’s be clear- without the pool, this hotel would be a three-star not a five-star hotel!",Tul A,"My experience during my stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel was very disappointing! I will certainly not be staying here again! I get it- the infinity pool is inviting for instagram photos! However, it is ridiculously overcrowded!! Certainly not value for money! I paid over $1000 for my room and unfortunately my experience of this supposedly five-star hotel fell very short of expected standard for quality! Upon check-in at a non-busy period of 6am, it took staff over one whole hour due to continuous errors made on their part, overcharging my card!! Throughout the day, service was shocking: wi-fi consistently dropped out and orders were missed! Very disappointing!",1,July 2019,

5 Star Hotel all the Way - Definitely Recommended!,Chris500,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from 05/10-14/2019.  Upon arrival, check-in was quick and effortless.  I was warmly greeted and assigned to the 19th floor.  My room was gorgeous, quiet, comfortable and modern.  I had a fantastic view of the harbor and city of Singapore.    This hotel, if you can afford it, is a must do experience. I loved it.  It has three accommodation towers supporting the roof top infinity pool (largest in the world), bars and restaurants. The view of Singapore from the pool is amazing.   There are numerous restaurants for breakfast and the one I used was on the ground floor, buffet style and it was exceptional, but pricey - $55 per person.

Well worth it,lebourke,Loved every minute at Marina Bay Sands. It’s hard to pull yourself out of the complex with so much to do and see. While expensive the views and facilities speak for themselves. This stay was well worth it.,5,July 2019,
Famous Marina Bay,Fuzar,"The area is where the most famous sightseeing of Singapore is allocated. You can sit on the rooftop of the hotel having drinks or visiting the restaurant, spoil yourself with the luxury shopping in the mall, or sit on the bay. At 20:00 there is Fontaine show. Skyscrapers at night look so elegant. Really nice place to visit",5,June 2019,
Great experience,nobaytraveler,"I was hesitant about staying in such a large hotel, especially one with a casino and mall attached.  Opting to stay in a suite, which if you can afford it, is probably the best way to go.  Traveled with family in June of 2019.  The staff was excellent and the I was happy that we were able to check-in inside our hotel room and the suites have their own elevator, so it cuts down on wait time and provides more privacy.  Happy to report that there was no smoke smell in the lobby which is often a problem with hotels attached to casinos.  I never went in the casino, so I am not sure they even permit smoking in the casino.  The property is beautiful and once you figure your way around it is convenient to the adjacent gardens, shopping arcade and food court.  The butler staff was great…",5,June 2019,

I loved it, with its three accommodation towers supporting the roof top infinity pool, bars and restaurants. The view over Singapore from the pool is amazing. The hotel was and probably is always busy but at no time did I feel over run with people. it seems to have the ability to gobble up people so you don't feel hassled.

Only worthwhile staying here for the rooftop infinity pool,Jibraan U,"The hotel itself is fairly standard, nothing particularly outstanding besides the rooftop infinity pool. From the outset, there were mixed feelings about the whole experience, the bell boys on arrival are so rushed and over worked that we had to drag our bags to to check in after 16 hours of flying and arriving into 35 degree soaring heat, the check in experience itself is hectic and feels like you are at an airport and results in reaching the counter and the usual form filling (I don't know why in this day and age we still do this, why can this not be done in advance - especially at a 'top hotel'). Once the room was allocated things did improve, the room was pleasant but again without being anything special it had everything you'd expect but nothing wowed.  As mentioned in the…",4,July 2019,

Spectacular views,Harm Engelbrecht,This was one of my highlights in Singapore. A must visit (if you are not scared of heights). See the city from another angle and experience the brilliance of the architecture and town planning of Singapore.,5,July 2019,
Overrated,LAX90000,"We stayed at both Marina Bay Sands and Fullerton Hotel on the same trip, and wish we had stayed at the Fullerton the entire time instead.    The MBS is nice if you like the Vegas type of experience. One night would've been enough for me, just to check it off the bucket list.  Like many other reviews said, the infinity pool was a zoo with everyone and their selfie sticks.    If you're looking for a true ""luxury"" experience with charm and quality service, I'd recommend staying at the Fullerton Hotel.  A side note on the coffee, MBS had those instant coffee packs (see photo) and a hot pot.

We had one night off from our two year old and decided to splash out. A huge waste of hard earned cash.  If you’d like to share a pool with a billion other selfie taking people this is your spot. It’s a failure of its own success this hotel. I visited when it first opened and the staff were much more interested in pleasing the guests. Sadly this is no longer true. Staff are just interested in ticking off the questions they have to ask and don’t care at all what you are saying.  Check in is like checking into a budget airline. Rooms are hugely outdated and the general feel of the place is pretty chaotic and underwhelming for the enormous price tag. If…",2,July 2019,
Nice infinity pool and a good hotel,Allexa89,"We stayed at a night at Marina Bay Hotel to gain access to infinity pool because otherwise you can't reach. It's a very nice hotel, with spacious rooms, diversified breakfast and friendly people. A very good hotel",5,July 2019,
Great stay @ Marina Bay,iRankin,"I stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel last week, and found it to be an excellent place to stay, with all the key amenities I needed for a very busy business trip. Staff were always efficient, friendly and helpful and great dining facilities at the hotel. Marina Bay is definitely my preferred hotel for my next trip to Singapore",5,July 2019,
"Lovely hotel, poor customer service",kevinmcg20162018,"My wife and I arrived mid morning and we had purposely booked a room for the previous evening in order to enable an early check in. We were told that the room had been let go because we were deemed to be a ""no show""! After much discussion, lasting half an hour, we were eventually allocated an upgraded room with a view of the park and harbour.  We went down to breakfast the following morning and were told that this was not included in our booking. We suggested that the waitress checked this with the front desk and she apologised for the error. Poor communication. The rooftop garden and infinity pool was very crowded but certainly worth a visit for the spectacular view. The in-house restaurants were of a reasonable quality with ""Adrift"" by David Myers the definite stand-out venue.…",4,June 2019,
AMAZING VIEW FROM ROOFTOP BAR,HarryNguyen,"We had been here to enjoy Sky bar on rooftop. Wow, that's an amazing view indeed, The miniature picture of the beautiful city that will be easily fit in your camera when standing here. Visiting fee for checking-in view from rooftop bar about $22/ person. Crowds of people who coming to enjoy this place, so that we would have to waiting in line to go up and get available table as well , nice experience",5,February 2019,
Great Location - needed more time!,Vanessah1979,"My partner and I had a surprise wedding the weekedn before this trip - it was never meant to be a honeymoon, but just happened to be a t the right time.  When we arrived at check-in the receptionist asked about our visit and I mentioned our wedding.  She was kind enough to upgrade our room to a garden view - when I mentioned that we were travelling with friends and were hoping to have rooms nearby, she also upgraded them! The location of this hotel was fantastic.  Walking distance to so many attractions and restaurants.  We could have easily spent longer in this complex and the attached shopping mall - but our time ran out.   The rooms were clean and well laid out.  We found the staff to be friendly and eager to help out.   The pool was the main draw card for us.  We were quite…",5,April 2019,
Ridiculous noise for a Premium Price,MancunianMonkey,"A guy in the very busy reception greeted me and took us to the vip check in which was very good.   Room 767 next to the Expressway and unbelievably noisy, all this for over £400, the worse nights sleep I ever had at a ridulous price.",2,July 2019,
Rude staff,Bustingpaws,Visited the hotel.  Went to bar for a drink and for the view.  Staff at the ground entry were rude and couldn’t give a toss.  Stood waiting for acknowledgement but the young lass was to busy texting. Unfortunately a common occurrence now in Singapore.  Drinks ok but again service poor.  As mentioned previously it appears now the current generation of young workers are more interested in their status than their jobs.  I have been to Singapore many times so noticed a significant difference to previous visits.,2,July 2019,
Excellent taste of luxury,kendoboy,"After backpacking through Southeast Asia, I thought I'd indulge in a bit of luxury in the famous Marina Bay Sands. Booked a Grand Club Garden view on June 22, got upgraded to an Orchard Suite! The view was amazing, the facilities are clean and stylish. Also impressed with the service, considering there's 2500+ rooms here. Shout out to the concierge, who helped fixed my SIM card problems and the amazing staff at Club55, who made me feel like a king despite my obvious hangover. You guys have made such a great impression on me, that I will be back for another stay on November 9. See you then!",5,June 2019,
An experience that will stay with you for a lifetime,Conor C,"I have stayed in MBS two times now and it is incredible. The first time I stayed in a room on the 39th floor facing stunning city views. The rooms are exceptionally clean and I was very impressed by the folded towels that would resemble different animals such as Elephants, Swans and Crabs. It was very creative and I appreciated the  excellent room service.   The views from the infinity pool are breath taking and I would encourage anyone who is planning to visit Singapore to experience viewing the city skyline from the top of this beautiful hotel. The pool is very clean and there is plenty of space to take pictures without it being overcrowded.   On our second visit we stayed in a room facing Gardens by the Bay, and it did not disappoint! Again, their was nothing to fault with…",5,October 2018,
Average experience,@PB,Marina Bay sands is a perfect place to stay for someone who is looking forward to shop at one of the many shopping malls at Marina Bay Area in Singapore. ( Provided you don’t have access to such malls and brands where you live) You can enjoy spectacular Views of Gardens by the Bay from a Harbour view room on higher floors. (and you would pay a nice price for this :) Now That’s all you can expect from this property and noting else......  I wouldn’t recommend this place to someone who just wants to enjoy the infinity pool as it’s always overcrowded and I felt it’s simply overhyped to be honest. You can definitely enjoy better views and overall pool experience anywhere else as well.  Do not expect personalised attention from the hotel staff and be ready to pay a price for food /…,3,July 2019,
Well worth it!,Marie,"We had an amazing stay at the Marina Bay Sands!

The staff (Concierge Desk, Check In, House Keeping and the Supervisor Guest Services) were all outstanding in their care and assistance. A beautiful place to stay. Even during our short time of difficulty, we were treated with respect & dignity. Breakfast is a feast unto itself.

Incredible hotel,jkaye42003,"Our stay at the Marina Bay Sands did not disappoint! We had a city view room on the 45th floor. The room view is incredible. Walk in, insert your key, the window curtains open up to a fantastic view of the water and the city. The rooms are VERY spacious and extremely nice. All modern conveniences. USB plugs for charging, multiple light switches within easy reach, and all of the other expected amenities. They provide 4 bottles of water per room per day which was nice. The bathroom is great with a large, walk-in shower and plenty of great lighting. The pool is just as incredible as one would expect. Each guest needs to carry their key card with them at all times to have access to the elevators, pool, and observation deck. Definitely recommend.",5,June 2019,
Anniversary Stopover,FJWilson,"Incredible location, building and activities available. Pleasant and efficient check in/out even with seeming high volume.

The Best choice in Singapore,Mohammed Marafi,"This is absolutely the best choice for everyone in Singapore. You can do so much inside this property. You have the mall, which is the biggest and the nicest in Singapore. Plus, the gardens are just behind the hotel, the infamous infinity pool and the science museum which is filled with so many nice exhibitions and galleries. In addition, the theater is also adjacent to the hotel which is usually home to a lot of great shows.   This is the second stay for me in MBS and this time, I got a family room which was just PERFECT. We all loved it. The staff and service of the hotel are just amazing. I really loved it and will always stay here when I go to Singapore. ",5,June 2019,

The side of the facility is magnanimous and its dream for many to be living here. For many it’s also a tourist spot even if they are not the hotel guest. For me living in this property was ticking off the buckle list.  The hotel reception was very inviting and they were quick to check us in in spite of a long queue, the staff is really well trained to cater to high volumes. A hotel guest is having a check-in zone depending on the room category, for us it was Tower 3.  ->Room: We opted for a Premier King Sky view.

At the top, which is in the shape of a ship, there is an infinity pool that is an amazing sight.  The restaurant there is excellent!  If you go at ngiht, there is a light show in the bay that was spectacular.  Since the weather is hot, the things to see are at night.  Nearly all the buildings nearby participate in a show of lights.  Unforgettable!",5,November 2018,

Reasonably sized rooms. Great breakfast. Conveniently located.  However, don't count on sleeping here: The hotel is NOISY, mostly because it's right next to a major road. We slept at a low floor, but talking to other guests I know that the noise is a serious problem at the higher floors as well.   Call me old fashioned, but I believe the first priority of a hotel is a good night's sleep.",2,June 2019,

"Ultimate Luxury, absolutely heavenly stay",Vivek Gupta,"It is always another happy stay at Marina Bay Sands, our 4th, including first right during inaugural of hotel a decade back. The luxury of rooftop pool with mind blowing views, excellent service of cocktails and hot snacks steals thunder for every stay. The breakfast as always, a very large spread, everyone prefers the main restaurant, hence bit of queuing though. Shopping and casino right in the vicinity, keeps you busy and happy. Tariffs are becoming steeper year by year though, yet if you can afford it, don’t miss staying here, as it is worth many more times .",5,June 2019,

Sands Theatre: A Mixed Bag!,BenMorais,"Recently my wife and I attended a Dance / Ballet & Choir Performance at the Sands Theatre at Marina Bay Sands. This theatre, to our surprise, was in the basement level of the Marina Bays Sands building opposite the hotel proper.  It is a huge, swanky and glitzy place with big names occupying many of the lots. Top designer labels were there. There were also, we noticed, a number of restaurants of some famous, celebrity chefs from the US, Australia and France.  The Sands Theatre itself was quite a reasonable one but not as good and comfortable as the one at the ' Durian ' in Singapore. The theatre was three quarters full that night. We were there on time but were regularly inconvenienced by patrons who arrived late.   We had to keep getting up for the patrons to walk through to…",3,June 2019,
Perfect place,Pixel S,"Apart from being an architectural highlight and the simply overwhelmingly beautiful infinity pool in the rooftop, this hotel lives definitely up to its 5 star decoration. Staff is super friendly and perfectly organized. All seems like a clockwork, the cuisine is wonderful. I definitely recommend breakfast here. If you want a view, choose Spago, if you want great variety go to Rise. Rooms are spacious, clean of course and decently decorated. They even make a new towel animal everyday for you!  The view is absolutely grand and you couldn't be more perfectly located for public transportation and getting around.",5,June 2019,
Best of the best hotles I have stayed at!,kagero43,This hotel is simply fabulous! great rooms with unique amenities such as a phone beside the toilet. The hotel has great shoos as well as fantastic service.  The best are the mall connected nearby as well as a casino. The mall fast food eatery was the best food ever had! Of course the MBS is also known for its roof pool which is simply stunning! Not a cheap hotel but still good value for the service and amenities.,5,November 2018,
Great experience,Evelyn Bensi,"I was really mesmerized by the view. Although I'm not a big fan of walking, the walk was all worth it. I would want to go back.

Average,Ruchi S,"Only plus : Infrastructure, view , infinity pool . Rest everything : Strictly average Average room , no late check out requested, instead we were told if we check out even a minute after 11 then we still be charged for half day.  Vegetarians food at buffet breakfast is what we strictly disliked.  No taste at all, neither anyone asked us if we would need something else.  I would suggest Donot stay , just pay for the day trip there , that's enough. For the price we paid, we found nothing extraordinary",2,November 2018,
Great hotel,JDC38,I visited the Marina Bay Sands in our way to Bali. I really like the hotel finally a 5 star one! The beds and pillows were great same as the view from our room. The Pool is amazing! I will definitely stay in this hotel again. The staff was nice and humble.,5,April 2019,

Well-run Hotel with Great Staff & Restaurants,LukeAHardiman,"MBS is a huge complex, above and below the surface, an architectural icon that could easily fail as a hotel by becoming impersonal, but quite the opposite is the case. The establishment is immaculately maintained and run by great people. We were checked in early after arriving at the hotel at a loose end at 6.30 in the morning. Got a great sleep in on the comfy bed and was up by mid-afternoon to explore the city.   The food on the spectactular rooftop is amazing - we dined at both restaurants. The one closest the pool  (forget the name now) was the best. The manageress gave us individual attention, and took time out to give us tips on where to get the best street food in Singapore - not something you might expect at a 5 star hotel.

Luxury one night stay,Daniel Amity,"Our stay at Marina Bay Sands was everything we thought it would be. I booked for one night in a superior L40+ city view which ended up to be exactly what I paid for. The room was very large, clean and had a cracking view overlooking the city. Staff are very friendly and one indvidual had gone the extra mile to give us early check-in and early access to the pool. The infinity pool was the highlight for me especially considering the good weather we had. There are countless things to do within the hotel and within the shopping centre. The only downside would be that as I only booked for one night it's hard to cram all the things in that Marina Bay Sands has to offer.    A very enjoyable stay!",5,June 2019,
Wow what a place !!!,Legaljulie,"From spying the hotel from the drive from the airport it takes your breath away. The staff from the door men, to the room porters , check in and waiters were second to none, all helpful and so welcoming .

Most Beautiful View,AngieK1145,"Ce La Vi Lounge has the best view of Marina Bay Hotel both front and back!!! You can spend the same amount of money to go to the observation deck but no food and bev this is the better deal! It's $22 per person then the money goes toward your food bill.

Worth a visit,Navigator,"The main USP of the hotel is the infinity pool and staying at the hotel to enjoy same was quiet worth it.  Interaction with hotel staff during booking and while at hotel was quiet nice.  After reading number of reviews it's better to book club class room or higher as you avoid train station like rush at front desk as there is separate check-in for club class and higher room and it was quiet smooth. It also give access to club 55 where u can have evening tea (2-4) and evening drinks(5-7) with marvelous view. Even though check-in time is 1500, they do allow u to use the pool and club 55 before that. Club room was quiet spacious and as expected had a marvelous view.

Room is spacious. View is great. Service is average.,Unalome W.,"As a flagship hotel of Singapore, located at the golden location, marina bay. This hotel is a must for us.  However, I think the hotel was too crowded, too busy, too business-wise for us. As a family of 4 travelling just for fun, it didn’t feel right. The lobby feels like a train station or airport. Lucky us we booked the club room so we had a fast-track check in. The shopping mall is good offering many restaurants and shops. The infinity pool, observation deck, roof top bar were too busy at all time. We went there early morning (7 am) hoping to see no one in the pool but no, there were hundreds of them already everywhere. The evening canapé at club 55 is one of the best I’ve ever had.

Worth it,Jonas,"We stayed a night at the MBS because the infinity pool was on my bucket list. It sure did not disappoint! Although there were quite a few other people enjoying the facilities as well, the pool did live up to the hype. As for the hotel itself, albeit MBS is not considered the best hotel in Singapore by locals, we thoroughly enjoyed our spacious, comfortable and clean room from which we could see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay. To be honest though, the main reasons to stay here are the pool, the view and the wow-factor, not the rooms. In any case, the staff was very accomodating. Had to manually reconnect to the wifi several times, which was annoying.",5,June 2019,
Wow,Erika Anita,What an awesome venue. The views are spectacular and the restaurants delicious. The infinity pool is amazing. Venture across the bay to view the hotel and lights show.

Amazing,Leanne D,If in Singapore highly recommend even just one night here. It is spectacular & well worth the money. We stayed on the city side on a higher level and loved it. The infinity pool is well worth the money for the stay. A must if in Singapore!,5,April 2019,
OK if you like crowds.  Stay away if you like a tranquil hotel,Ab Initio,"PRO: This building has become an icon of the Singapore skyline, and it is an architectural marvel.  All that does not matter match when you are in the hotel.  If you like the bustling casino-like atmosphere, then this hotel may be for you.  The service we experienced was excellent, both at the check in and at the bars/restaurants. CON:  Rooms are small and not particularly luxurious by Singapore standards.  There are so many nicer hotels in Singapore.  The roof deck and swimming pool are a zoo.  There are tons of people all the time and it feels like you are swimming in someone else's bathwater.   My suggestion is to visit the hotel and have dinner or drinks there, but stay at a nicer property like the Four Seasons, the Mandarin Oriental, or the Ritz.  At least if you prefer…",3,June 2019,
Club room,Merlot987,"We booked 2 nights just before leaving Singapore. Paid the price of a luxury hotel ($650/night !) while it is definitely not a luxury hotel.

Our room made us feel like we were in Las Vegas: marble, double doors for the bathroom, lots of space and great views.   Staff from Club 55 was very friendly and useful. The armchairs in our room and at Club 55 could be replaced (very old and especially uncomfortable).   Beware: pillows are comfy but bed is very hard.  ",4,June 2019,

A memorable stay,NBrid,This was the perfect start to our holiday. The hotel itself is spectacular and our room had a beautiful view of the bay and the sky park. The hotel has a lot to offer if you're looking for a relaxing break. The rooftop pool is an attraction in its own right and there are great restaurants and a shopping centre attached to the hotel. It's not exactly good value for money but it's great for a luxurious treat.,4,July 2018,
"Too expensive, but one night is worth the experience",maritereh,"I have to be honest: this is not a luxury property though price per night might make you think it is. So, I you expect the best service and a good value for your money, go to the Four Seasons or the St Regis. This is a very expensive hotel and it's not exclusive at all. Maybe social media seduced you (yeah, that's how I fell for it) and you wanna try it, which is ok, but take this into consideration before booking and spending your money. That being said, I don't regret at all the night I spent here. It's very easy to get here from the airport: metro takes you to the entrance in no time. Though it's always full of people everywhere, check in and check out went really fast for me.

Overrated,Rubbertoe318,"POSITIVE The views and the location. The root-top pool.   NEGATIVE Too crowded, feels more like a shopping centre or an airport rather than a hotel. They should restrict most of the areas to guests only. If you pay a premium to stay in a luxury hotel, you expect there to be less people.  Too many restrictions, even for guests (can't use pool after check-out) The pool itself is very crowded, not very well looked-after, no clear separation from the kids area. It's a mess.  Beds are rock hard and not very comfortable Rooms are quite dated, not very modern Everything is super-expensive! $$$",3,June 2019,

OMG!,kevfromoz,"We decided to finish our trip with a 3 day stopover  in Singapore and do it in style. We were not disappointed. If this place isn’t on your bucket list it should be. Everything was a jaw dropping eye opener. The rooms were phenomenal, the staff the most friendly and helpful ever.  Then there’s the place itself. As per the title of my review OMG! Restaurants, bars, that 57th floor infinity pool.... it goes on forever. We’re definitely coming back here",5,June 2019,
Marina Suites,QUEENBEE G,"We stayed here at the Marina Suites on October of 2013, travelling with family and friends came to visit! Stayed for 3 nights 4 days Our Suite is one of only 9 suites on Tower 1 and we have our own elevator! How posh is that?’  It’s armed with double doors, gym, spa, 3 viewing decks, TWG coffee and teas huge dining area and receiving area! We enjoyed so much! I returned with friends in 2016 and 2017!  It’s a Sands Life!!!",5,July 2018,
Must do,Maurice W,"We booked the Marina Bay Sands for the last 2 days we were in Singapore and I must say how impressed we were with this hotel, having been to Singapore 8 months earlier and checked out what was there, shops,food court & restaurants we decided to hang the expense and stay there  this time.  Check in was a 3pm but we arrived around 12 and they found us a room on the 25th floor as we had requested a room on the gardens buy the bay side, there are more expensive rooms on higher floor but this room was in our budget this time. All the staff are so professional with dealing with the guests and nothing is a problem, we were staying in tower 3 and what I liked was the security guard at the lift entrance checking room keys (stops non guests accessing the accommodation floors) Our room had…",5,June 2019,
The hotel of Singapore,Vinsup,"It might be a bit overpriced but it is also an experience. If you can afford it (even for a night) you should do it. At least because it gives you access to this massive Infinity Pool at the top which is also an experience to do once (even if it is very crowded even at 8.30AM) Room was great also, but I would have expected a little bit better for the price (like a real balcony). But I have to say that bathroom was gorgeous. Overall I am glad to have tried it once in my life.",5,May 2019,
Spectacular Hotel but expensive,Abha,This hotel is located at a premium location. Me and my family really enjoyed there. We stayed there for two days and I must say all the services were amazing. Rooms were well kept and breakfast buffet had plethora of food items.Must stay hotel if you are visiting Singapore.,5,October 2018,
"Nice hotel, but be careful! ",EGV,"Arrived to the hotel early, at around 9:00, but was lucky to receive the keys anyways. However, we had to pay 100 SingaporeAn dollars for an extra bed, which was a hit overpriced. Got a room at floor 41. The room was nice; big and pretty clean. However, you have to be careful about accidentally using it taking something that costs money. When ordering food, be aware that things like ketchup costs extra money. (2 Singaporean dollars for 1 small cup!!) Learnt that from experience.  ",4,June 2019,
Stunning Hotel,Blesie M.,"Had a wonderful experience staying in this hotel. My kids love the pool, view was awesome! Thank you Ms Michelle Ramos, Ms Jessica Yap and Zhang Lei for making our stay very comfortable and relaxing. Looking forward to our next staycation.. :)",5,June 2019,
It is expensive hotel but its worth staying here,fhera,"Luxury room and hotel, We choose room with balcony and face to Garden by The Bay. We can see the Night Performance of Garden The Bay from our room, with music and colorful light. You can see also big cruise ship is leaning back at port.  Trying also the infinty pool and take the picture with highrised building background from the pool.  Going to rooftop (special for Hotel Guest only), enjoy Singapore City and enjoy the bar.  10 minutes walking to Garden by The Bay. don't missed laser light and water show in front of Marina Bay Sands Mall at 7pm or 8pm (ask concierge)",5,July 2018,
Amazing,Tasten_K,"Situated in the Marina Bay area, a short walk from the downtown core, it’s a beautiful, quiet oasis unto itself. The views are spectacular and we love the hotel’s design. The pool is beautiful, the Observation deck amazing and the service blow your mind. Staff is very kind and helpful. In my opinion one of the best hotel in Singapore.",5,March 2019,
Simply amazing and worth staying,Manoj Vapi,I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights its expensive but believe me its worth staying whenever visiting singapore try to stay at least one night in this hotel. So neat and clean ly maintain there is swimming pool named infinity pool at 52floor only in the world family.Ther is metrotrain running below this hotel and dher is also casino .Breakfast we get choice to select from 3 hotels .Everything perfect will definately stay here in my next visit,5,November 2018,
A Landmark but over rated,Atnicko,"We have just spent 3 nights at Marina Bay Sands. It’s like a city within a city. People people people. Rude people, ignorant people, some courteous people, and a few smiles from staff. The rooms are OK. The bed is hard! Bathrooms are clean and well stocked.  The internet in the room and hotel is woeful!! Constantly drops out. The top deck pool is unique and easy to get a lounge. Just beware the photographer in the pool......they want from S$140 up...... The food in the restaurants is quite good, coffee is excessively expensive and drinks are even worse.  Forget about the Sands Rewards as it is a pain in the arse to register and then they want your passport to pick up the card!!!",3,June 2019,
Bucket list,Floyd2013,"Spent 3 nights here in March 2019 on route to Perth. Being an F1 fan and seeing this place during the race coverage, it was added to my bucket list of places to visit and to have a plunge in the infinity pool. I was not disappointed and hope to return for the Singapore Gran Prix sometime soon 😊",5,March 2019,
luxury hotel with views and a pool (an extraordinary one),Jussi R,"Stayed here with family in June, and had a nice stay. The hotel is large, consisting of three towers with over 40 floors in each, so the number of guests is very high. Most of the facilities have been designed for these numbers, so things worked mostly OK. This is a nice luxury hotel, but most of the (very high) price of stay is for the infinity polls on the roof of the hotel, and the views to Singapore and views/access to the Marina Bay gardens. For those things one could pay that money (once), but for other (or longer) stays there are better luxury options in Singapore, and for (far?) less money. Rooms higher up are more expensive, and rooms lower are less expensive. Rooms are nice and modern, with the kind of decoration and facilities you would expect from a 5-star hotel (see…",3,June 2019,
Amazing Hotel with roof top swimming pool only in world,Goyal Manoj,Beautiful Hotel with excellent services.Stayed for 4 nights enjoyed every bit. Highlight was swimming pool at roof top called infinity pool very clean water with amazing view. Expensive but worth staying at least one night,5,November 2018,
Worth a visit,CindersS25,"Our Group of 7 paid a visit to the bar at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The view is undoubtedly spectacular! Although each ticket holder was given $20 to spend at the bar, after purchasing 3 cocktails, 1 whiskey and 3 bowls of fries. We were still out of pocket $70! You can view the pool from the bar and be tantalised by the fact you can’t enter. We did not pay extra for the viewing platform and am not unhappy we didn’t! I’m not sure the view is that much better?! Definitely worth a visit!! Grab a drink and soak up the scenery, you’ll feel like you’re on top of the world!",5,June 2019,
Expensive staycation,Hongster Lim,"For the best that singapore hotel can offer, it does live up to its standard. Its got great view and big space, view is amazing however, they restrict your entry for infinity pool for not more than what amount of access cards you hold. With it being this expensive to live here and limitation to accessibility. i think its not very worth unless your budget is high.",4,June 2019,
Good but a long way off for the world's elite,J W,"I stayed at the hotel recently. The rooms were nice a big however our bags were delivered to the room late, someone came in the room to check if the mini bar was stocked instead of doing this prior to our arrival and there were a few finishing issues particularly with the hotel guest internet service not working and the air con controls in the room not responding...not to mention the check in being inefficient. It's a good hotel don't get me wrong but it is a long way off for being classed as an elite hotel of the world, especially for the money you pay...worth it for the swimming pool....but not as good as say the mirage in  vegas....as a second quick note, the restaurant CE la vie is not worth it. Very over priced, food and service isn't great. We were given the table next to…",3,June 2019,
Excellent place but it comes at a price,Kalle,"I guess everything has been said in the earlier reviews already. The hotel is located a bit outside the actual ""hotspot"" in Singapore (but all the shopping destinations etc. are still within walking distance), but the hotel itself is full of all kinds of experiences, the world-famous infinity pool being the highlight for us. The rooms were flawless in all regards.  The staff really goes the extra mile to make sure that you as a customer are happy. We even got a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room and a nice chocolate cake served in our room since we had an anniversary.  This isn't the most budget-friendly accomodation in Singapore, but as a once-in-a-lifetime experience it was really great. We were staying for just one night when travelling from Batam (Indonesia) to Johor…",4,June 2019,
Larger than life hotel,Luke P,"In previous visits to Singapore I’ve always considered staying at the Marina Bay Sands, now that I finally pulled the trigger on it I’m so glad that I did. Everything about it is luxury, and it’s proximity to the Gardens by the Bay is just the cherry on top.",5,June 2019,
Always a Nice experience.,Limu M,It was my 4th time staying at MBS and I always enjoyed it. I always request high floor 11th floor up facing the gardens. This time my family got room 3116. When you are going to the infinity pool make sure to catch sunrise and sunset (wait for the buildings to open their lights up). The pool gets crowded at peak hours like 5-8pm so i advise to go early. Free towels are provided and you can bring it back to your rooms.  There’s a free observation deck visit on your stay so make sure to use them. There’s a pamphlet that they will give during the check in explore everything on it for free. There are lots of restaurants to choose from within the hotel and nearby.  There’s an Express check out and it saves your time! A deposit fee of S$200 is required upon check in on top if your…,4,June 2019,
Worth a visit!,Alvin M,"Very good service and friendly staff,, we been assisted all the things we been asked for. The infinity pool was stunning with a great view and relaxing ambiance. Definitely coming back if we had a chance.",5,May 2019,
Definitely Worth Every Penny!,Mr. Navarro,"The hotel itself is a destination! The breath taking view of the Singapore skyline from the infinity pool is unparalleled. The staff were so courteous and helpful. After a tiring day going around SG, it’s very comforting to know that you will be going to a great hotel which is kept spotless by our daily room attendant Lei Chin. And what’s more, I didn’t even mentioned to them that it was my wife’s birthday as the room was under my name. They knew it possibly thru the passport they scanned when we checked-in and on her birthday, there was a complementary cake for her. The entire stay was unforgettable and staying in MBS is something I’m looking forward to again when I visit SG. ",5,May 2019,
The BEST Hotel experience in Singapura,Van Dadufalza,"If you’re looking for a luxurious, top-notch and memorable vacation is Singapore Marina Bay Sands would not disappoint your needs. Aside from the spacious room and great facilities they have very courteous, accomodating and sensitive staff to assist your needs, special thanks to Ms. Joanne Gonzaga for making sure our stay is beyond perfect and comfortable.",5,May 2019,
Incredible and ideal location,chardalisay,"BEAUTIFUL hotel with amazing staff! We were able to upgrade the room and had a killer view of the city and the bay! The room was so big and so clean. Truly impressed by every aspect of the hotel. It’s close to everything, there’s an MRT station right below you, and a food court if you don’t want to pay top notch prices. My one complaint though is the buffets. There are 3 which is awesome but I wish there were more selections. The international buffet was not what I was expecting, I was let down. I was expecting more selections like breakfast sandwiches (maybe I’m just homesick and looking for American breakfast foods). Other than my pickiness and homesickness, this is a beautiful hotel with beautiful people! I would return!  Breakdown:  1. Location: less than an hour taxi drive,…",5,June 2019,
Really Cool Property,hahabye,"This is a huge iconic property in Singapore.  Located just adjacent to Gardens by the Bay, it is an enormous complex of hotel towers and ultra high end shopping.  Absolutely worth a visit while in Singapore!",4,June 2019,
Worth a stay !!!,charleslee8581,This hotel is outstanding our flight got in late and they made the check in process seamless and we were thrilled to get room service and hit the bed quickly. We got a room with a view and it didn’t disappoint well worth spending the extra money. The hotel is huge with a casino and a luxury shopping mall attached which is very convenient.   Now let’s talk about the pool it’s a experience that’s for sure. Chairs were readily available even on the weekend and service was great overall. Lavo and spago are great spots for drinks and a quick bite.   Nightlife is also great a short walk to Marquee the best club in Singapore and Jordan Spitz is the man over there.,5,June 2019,
Outstanding experience!!,LenaJanina,We only stayed for 2 nights but it was definitely worth it! Our room was on the 32th floor and faced to the Garden. The view was impressive! The infinity pool was a great experience itself (even though there were SO many people taking pictures).,5,June 2019,
DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,Erin E,"For me, MBS is the pinnacle of any stay in Singapore. They do everything magnificently. Notwithstanding, here are some of my tips:  * TRY STAY ON A HIGHER FLOOR *  I think it's obvious why, but it really does make a difference. We upgraded from a level 2-9 floor to the 43rd floor and boy were we impressed.  * CITY VIEW MORE SPECTACULAR (imo) * My husband and I had a sea view, while my family had a city view. Imo, the city view was far more spectacular. There are just so many things to look at + you get to see the light show in the evening.  * ORDER ROOM SERVICE FOR BREAKFAST *  Because why not!? What is better than having your breakfast rolled in for you at an allotted time. Would recommend sharing a continental or full english if you're not a big eater. Plenty of food to share…",5,June 2019,
Singapore is Marina Bay Sands,Saraturbo,"i stayed for 4 nights during my business trip, and they gave me the room at the 50 floor. Rooms are very spacious even if (in my opinion) not aligned with a real 5 stars hotel. I had in-room breakfast that is quite delicious with a very on time service. It's useful to say that you pay only for the rooftop pool: this is only the reason why you should book only 1 night here in your lifetime.  I've tried all the restaurants and i can say that they are all fine, but nothing extreme excellent. Nightclub super cool for your crazy nights!",5,May 2019,
Check-list but....,Weronika L,"Why go there?  The place to add to your ""check-list"" as you visit singapore. We treated it Just like a other tourist attraction as such.  Pros Lovely views on singapore and stunning swimming pool. The breakfast in Chinese restaurant surprising and delicious  Cons ! It is So sooo BIG that I Just felt like another number to check in or another wallet to empty... You will certainly not receive personal treatment like in other 5 stars hotels... Its Just to BIG, too crowded...   They do not accept maestro card... I had to go to an atm like 10 min walk from the hotel and withdraw a large amount of money... I was really annoyed...

Once in a lifetime experience,Paul and Ollie G,"before you die do this!  Our son stayed here a couple of years ago and we added it to our list.  We decided to go slightly mad and booked a club room.  This meant we spent nothing in the whole time we were there.  Afternoon tea, club room drinks and savories in the evening and incredible breakfast.  We booked direct and had a beautiful room on the 45th floor.  Highly recommend a city view room - we always sat Garden side when we went up to the club lounge.  Staff were exceptional and very kind to us.  Lived up to our expectations and beyond.",5,June 2019,
Amazing Hotel!,Tom S,"This hotel is absolutely amazing!  But let me tell you, it's severely overpriced and overcrowded.  It's one of the crown jewels of Singapore.  Amazing architecture, amazing views and super beautiful.  The pool is by far the best part of this hotel!  Amazing views looking over this gigantic city of tall buildings.  On the 57th floor, the pool is amazing and super iconic.  With that being said, it's swarming with people and kids!  We are on our honeymoon throughout SE Asia and went from Thailand to Singapore, which was quite a shock and very different!  The Marina Bay Sands is linked to a super huge mall with tons of super high end stores like Gucci, LV, etc.  It's truly in the hustle-bustle part of town.

Everything is there-!!!!,Elze,Cocktail and appitizers with my friends at Spago. Wheter you go for the food the drinks the amazing view the hospitality or the music.... it is all there!! The best place to experience Singapore in all ways. Go just before sunset and see the city turning into a fairy of lights - overlooking the greatest infinity pool ever. If you happen to meet Glynn Tay- the manager you are even more lucky- she has the best advices on the right food to try or drinks to experience.,5,June 2019,
Amazing hotel with a ton of ambience,TravellingLimo,I stayed here with my parents and stayed in the sands suite. It wasn't cheap but you do get what you pay for! Had a direct view of the gardens like it was my backyard. My parents loved it as well. The infinity pool was very crowded but expected. Definitely received staying here at least once in your life!,5,February 2019,
This is a great hotel,Yarro,"We are hard to please and this hotel did the job. Very nice rooms, good service, attentive staff and good facilities make this a good choice for Singapore stays.   The Club55 service team were amongst the best we have met and greeted us by name every time we entered. The food in the club was good quality and varied each day.  Breakfast, light lunch and evening canapés were provided with drinks after 5pm.   The lobby of the hotel is like Bedlam - very, very, very crowded with streams of tourists yelling and taking selfies so the check-in was not very relaxing and it took a while to find the correct location. However, once through this chore and in the room the madding crowds faded and we enjoyed almost every aspect of our stay. ",5,June 2019,
Great hotel,GlobeTrotter,"My family always have  a great time at Marina Bay Sands . We stayed there during March school holidays and it was all worth it . My daughter enjoyed swimming at the huge infinity pool overlooking Singapore skyline, we hung out at the windy built in Skypark at the rooftop and had our daily exercise by walking along the nearby Gardens by the Bay,we even got the chance to shop at the MBS mall. During breakfast,we had our sumptuous buffet meal at Rise restaurant at the hotel lobby.  Actually, there's still much to do at the area, being the main tourist spot of Singapore. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends and family !",4,March 2019,

We got upgraded to a very nice view of Gardens by the Bay. The room itself was spectacular! Smells really good and is very clean and comfortable, you could even just stay in your room! The technology inside was also very efficient. We were given a complimentary cake as we were celebrating my sister's birthday.

Roof top bar and view,subenbran,"I recently visited the roof top bar and restaurant. I must say that it is worth the visit, the view from the top is breathtaking.

lovely hotel,lima k,"pros: good location the mrt is just right below the hotel.  helpful staff fast checkin and checkout.  lovely stores just below, and all around the hotel, cab is easily fetched too. pool was superb with great view , they even have kid zone and jacuzzi. but be warned that its very crowded and sunny its crazily packed. cons: noise isolation isn't done well, you can hear the restaurants sounds from your room with doors closed shut clearly.  i did not make phone call except to concierge but they tried to charge me, also i put some aloe vera in the fridge, without taking or eating any food or drinks but they tried to charge me claiming even if i didn't consume i moved their food by a abit,  luckily after spending a 'significant' amount of time, they cancelled the charges. the gym and…",4,April 2019,

Worth every dollar !!,Olivia,My partner and I and travelled to marina bay sands on our first visit to Singapore and we loved every bit of it!

Crowded but good,Luis R,"We were there for 2 days and everything was within walking distance. The hotel premises are 5 stars but its soooo crowded that it takes away from the experience. The hotel has a viewing deck for those not staying in it, many restaurants from world famous chefs, a mega mall  with high end stores, you will definitely have enough to do for a couple of days. We went there for the pool mainly which is opened to guests only. Of course the pool itself is magnificent, but I ended up going twice for less than an hour altogether. It is just that crowded. I get it, most had the same idea I did, but even though I expected for it to be crowded it was a bit more than even I imagined. I would go back however as it is so well located to everything that you want to do. The buffet is good and…",4,June 2019,

Wonderful stay at the Marina Bay Sands!,Ana B,"We booked a family suite and we were not disappointed! The room was beautifully appointed and had so much space for our family of 4.  Room service was quick and our room attendant made us delightful towel animals each day.  This is a HUGE hotel and I can see how people might feel like the personal service is missing. But we did not have any issues. Check in and check out were easy. The concierge was very helpful in booking transportation to Sentosa for us. The restaurants are expensive, yes, but there are other places to eat in the city if it's too much for you. The location is ideal and the architecture is awe-inspiring. Thank you for a lovely stay,",5,June 2019,
Awesome splurge,Kelvin Warkentin,"This was a one-night anniversary splurge for us and we were glad we did it. It was a one-of-a-kind experience having a gorgeous view of the gardens and ocean from your balcony, and then soaking in an infinity pool at night, high above a beautiful city. You definitely pay a premium for the uniqueness of this hotel, but it was a fun stay and we have no regrets.   Like other reviewers have already said, it's more like a Vegas resort in terms of the busyness, the mall and casino, the many restaurants, and the proximity to touristy things to do. But if you're only staying one or two nights, all that is a good thing because you don't have to go anywhere else. The mall and the gardens are attached to the hotel so it's super easy to get around and never need transportation. We actually…",5,May 2019,
must stay!,Kelsey B,"My husband and I went to check in at 11 (even though it’s not until 3) with hopes of just leaving our bags there while we visited the gardens. We waited for 5 minutes in the check in line before being taken to a counter (which was fast since it takes at least 10 minutes for each person to check in). The women checking us in was able to get us checked in right then at 11. She also provided us with some water and made our dinner reservations for that night (in the hotel). The room was clean and spacious. We did have an issue with our TV not going off.

Great place but....,Lu1gi,"This is my second stay at Marina Bay. There are many things to like about this place. If you are here for a couple of nights there is no reason to leave the premises. There are many many restaurants and bars, all with different themes throughout the resort. The rooms are very spacious with great views, the staff are without exception just great. The prices can be mind boggling but you are given the menu and you make your choice. Cheaper dining can be found in Chinatown. I stopped here for 2 nights to break a trip from the UK. I imagined relaxing by the amazing pool with its infinity views. The reality was:a lot different. The pool area was unbelievably and uncomfortably overcrowded. Even the pool was crowded. Just too many people in there at one time. But what can you do if you…",4,,
Amazing but impersonal hotel,Selinawsmith,"Staff are lovely and very friendly, architecture and views are amazing - definitely pick the City View rooms. Restaurants are miles from the hotel though so it’s not too convenient. Also they told me all guests for 15% off and other F&B discounts however none of these were applied to my stay because I choose to pay cash. The restaurants all refused to honor the discounts which is pretty poor customer service if you ask me, especially as I mainly ate in their outlets during my stay. Also note that the staff in the restaurants and tourist spots won’t tell you about the deals - you have to specifically ask otherwise you just pay full price.",3,June 2019,
Big Property With All The Shopping and Eating and Casino Action,Traveller747400,"My wife and I have stayed at this property on many occasions and unfortunately we find the hotel just too big and very crowed for us. Its an interesting property as its connected to a wonderful shopping, Casino and Entertainment complex. The property due to its design and swimming pool has become an ""Iconic Property"" and in turn one of those bucket list stays. The swimming pool has one of the best views in the world but unfortunately it gets very crowed and in turn it looses the ambiance, hence why we have never wanted to swim in the pool. Given the cheer size of the complex no doubt comes operational issues, but all in all, its an impressive complex and offers a lot of facilities in the one spot.

Luxury stay,Laura K,"We tagged on 3 days at Marina Bay Sands to end our overseas holiday and absolutely loved it. The staff couldn’t be better - everyone we came into contact with so helpful and welcoming. Our room was beautiful, and the finishes made me feel like I was relaxing at my (dream) home. The pool is busy, but there are lots of places in the rooftop garden to bunker down to sunbathe or read. The gym is sparkling clean and organised with plenty of space to workout. The adjoining bathrooms are opulent. The staff told us that 6am-9am is peak time with corporate guests, so we worked out around that. What I really loved was access to some of the great attractions. The shopping centre “The Shoppes” can be accessed via underground walkways, and the Gardens By The Bay through an elevated walkway. …",5,June 2019,
Mass tourism hotel! Not too relaxing! But room is good size & nice view,Global Traveler,"When we first checked in, we felt like in the zoo, there were too many tourists and too busy and way too many rooms, we couldn't use the hotel facilities especially the pool as it was opened to non hotel guests and we felt not exclusive and private, over crowded everywhere, we couldnt stand it. Restaurants were full and not enough staffs to take care the amount of people there.  So we will not go back!  But our room is nice and good view. That's the only good thing about this hotel for our 3 day experience there. ",3,March 2019,

Club Room,Michael,"We stayed in a city view room on the 37th floor, the views of the city especially at night time were fantastic. The rooms are very spacious and the bathroom itself was bigger than the  rooms in other hotels we have stayed in in the city!  The staff in the Club 55 lounge were excellent-highly attentive with the free flowing drinks in the evening and very friendly at other times. Food was good at breakfast, could take or leave the afternoon tea and canapés which were both buffet style and not full of amazing choices.  As a resident we were able to use the pool on the roof which is something I will remember for a long time- great experience which made the stay worthwhile.   Would highly reccomend. ",5,June 2019,
Pool makes it worth it,J_coto,Have to stay at least one night if visiting Singapore. Staff was exceptionally friendly. Our room was ready for an early check-in without extra charge (around 8-9am!).

60th birthday celebration,Wendy Mascall,"2 nights to finish off a wonderful 60th birthday celebration with family and friends after being in the Maldives, we had the pleasure of being greeted by Sherman and shown to our rooms (there were 9 of us). It was a late arrival but Sherman made it seamless and efficient. Thank you Sherman, nothing was too much and we had a wonderful time and seat at Marina Bay Sands.",5,April 2019,
Disappointed Stay,World Ventures ST,"We have visited the hotel during weekend, arrived with no one assisted the luggage’s and no self park carpark in hotel. Long que upon check in and asking for add on breakfast and staff just not entertain and ask go restaurant pay next morning. Nice view ( pay for it ) but AC and hot water not working during late night . Received call and email from hotel guest relation manager but no recovery and action taken. Believe they only focus on gambling Custermer and not normal tourist.",2,June 2019,
Best honeymoon room EVER!,dacarrr,"Upon arrival we were upgraded because we were newly weds, the room was magnificent! Everything about it was good, the Cavalli toiletries, the quality towels and bedding, the view over the Gardens by the Bay and on top of everything they knocked on our door to bring us some complimentary chocolates.... yummy We used the swimming pool on top twice, both times (early morning and late evening) the pool was packed, and that place is massive. If you wait for about 5 minutes you will manage to get a couple of sunbeds together even if at first sight it looks impossible. The view from the pool is amazing, after watching it in so many documentaries, the image on TV does not do it justice. It is an expensive hotel but try it for at least one night so that you can use the pool and you will…",5,April 2019,
Just Wow!,Kay W,"It really is all about the rooftop. It is just spectacular, the views are amazing, both by night and day, and the pool is amazing. Yes it is very busy, but it really is an experience not to be missed. The rest of the hotel is also lovely, our room was very spacious, the staff were all very friendly which I thought was good given the size of the hotel, and the restaurants downstairs were very good too. The location is also excellent for exploring Singapore on foot.",5,May 2019,
Impressive,TravellerIlford,"On approaching the Marina, it is an absolutely wonderful looking building(s) on the skyline of Singapore.  When I arrived, the receptionist was very polite and helpful. I was in the third block on the 17th floor (not one for lifts, but you have to do it if you want to go anywhere).  Walking from reception to Tower 3 thought it was very busy, its almost like a street, also think its attached to the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall.  Arriving at the room, put keycard in and the curtains opened automatically, and had a  lovely view of the river where the Lion is, which I loved as having visited that side of the river on my previous visits.  The sun was just going down over the river.  My room was spacious and the bathroom was amazing.   I wanted to have a swim in the infinity pool,…",5,May 2019,
Do it for the pool!!!,Michael S,"We stopped here for 3 nights on our way to the Maldives and it was spectacular! This hotel is definitely a 5 star behemoth with so many options for food and entertainment. It’s proximity to the gardens is a huge plus but in general, it’s so central to everything you want to see/do in Singapore. I would literally run 3 miles in the morning around the gardens and the whole bay (beautiful when the sun is rising!).  The pool is a modern wonder of the world and staying at the Marina Bay just to enjoy that is entirely acceptable. Get ready to be in a selfie stick heaven when out there though! There’s not much you can’t do at this hotel if your heart desires (Michelin star restaurants, Casino, theater, etc). We definitely will stay here any time we go to Singapore.",5,July 2018,
Bucket List!,VineetMalani,"The most oft-repeated phrase during our Singapore holiday was 'Bucket List'. Marina Bay Sands is expensive, no two ways about it. Not everyone in our group was convinced about spending even a night here, it took some considerable cajoling from me and one other friend who sided with me over this 'Bucket List' hotel. In the end, we had the entire party converted to our point of view, MBS costed King's Ransom but offered some palatial comforts too.  This isn't a hotel to relax, so even if you have the budget to stay here for a week, my advice would be not to stay for more than 2 days. The lobby is busy like an Airport terminal, teeming with people and luggage being wheeled around as guests try to figure out where to check-in and out. Add to that cafes, shops and restaurants at…",5,May 2019,
Expected experience,malli42,"This review bases on two two-nights stays at the beginning and at the end of our trip. As the first stay was during the last days of the Chinese New Year, the experience differs a bit, but not totally.  As many other reviews already said, the first impression is overwhelming. The whole architecture, the lobby, the crowd of people and everything is very, very impressive – especially after a 12h flight. So do not expect a smooth, calm lobby with individual support. As long as you not a VIP guest the entrance could be crowed. Nevertheless, the service itself, is marvellous. Each wish we sent via mail has been considered and as we wanted to have a smoking room (and we understood something wrong) the guy at the reception helped us to get everything we wanted – also in advance for the…",4,February 2019,
Nice hotel but too crowded,JT3689NJ,"We stayed at marina bay sands for 3 nights. First impression is crowded. We were told to check in at tower 3 lobby. We had a taxi dropped us off at tower 3. Once we got off, we were told to walk to tower 1 to check in because tower 3 check in is closed at 7. It was 7:05pm!   The staff at tower 1 check in was very friendly. I felt better after that. The room was nice, and the bathroom was spacious. We had a nice view of garden by the bay. We can actually watch the light show from our balcony. Nice view!  I’m not sure if we supposed to have turn down service but we never did. Another thing I’m not sure is if we supposed to get bottles of water in our room everyday. We only got it one night with 4 bottles. We never got any the other days.   We went to the pool a few times. It’s…",4,June 2019,
Every bit worth its hype,James R,"We really really wanted to stay in this hotel for at least one night while in Singapore for our honeymoon. And so we did. And it was a night well worth it! The first surprise came when we checked in. Beforehand, we told management that we were newlyweds and that we wanted to spend a special night of our honeymoon here. And Marina Bay Sands graciously accommodated us by upgrading our booking to a suite near the top floor with a wonderful view of the Gardens by the Bay. It was a rather substantial upgrade too since we originally booked the cheapest room which was at the lower floors overlooking traffic LOL. So there, in the first few minutes of walking through their magnificent hotel, we were already forming positive impressions of the place. They even sent us a tray of local…",5,May 2019,
Best stay,Mitchell,"I was very pleased to stay here on business with my colleagues. I stayed at one of the premiere rooms and it was great. Very bright feel to it and I had a city view so it was lovely. My stay had an access to the Skypark so that was fantastic. The room itself had everything I needed to do my work like free WiFi, work desk, and mini bar. I had a very peaceful sleep for 3 nights and hope to be back soon.",5,December 2018,
Holiday memories of a lifetime,julieacau,"Totally blown away with just how amazing our stay with MBS was. We had booked two rooms being a family of 4 all adults, on arrival they upgraded us to a suite. We were overwhelmed with the MBS generosity and just how fantastic the suite was- who has a grand piano in their room? Wow! The excitement we all felt walking into the suite will forever be a treasured memory. Then the curtain fell down, and they swiftly upgraded us again to another suite, even though it was almost impossible to imagine a better room, it was. Room service: food was well presented and delivered on hot plates. They set the table with cloth serviettes, personalized condiments and a glass of chilled water.",5,June 2019,
worth a night or two for the experience!,Sarah A,"The views are great; the sky-pool is wonderful and the location can't be beat. The service however is average and the rooms, while nice, are not anything special if you go for the standard. It is worth staying one or two nights at the most for use of the top 'deck' and sky-pool, but look somewhere else for better value for money if your trip is longer.",4,June 2019,
Pinnacle of Luxury,Andie,"Every stay comes with an amazing experience. First time had a garden view and it was magnificent. The second time had a city view which was majestic especially at night. The room interiors were commendable....but really love the bathroom and bathtub cuz spacious. Let's face it, the infinity pool was the main reason people book this hotel, which gives you incredible backdrop for a perfect snapshot. Tip: go to the pool as early as you can to avoid pack of crowd😱. The staff were very accommodating and helpful.",5,December 2018,
Visit to Sands Hotel,Nellieluk,"The Sands Hotel with the longest roof top swimming pool is the new icon of Singapore. There are three towers in the hotel . We walked in the lobby and found a lot of people walking around. The Hotel is attached to a casino with many entrances, it is also connected to a big shopping mall with exclusive boutiques, restaurants and food court.",4,June 2019,
Poor Hotel,rd093,Extremely disappointed with the service here. We asked for our room to be made up 5 times. They finally came at 5.30 pm !!!!!!!!! Imagine how you would feel if you spent almost £400 per night here and the service was awful. The hotel was extremely busy and generally too big. The views were amazing and that's the reason for the 2 star and not 1 star. After 5 minutes the novelty of the scenery wares off and you realise it's a big waste of money and there are plenty of other hotels which will be half the price and 10 times better.,2,June 2019,
Marina Bay Sands Hotel Stay,maheshrathod,"We booked Marina Bay Sands Hotel for one night stay for 15 people Family - 5 rooms city view rooms on 45 floor.

Marina Bay Sands Hotel Singapore,Gregory S,Not cheap but you get what you pay for. Recommend a city view room over a sea view room. Worth paying that bit more for a higher level room. Views were magnificent. The top level bar and pool views were magical. Bring your camera and enjoy. Room was very nice too.,5,May 2019,
Most amazing hotel in the world,Marverlouspie,"Our stay here was just perfect, everything you would expect when paying 5* prices.  If your looking for the prefect view, service, facilities, and surroundings this is the place for you.  Everything was perfect  Regards  Juli & Brian",5,May 2019,
It’s an Experience,haylz_me,"Stayed here for 2 nights to see what all the fuss is about. It’s an experience, that’s for sure! From the lines to check in, to the casino downstairs (with a drink station robot!), to the rooftop pool and sunrise yoga (extremely beginner and boring unfortunately), to the multiple options for restaurants (some extremely good; others extremely rude and not worth the time or money), to the gym and its amazing view, to the rooms.... we stayed on the 45th floor. The view was amazing. The room and bed was great. The bathroom was large and spacious but the designers forgot one important thing - a power point in the bathroom for the hairdryer. Upon querying how I was to blow dry my hair, I was provided a super long extension cord. Bit odd and disappointing for such an extravagant…",4,January 2019,
Spectacular and worth a visit,KJ1711,"We stayed at MBS for two nights. We wanted to see what all the hype was all about and it didn’t disappoint us. The service is amazing, the architecture is stunning and running of the hotel is smooth and really impressive. Yes it is expensive (particularly the buffet in one of the restaurants) but then Singapore generally is one of the most expensive places I’ve ever been so it was to be expected. The room we had was huge and the view over the city was really gorgeous. Easy to get lost in the hotel as there are the three towers and all sorts of different lifts you can end up in completely the wrong place! The rooftop pool was obviously very cool and wasn’t as busy as I had been led to believe by previous reviews. I think since they no longer let non-guests up to the pool it’s…",5,June 2019,
"Great place to visit, but pricey",sueg719,"The shopping mall is good and it's a great place to look at, but the rooftop, the gardens and the accommodation are all very expensive.  It would be worth seeing at night when everything is lit up.  Also worth visiting when the fireworks are on.",4,May 2019,
"If in Singapore, you've got to try it! Amazing experience.",datraveller1,"Almost put off staying here by some reviews re long check ins, too busy pool, bad service- but we found it all untrue.  Everything was amazing, easy and smooth.  The pool does not seem overpacked at all (May) and it has an adult only section too which was great.  Stayed in a club room- so club lounge access was well worth it.  Amazing experience all round! Would love to go back!",5,May 2019,
Great location excellent service nice view,Champa,"My first stay here due to exhibition at its expo Centre. Service is good, reception and concierge are very helpful. Airport pickup is super efficient, hotel rep was waiting for me at the sky bridge when I was off the plane, and really helpful to move my 3 large suitcases from luggage claim to the car. Sorry can’t remember his name, he picked me up around 8.30pm on 26 May.   Love the food in Blossom Chinese Restaurant, especially the soups, delicious and very healthy ingredients. Dined there every day during my entire stay, fantastic service, especially supervisor Tommy Tan, attention to details and remembers all my habits, likes and dislikes. Very helpful and professional. Highly recommended   Thank you Tommy",5,June 2019,
Fun,Nadia M,"One of the best review we red about this hotel before staying there was ""there is nothing relaxing about the Marina Bay Sands, and it has the feeling of organised chaos"". This really helped in terms of our expectations! The hotel is brilliant, fun, busy. Expect crowds and queues, but it is worth it.",5,November 2018,
Outstanding location to convention center and very good for such a large hotel,pjltang,"Expectations of service in such a large hotel are not as high as smaller more luxurious properties.  However, this hotel's service has improved over the past year.  Was here for business and found the hotel full of tourists.  Yet, requests were all met quickly and efficiently.  Will definitely stay again for the convenient location and the fact that the staff actually seems to enjoy what they are doing.  ",4,May 2019,
Delightful stay,Sheena A,"On arrival greeted with a smile and icecream. We were then upgraded to a room with a view of the Gardens By The Bay. Great facilities, comfortable beds and great service. Lots of places to choose to eat at including the breakfast buffets in the morning.",5,May 2019,
This is a must when you’re here.,Gordon Murray,This is the best view of Singapore you’re gonna get. 23 sg dollars to the top. The only disappointment is you can’t get a glass of champagne at the top. But you can buy a Singapore Sling. It’s cheaper than a beer. Wonderful,5,June 2019,
A Great Way To Celebrate,Bobrp17,"My wife and I decide to lash out for our 40th Wedding Anniversary and decided to book 3 nights at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Our room was on the 45th floor overlooking one of the inner waterways. On walking into the room we spotted an elephant made from a hand towel. Each morning the room service attended put another one on the bed. We didn't have the heart to break them up as they looked pretty awesome and good on the end of the bed.  The view is spectacular. In the evening we opened up the curtains and watched the water and laser show. It was amazing to be able to sit in the room enjoying a wine or two watching the show, just chatting away and relaxing. The restaurants were quite amazing and the food was very nice. We paid a bit extra for our room so we were able to take…",5,October 2018,
One of the most beautiful sightseeing in Singapore,Aging13,"We spent a day in marina Bay, we even did'nt get much time to check all the places but this spectacular facade has been very memorable .  It has laser lights at night .  You will see it if you eat dinner near the Bay . A lot of family spend their time at the park and some are busy with the e bike and E scooter activity . it was worth the visit and we were able to spend much time taking pictures and we will definitely be back and check it out on our next visit to Singapore",5,October 2018,
Stop over in Singapore,Mar_Noriega,"The hotel is quite impresive, the observation deck on level 57 has an amazing view of the city and the gardens. The flowers light up at 7:45 and 8:45 si watch out for that. From the hotel it is only a 10 min walk to the Gardens. You get complimentary laundry service (one per day)! Access to Club 55 is not as exclusive as we thought, so there are long waiting periods at peak hours, however you get free drinks and snacks!!! The zero edge pool on level 56 is quite nice, however it feels too crowded and it is very busy at all times. Nice complimentary breakfast at any of the three restaurants, it is a very generous buffet service.",5,May 2019,
Breath taking views,Kamran20,"We visited the bar on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Although it’s not cheap, the views alone make the money spent well worth it.  The views are extraordinary and the music is just right.  The whole experience is one to remember.  We’ll definitely go again.",5,May 2019,
Excellent location,Becky E,"Very busy hotel in a brilliant location. Rooms very comfortable, we had a lovely view of the harbour. The pool is very nice although very busy.

Interesting and Exotic Hotel,Kahaluu_Bob,"This is a beautiful, large hotel. If you are reading about it, you already know how unique its architecture is. We splurged a bit for a larger room on an upper floor, looking out over the city. It was beautiful at night and during the day! I think the harbor view would have been interesting during the day, but perhaps less so at night. We took advantage of the large shopping center that is part of the complex on a daily basis. The infinity pool on the top floor of the hotel is a major draw. Some days it was quite crowded, other days almost empty. I have no idea why, except to guess that the hotel had large conferences some days and not others. The quality of the hotel and the service of its employees was top notch, I think, and the location -- close to many of Singapore's best…",5,May 2019,

An Amazing Hotel,Alnoor Kara,My family and I stayed here for a few days and had an amazing time. It wasn’t my parents first time here and they were extremely satisfied from their first visit. The private check in for suites was great and very efficient. Club 55 is great for breakfast and to go to before heading out for dinner. Our room was great and had the perfect view of the city and nightly light show. The pool of course is the highlight. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to have an amazing stay in Singapore.,5,April 2019,
Marina Bay visit,Kumar,"The view is amazing. However, the charges are slightly higher for a elevator ride. The charges may be optimized and some restaurants should be set up to offer vegetarian food.

"Overpriced, overrated but you should still visit once!",JasonInSG,"I think everyone should stay here once. Tick it off the bucket list then book into a better hotel in Singapore, of which there are many! The design of this building is spectacular with its 3 iconic towers and rooftop pool, however make no mistake, it is far from exclusive!  The rooms are quiet, spacious and well equipped. It’s easy to forget there are over 2500 rooms here until you venture out of the door. Admittedly we stayed here the night before a public holiday, but there are even queues for the lifts to get to your room!  A trip to the pool is an adventure. After you’ve used your card to gain access to the pool deck you can enjoying sharing the view with 200-300 other guests!

Best hotel ever.,767captlarry,"My adult son and I stayed there for 3 nights a few weeks ago. I cannot say enough on how much we enjoyed ourselves. We had a room with a city view on around the 25th floor, not sure exactly.  The room was huge with a large bathroom.  All the whistles and bells. The staff was superb. We couldn't ask for more. And the rooftop pool,  unbelievable.  Since we've seen enough of Sing, we will spend all our time at the pool on our next visit. A little pricey but you've got to try it at least once.  I cannot wait to stay there again. Thank you Marina Bay for the time of our life.",5,May 2019,
One of the best,Kenny,"You can never go wrong with MBS, its in a convenient location and probably the best hotel outside of Sentosa.

Seen it now..,Jammy1983,"I picked this hotel because this is the place to stay in Singapore. It's an icon of Singapore. My room was on a high floor overlooking the city. The view from the room is great, and the skydeck actually gives you almost the same view from the room, except   for the other side, the Gardens by the Bay which I couldn't see from my room. The infinity pool seemed too crowded with people who are worrying if they could get the perfect selfie or not. Check-in and check-out were done great, didn't have to wait long. One of the hosts on the skydeck wasn't too kind, i paid over 500 singapore dollar to stay 1 night in your hotel, be kind to your guests. Now i've seen it, i know it's all about the view. Instead of staying there, a visit to the skydeck is sufficient.",3,June 2019,

Best choice in Singapore.,jetsilver1,I had read a few unfavourable reviews that almost made me change my mind about staying here. So happy we went ahead and stayed 9 nights! Amazing service right from check in through to check out! We travelled with our one year old baby and they provided everything we needed in the room (including things we didn't ask for but were so helpful). Yes it's busy in the foyer and public areas but not to the point where we needed to wait for lifts or to speak to a staff member. There are countless restaurants to choose from and even the high end options accommodate children. The room was spacious even with a cot and the view out to Gardens by the Bay was lovely.

A Must Stay for Any Visit to Singapore,Jack V,"We stayed here last year on our way over to Europe and this place blew me away. We received an upgrade to a room with a view of the harbour and the city which was very much appreciated. The room itself was beautifully fitted out, reminded me of the Encore Las Vegas in many ways.  The highlight for us though was the rooftop bar, the view from the top is incredible and the cocktail list was superb, I think we had one of everything on the menu by the end of the night. Glynn the bar manager went above and beyond, couldn't have done any more to make us feel welcome. The food offering was also 11/10, the pork belly may have been the greatest bite I've experienced in my life.  If you have the opportunity to stay, do not hesitate. Pull the trigger and book!",5,July 2018,
Slightly disappointed,134TraceyJ,"I stayed here for 2 nights after everyone telling me this was the place to stay in Singapore. On entrance it felt like an airport, large and extremely busy.

We went to the pool but that was not a pleasant experience very busy with children and guests taking selfies! We had a very tasty meal at the Italian restaurant on the roof with delicious cocktails but that came at a price! You pay for the view. The most disappointing part of the stay was at check out when we asked could we spend the day by the pool as we had a late flight we were refused!

To start with, coming here expecting this will be a boutique hotel experience with very few people in the facilities and the pool is total nonsense...yes there will be people all the time at the pool, in the observation deck, in the hotel, in the elevator but that is what MBS is so being disappointed by that does not make any sense.  We booked for 2 nights in a club room with skyline (city) view which is absolutely the sweet spot for value and price you can find! If you have the means to do it, it should be a no brainer! we checked…",5,April 2019,
"Extravagant comfort and luxury, but lacking character on the inside.",Stu’s Reviews Travel,"Dont get me wrong, this hotel is a beautiful piece of art from the outside. Its an absolutely stunning piece of architecture, that dwarfs much of the Singapore skyline. On the inside, its clean and magnificent too - however I did find it lacking character in the rooms.  Everything was very 'safe' and very 'beige', nothing that stood out. The room was comfortable and clean, and the bed softer than a million feathers, but it really was just too safe. I would've liked a slightly more dazzling room for the price! One thing that I didn't expect was the pool up top to be as clean as it was. I had heard horror stories about this pool, but actually I was pleasantly surprised with its cleanliness all things considered. Overal, the MBS is a 'safe' bet if your looking for something…",4,May 2019,
Bucket list TICK,Boultis,I first saw this hotel several years ago when watching the F1 GP in Singapore and since then I have been dieing to stay there.  Had the chance this year for a night before a cruise.  Everything I hoped for was satisified from the excellent check in service to the infinity pool on the roof.  You have to see the pool to believe me as words cannot describe the view from the pool.  We stayed in a club room and recomend spending the extra for this.  You get to stay on a high floor with express lifts.  You get a priority check in (although we forgot this).  You have access to a club room on the top floor with snacks and drinks and breakfast is also included in the restaurant on the 55th floor again with amazing views.  Rooms have everything you need and are quite large.  We stayed on…,5,March 2019,
5* until we were charged twice.,B10326,Everything had been great until we checked our bank statements and realised we had been charged twice.   On arrival my partner used his credit card to pay to be told it had been declined. We had been travelling and we were hot and bothered so didn't think to check it had been declined on the reader or ask for a receipt.   I then paid on my card.  Checked our statements to notice both cards had been charged.   I emailed them and to be fair to them they did reply within 24 hours and said they would credit my account.   What I found disgusting was that I spoke with 3 different people and not once did I receive an apology for their mistake. Now I have to wait a minimum of 15 days for £364 to be returned to me.   I think the least I deserve is an apology. Terrible service. Anybody…,2,May 2019,
Stay here for sure !!!,Gift_Gift_Gift,This was my second time here and I can not be grateful enough to the staff for the lovely suite given to us. I travelled here with my mom and brother and its was their first time and the MBS staff made sure ti make it a memorable one !!! Loved the pool and the room views !!! The rooms were big and super clean...the staff is kind and prompt !!! This is a must stay at hotel !!! it is an amazing experience !!! cant wait to visit again !!!,5,March 2019,
Nice vacations,Ekaterina G,Clean and modern room on the 36 floor . Breakfast has not been included but there many eateries around . I liked city view from the pool . But what I really didn’t like it was a pool water . So many people I understand but too many discharge in the pool water . For me it’s disgusting. I think it’s because guests are not taking a shower before entering.,4,May 2019,
A hotel .... or a tourist attraction ? ...,chiefy134,"Unquestionably a bit of both. The MBS is known the world over and has become something of a box ticking destination. Well now I have ticked that box and satisfied my curiosity I highly doubt I will return. The rooms were OK, and of course the views are spectacular. But is it really one of the world's best hotels (as a recent BBC documentary claimed) - not in my book. Despite an advance reservation asking for 2 rooms close by, we were allocated one on 33 and another on 36. No big deal right ? Well it is when the lifts serve either 0-34 or 34-57. Luckily our kids are old enough for it not to be such an issue, but nonetheless a little daft from the front desk. The pool area is of course another box ticker - but again it's not faultless. Whilst the introduction of resident only use…",4,May 2019,
Spectacular holiday!!,Squasheee,"Marina Bay Sands is the most amazing place I have ever stayed in. Service is excellent - all staff were very friendly, always greeting you and would do anything to help. The infinity pool was spectacular! It is open long hours and is always very busy, but the pool makes the whole visit worthwhile. Breakfast was definitely worthwhile - massive range of food and they would even cook certain meals on request, plus baristas would make coffee to order. Rooms were beautiful - great beds and the bath was very romantic. We also had spectacular views of the gardens across the road and the light shows at night...  The hotel is right next to the train station and a shopping centre.  We are already planning and saving for our next visit...",5,May 2019,
Skypark is amazing and THE reason to stay here,The Travel Pro,"- Skypark is truly amazing and such a relaxing place to be with beautiful views! Rooms are nice, but for 400 euro a night you might expect more. Very nice it was possible to make use of the shower facilities in the evening after check out   · Lobby and entree is a very busy and not only restricted to hotel guests, but there are loads of non guest tourists, conference / business men, casino visitors etc. It gives the feeling this is a multipurpose building which accidentally also has hotel rooms to offer. We got the feeling they have a lot of free-runners, so there are highly keen on keeping deposit on your credit card (200 SGD standard), multiple times check these, ask for evy transaction your cards in the hotel bars, restaurant, pool an block you access to your room once you…",3,May 2019,
Absolutely Amazing!!,Alexandra,"The staff was friendly/attentive from the minute we checked in until we checked out. The rooms are very spacious and clean. We had a view of the Gardens by The Bay, which was absolutely stunning. We (like most hotel guests) enjoyed the afternoon/next morning at the pool, which can get pretty crowded. The drinks were a little expensive, but to be expected from such a staple hotel in Singapore. The views of the city are amazing and the staff are very friendly, making sure you have what you need.

"Excellent Resort, heart warming service",Nishan84,"Stayed in MBS this last week with my wife as a part of her week-long birthday treat amd was amazed by everything/everyone we encountered. Booked  this resort primarily for the use of the infinity rooftop swimming pool but was blown away by the hospitality of the entire staffs from Security to Front Office to Housekeeping to the Manager. So thoughtfull and engaging and passionate to make the guests stay wonderful and memorable.. Will definitely be back soon, for the heart warming service this time!! Special mention to “Kaura” at FO, “Xie Mei” at Housekeeping and Ms Nicole !!!! We appreciate all of you for making our trip unforgettable!!! 🙏",5,May 2019,
Perfect,Ben F,"Location sensational, hotel stunning with room on 34th floor overlooking city plus a bathroom (tub) view overlooking Gardens by the Bay.  Rooms are well appointed and large,  very good.  Access to shops and surrounding attractions excellent with MRT on site.  Roof top access to unbelievable pool just a stunning experience, exclusive to residents.",5,May 2019,
One of the best,Lucy P,"MBS was fantastic, stayed 3 nights and probably only saw half of the hotel! Had a room looking onto the gardens- beautiful, the room was very big and bathroom also spacious with walk-in shower. I wasn’t feeling too well upon my first day so ordered room service probably the best I had ever had.  The rooftop infinity pool is great, good bar and restaurant also with plenty of options to suit all. Staff and service were great and efficient I will be back!!",5,March 2019,
It’s an experience,CCW1987,"So it’s definitely not a five star hotel, but worth staying there for the famous rooftop - though I will say the rooftop is a little underwhelming. It’s incredibly overcrowded all hours of the day.   Presumably in an effort to only allow hotel guests on the roof you have to use your hotel key to enter and exit the rooftop, which is fine - but they also have manned key in/key out turnstiles like every 50 feet as you walk the length of the roof - it’s a little much.   The breakfast and afternoon tea are lovely and overall we had good service. ",3,May 2019,
Avoid hotel - rip off,Thomas F,"The marina bay sands leverages their architecture and famous infinity pool to get you. And you get those things but nothing else. Its easily the worst service I have ever gotten in a luxury hotel. There are so many guests no one cares if you have a complaint, you are just a number. I had many firsts in this hotel: consistently waiting for 20min to receive a drink because of the number of guests, I was not allowed to leave the bar until they checked my room number and name (implying that I am lying) and as a final screw you, u are not allowed to use any amenities after your check out. If ur plane is in the evening, they dont care u cant use the pool or anything else. When I complained about it the concierge told me I am allowed to store baggage after checkout. Like this would be…",1,May 2019,
Most amazing views from infinity pool,Luyanda N,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. They have first-class service and their rooms had amazing views of the gardens by the bay. We absolutely loved everything about this place, especially the infinity pool. You can't leave Singapore and not stay at least 1 night here",5,April 2019,
Thanksgiving in Singapore,MomEsq19,"The rooftop pool was the reason we stayed at MBS. Was it worth it? Totally - yes. High floor room facing harbor allows for view of light show at night.   Would I stay again? Highly likely. It’s all about the pool, being able to shop at nearly every brand store nearby, and walkable to massive gardens. ",4,November 2018,
Birthday week spoil of luxury,megendrie c,"My husband surprised me for my birthday after watching the movie, Crazy Rich Asians. This hotel is amazing, feels like Christmas 24/7. It is 5 star luxury so don't expect any bargains, discounts etc. You have to pay premium from the coffee to cocktails. Really nice club upstairs, easy entrance to mall and gardens. Our room was so spacious, clean and comfortable. I later stayed at the Westin after coming back from Bintan Island. If you want opulence and premium prices, book here otherwise try the Westin for reasonable priced 4-5star. Would we come back, definitely!!!",5,April 2019,
best Shrimp,Shirley H,We had the best meal ever at the Marina Bay Sands - loved the whole meal and view. I would say the shrimp cocktail was the best ever! Highly recommend going here if you can. We took the subway and found the trip wonderful. If your able to sit outside it's even better for the view and the breeze,5,January 2019,
Very busy hotel.,DeborahSeventyOne,"I wanted to stay at this hotel and finally got my way in March 2019.     I have done it now, been there and done it.   I would not want to rush back.   The hotel is unique and interesting but it was so busy.  I could not walk through reception in a straight line without walking into the masses, every morning breakfast was like queuing in a staff canteen, the lifts were slow and packed with people and the pool area overflowing with people.   Like I say, should I return to Singapore I would not return to this hotel.   There was only one lady at check-in/concierge who was very helpful and acknowledged us - possibly called Anna - she was a supervisor - otherwise the hotel is too big to offer a personal service.",3,March 2019,
Vegas in Singapore,We are A,"I will be honest to start with. Most likely a one off experience for me. Was too big and felt a lot like a Vegas or Macau casino resort. Lots of people (staff included), casino, high end shops, indoor waterfall and canal (fancy a boat ride?), not hard to lose your way. But heck its worth the experience. You pay the high price for the amazing infinity pool and view (forget doing laps - way too crowded!). Beware: don't forget your room pass or you may get hassled by security as I was. Other pluses... the food court is large and has quite a bit to choose from. And garden at the Bay is next door. Our garden view room had a view of the garden and man made structures. Colorful lights at night but noisy traffic below 24/7.  Don't worry its too hot to stay outside on the balcony for too…",4,April 2019,
A Superb Experience,Toje7162,"We decided to stay in Marina Bay Sands after a hiatus of 4 years following a bad experience. So glad we decided to give it another go!   We stayed in the Orchid Suite with Harbour/Garden view. As we had the suite, check in is done at a separate check in area. The whole process flowed and took minimal time. We were in our suite within 15 mins.   The room is massive! It had its own lounge room/sitting area. Separate dressing room. A spacious, luxurious bathroom supplied with upmarket amenities. The views were breathtaking as we were on the 53rd floor in Tower 3. The housekeeping team kept our room immaculately clean. The turn down service was a welcome relief when we returned to our room after exploring Singapore at night.  The room comes with Club access which includes breakfast,…",5,May 2019,

Splurge.  You'll be glad you did.,Mike C,"There was no question at all when deciding where to spend our last night in Singapore -- the Marina Bay Sands.  Yes, it is pricey.  Quite pricey.  The experience and memories made though are priceless.  Check-in was smooth though the employee (Sunny) who helped ended up trying to pull a fast one by telling us that our room was not ready.  She went ahead and changed us to another one that was and that had a better view -- failing to mention the hefty up charge which we noticed on our bill during checkout the following morning.  The checkout manager (Julie), however, was very professional and took care of the situation.    The room was spacious and comfortable.  The pool was every bit as amazing as many other travelers have described.  We particularly enjoyed watching the night…",5,March 2019,
Just fantastic,lalyas,Stayed at this hotel for couple of days and could not fault it. The check in was smooth and efficient.  Staying in the premier room on floor 30 over looking the harbour was a good choice. Staff wete very friendly and I would particularly like to thank Ramesh the front desk manager for going out of his way to really our stay a memorable one. Its staff like Ramesh that makes this hotel different to others. I would also like to acknowledge Fairul in the Rise restaurant for going out of his way to make our dinner a very pleasant one.  He appeared to be a natural hospitality staff who is passionate at what he was doing.,5,May 2019,
Iconic Hotel that lives upto its hype.,Thetravellera,"Never has a Hotel become a symbol of a city itself. Marina Bay Sands is a major tourist attraction in Singapore and it does not disappoint. This is one of the most expensive buildings in the world let alone be an expensive hotel. This building has a Casino, A Mall, and an observation deck. I had the opportunity to stay at Marina Bay Sands and it was worth the money spent.   This is home to the iconic infinity pool that has a great view of Singapore Skyline and some even stay at this hotel just to use the infinity pool and take some cool snaps. The service and the check in was a bit delayed but we can understand as this hotel is so huge and has thousands of visitors every day. Staying at this hotel is a once in a lifetime experience which will never forget.",5,June 2018,
"Fantastic Pool, Comfy Room & Great Views!",claireemma209,"Spacious Bathroom with luxurious bath tub and separate shower. Comfy clean room for family of 2 adults & 2 kids with great City view. Picture perfect Fun moments at the Infinity Pool, Kids Pool & Relaxing Jacuzzis. Happy with the variety of cafes, family friendly & celebrity restaurants and bars to go to. Nice shopping around the hotel compound (The Shoppes Mall). Convenient to travel with the underground Bayfront MRT train just below the Hotel Casino. Able to view the 15-min Spectra Laser Light & Water Fountain jets show from the privacy of our room on the 32nd floor (though we liked to watch it at Level 1 near the river as we could hear the show's music too). The promenade stretch seemed like a popular path for joggers, cyclists & dog walkers.",5,May 2019,
Great hotel with an amazing view,ChrisWhite75,"Stayed here for 2 nights in April. Chose a bigger room with a city view, and above the 40th floor. Was given the 46th floor with an amazing view. Large comfortable bed, great shower pressure, perfect wifi, and quality room service. The rooftop pool for guests was one of the best I’ve ever been in. On one side of the building you get city views over the bay, and the other side you get the gardens by the bay. Perfect location for plenty of sightseeing activities. Shopping at the base of the building. Staff were fantastic and friendly. Even given a complimentary drink as you wait in line to check-in! I cannot fault this hotel. I will stay here again for sure.

Had high expectations...,AAquilina90,"For a luxury hotel, I had very high expectations leading up to my stay at Marina Bay Sands, but I was slightly disappointed. My fiance and I stayed in a garden facing view on the 34th floor (Tower 3) for one night. On check in, we were able to check in early... it was a lovely surprise! Thank you Marina Bay Sands. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful at the counters and in and around the hotel area. Check out was extremely smooth and they were able to hold our bags.  The room was quite nice, with a large bathroom (great shower I must say, but no fan so it gets really steamy!) with a variety of amenities.

Very comfortable and everything within easy reach,Chris B,An exceptionally well positioned hotel with rooms either have a view of the city or the park and sea. We had a sea view and what a view. We were on the 14th floor which is perfect as you look at the view rather than down on the view.   A must is the infinity pool on the roof with stunning views over the city. Great at both dawn and dusk with an adult only section. The pool is for residents only and you will need your room card.  Some great bars and restaurants are also up here however be prepared to pay for the view in their prices.  Staff were friendly and welcoming in the main the only exception for us was the receptionist when we checked in .... not the best first impression.

"Okay, but Hide your belongings ",noleintx,"Hi. I am writing a review of this hotel from a cab on my way to another hotel. The resort is beautiful. The views unlike much else anywhere. It is expensive $400 a night for the room, $53 for breakfast, etc.. It is exclusive. And there’s an air of elitism here. It’s Fine. But the room is ordinary. I had a view of the convention center roof. (Ask for a higher floor - 10 or above for a better view). And there are many non-guests who are only there for the “Skypark”. Certainly nice, but security and dress codes make walking around a inconvenience. What was truly disappointing is something was taken from my room - not one of my valuable watches, my laptop or tablet, or even my blue tooth electronics.

Check-in was good by the lovely Jessica and we were upgraded to a suite which was a lovely gesture, at the same time we were told this came with many benefits like, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapes in Bar 55.  When we arrived at Bar 55 we where embarrassed by staff in front of other guests telling us we should not be there as we had a complimentary upgrade, I obviously explained we have access as they provided an upgrade eventually they allowed us to stay out of respect that I was on a trip for my birthday.

The personalised check-in, the very friendly and professional concierge and restaurant staff make you feel at home straight away. We had a wonderful room with balcony overlooking the gardens and were speechless when we noticed we had curtains opening and closing automatically. The infinity pool is absolutely amazing, the cocktails in the bar were excellent, the dinner selection in the buffet restaurant and the breakfast buffet were top. And in the evening you can run from one side of the hotel to the other to watch the light show in the gardens and the water and laser show in front and on the hotel facade. We enjoyed every single second of our stay.",5,May 2019,
That pool!,ging466,"Have been to Singapore multiple times but always wanted to go to that pool. Spent 2 nights here in a club room, ridiculously expensive but it did include breakfast in Club55 and canapes in the evening so I didn't have to spend any money on food. My room was huge on L47 and had a fantastic view. The pool is spectacular but is very crowded and many people hog the chairs around it. I was able to have a swim and take the photo but didn't want to stay because of the crowds. The lobby was super busy and I found that a little disconcerting and impersonal. But once I got to my room, it was very peaceful. I'm glad I stayed here but not sure that I would again.",5,March 2019,

Highlight of our holiday in Singapore,Tim E,"We decided to stay here for our last part of our holiday in Singapore and were not disappointed, so many mixed reviews about this place, but my review is based on our experience. From check in on our first day, we were treated like royalty (probably because we were in a Grand Club Room on the 37th Floor). Once we got to our room, we were not disappointed. A large room with king bed, floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the city, large bathroom with a bath where you could sit in and enjoy watching the Garden Bay light show without even walking around!

When in #Singapore for the firstime,Pankaj & Zyaira,It was my firstime to visit Singapore for a 3 days only. But I'd rather not to sleep and be on the streets walking around the beautiful city lights of #SG.Nextday still awake until i get my visa on the 3rd day. Singapore always has a clean environment that i could tell. From the local people to all there surrounding are such incredibly inseparable. Seeing Merlion and Marina Bay was a happy moment for me. I guess one day will be back again here. Sadly i just missed universal studio which is everyone's landmark. Well theres always a time for everything.

Overrated,Sue,"The hotel is overrated and the money not worth it. We had a room in Tower 1 for 3 and the 3rd person got a kids bed. Even though we complained they couldn't give us another room. Seems to be standard according to the receptionist. One day our room was not even cleaned. When we informed the reception their comment was: maybe you had the ""do not disturb"" button on. This was not the case as the button was broken anyway. The last evening we ordered 2 pizzas, one of them was burnt. When I called the service and told her about the burnt pizza, all she said was: I'm so sorry to hear that and I will provide your feedback to our Chef.  The hotel has several rooftop bars.

Stayed once but not an experience to repeat,CathyGri,"We booked for Easter 2019 to stay 5 nights in a deluxe garden view room. We wish we had only booked for 3 nights as that was more than enough.   We had a room on the 27th floor with lovely views of Gardens on the Bay and really enjoyed the nightly music and lights show at 7.45 pm.   Needless to say, the hotel was very busy and with 2500 rooms and lots of day visitors, the lobby was always busy. The greatest asset of this hotel is its staff who were all so friendly and willing to help.  Given how busy the hotel was, check in was fast and efficient, as was check out. This is an iconic hotel and a great feat of engineering which amazed us.  If you want a pool you can swim in or have available beds by the pool, stay somewhere else.  We never once got a sunbed by the pool although…",3,April 2019,
So Dirty,Travelingsohaa,"I went to this hotel again after a few years and they have not kept their standard. The room was so so dirty, the bathroom walls were covered with hair. The pool water was green. We checked out immediately and went to a different hotel.",1,March 2019,
"Expensive as expected , a nice touch of laser show everyday evening",royalnnair,"enjoyed the laser show. quite crowded on the promenade, could be a better view from top floor. they have two shoes at 8 and 9 pm . Hotel charges tourists a whopping fee per person for a short visit to skydesk. then theres the queue. it becomes quite an amount for a large family. instead a one day stay could be a better deal. as one can visit many places nearby and within the hotel at leisure. one has to walk a lot in Singapore. must plan for a weeks stay minimum to see few of the attractions and part of the city. Thogh the MRT & busses networks excellent one must have  budget for taxis as well. research well for food. very hot during the day so plan activities in morning, keep afternoon for rest and go out in evenings to return late",4,May 2019,
Expensive but it is iconic,MCSydney,"We stayed 2 of the 6 nights at MBS to experience the benefits of staying at MBS, that is to swim in THAT pool, like everyone else! It’s quite a pool & the view is totally impressive. However the hotel itself is already dated (still have to pay for movies) plus it is a big hotel, so the expectation of good service comes with apprehension. The TV in our room would freeze occasionally but we could not be bothered getting any help as we felt it would take ages to get someone to come. Having said this, we do not have proof. Everyone we encountered was pleasant & efficient. We travelled with a child & had to have the family room. It was too big really. Our child’s sofa bed was in our room plus there was a separate lounge & dining room. The amenities of having a casino (if it is your…",3,April 2019,

A Must do even for one night,Ben H,"We stayed here just for one night so  we  could experience the infinity  pool , we knew in advance that is very expensive  for food and drinks so we  just budgeted for it, As for the hotel it is very impressive and we weren't disappointed  at all,  all the staff we interacted with were every friendly and attentive. We had a garden facing  room which had lovely views , room was Spacious  and clean,   As for the pool it wasn't as busy as i thought so we had no problems finding sun loungers and room for the selfies!!, they have bar staff coming round serving snacks and drinks ( yes expensive)  but as i said just accept  it and enjoy the experience , definitely recommend  this place !!",5,April 2019,
vacation,stnnap,We went to Singapore to meet our relatives working in Singapore. But whwn we went to swimmingpool to have some drink while swimming & chatting. We were dismay because our 2 guests/relatives are not allowed to enter the pool sllo how we gonna chatt & drink they will be outside while we are inside the pool. Its not a friendly place.  And when we check out i let the frontdesk to asked their staff to check our room. Theybasked me if we consumed anything from the fridge i told the none. But when we are in our country a day after we left Singapore they emailed me that they will charged me a drink because it was not in their fridge. I told them i will not pay for it coz i asked them before i left Marina. Then after exchanging emails they said they will waived it out of goodwill. I told…,3,April 2019,
Everything you wanted it to be and more,InvernessMatt1971,We are staying in Thailand and decided to fly down to Thailand to celebrate my wife’s 40th Birthday so splashed out on the Marina Bay Sands.  The hotel is fabulous. We went for a garden view room as we preferred the view. Spending an afternoon in the infinity pool was something we’ll remember for the rest of our lives.  Just amazing.,5,May 2019,
Amazing experience,serenalisa57,"Our short stay at Marina Bay Sands was breath taking and very well worthwhile. Also want to thank especially Isaac at the check in counter, his service was impeccable and made our stay a memorable one!  Staff were very attentive to our requests, rooms were clean, infinity pool was absolutely beautiful. Would definitely be returning and would recommend to anyone. It’s a must stay when visiting Singapore. ",5,May 2019,
Overpriced,Andy B,"This is an impressive hotel to look at. The rooftop pool is impressive. The room was no better than any other hotel although the view from the room was awesome. The prices on the 'in-room' dining menu were equally awesome, breakfast for two was over $100. Dinner at the roof top restaurant was over $400, a G&T $22 each, a bottle of wine that you might pay $15-$18 in Australia will cost you over $AUD125. The shopping mall mentioned in previous reviews does have the most exclusive brand names in the world however, it is way to expensive to shop there. I did not see one customer in any of the 'top end' shops. You will need ro get a taxi to and from this hotel on every occasion that yo.u wish to see any of the many sights of Singapore. It is too remote to walk anywhere. Good luck if…",3,June 2018,
You get what you pay for,Stephen C,"I stayed here in November 2018 for 3 nights. Is it expensive? Yes without a doubt, BUT it is totally worth it, yes there are many many guests, our experience though was that everyone was treated as special, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years, this one is like a well oiled machine, and by far the best!

Must Stay in Singapore!,Garth S,I stayed here just a couple of days ago on my visit to Singapore and just wow. I was given a room upgrade to a higher room with an amazing view.

Excellent hospitality and professional staff.The pool on the last floor is the icing on the cake . The view is extraordinary.The overall property is itself a luxurious stay . Also the marina bay gardens is a must see. Spacious suites with the best of services offered. As it was a family vacation couldn’t have asked more much of a better experience.

Spectacular view from the Infinity Pool,Syed Adam,"Its my 3rd  ""staycation"" in Marina Bay Sands of 2019. The room was standard and basic. Cleanliness of the room was great. The view was very amazing as usual and for this time the room that we got is facing the garden. Gym was good and basic. The Infinity pool is a must for everybody to experience.",5,May 2019,
Amazing!,JudySurrey_B_C_,We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands after our cruise of Asia.  Staying at this hotel is an amazing experience.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The bathroom has very nice complimentary shampoo and lotions.  The ultimate experience is to spend time in the 'infinity pool' enjoying the view.  The observation deck is an opportunity to view the surrounding gardens and enjoy the amazing light show that takes place on the waterfront.  The Mall that is part of the hotel property is interesting with an abundance of shops & food stalls.,5,November 2018,
Marina Bay Sands Fit for a King,Jake P,"Singapore was our final destination for what I consider a ""Trip of a lifetime"". Spending 7 days in the Maldives I didn't think our trip could be topped , as we arrived late into Singapore (there were 9 of us) we were greeted by Sherman unbelievable experience and he did his upmost to make our final destination the best it could be. If it wasn't for Sherman our experience would have been the same as everyone else who was staying in this fabulous hotel.  Once again Thanks Sherman for making Marina Bay Sands everything we dreamed of :)",5,April 2019,
Incredible hotel,Catherine A,"My husband and 2 kids (7 and 3yrs old) stayed at the incredible Marina Bay Sands for 4 nights as a stop over before going to Maldives. This hotel is absolutely incredible and very unique. We had beautiful city views from our room. There is a wide variety of restaurants and in room dinning options. Gardens by the bay is close by as well as a shopping complex with all the top brand shops. The hotel has everything you need plus more. The service was always above and beyond from the moment you step out of the car to check in and check out. We were so busy each day with activities it was the perfect place to rest, unwind and recharge that we didn't feel like we needed to go anywhere else. The infinity pool is absolutely amazing. Breathtaking views. We really didn't want to leave. The…",5,April 2019,
Never disappointed,KevinG,"Last time I was at this hotel/casino was 5 years ago. I forgot how massive this place is. Everything still top notch.

King of Hotels,Joykarwan,"We celebrated our anniversary in this hotel and we have booked one night while we have another hotel for the rest of the days we have stayed in singapore, anyways the hotel is amazing, room is huge huge, facilities are perfect, cleanses is top. I advise to take city view since you will get amazing view from the big automated curtain of the huge windows in the room. I told my wife we could play football in the room as much as it is big. If you are in singapore, book one night go to swimming pool and skydeck, you are going to have alot of fun. And by the way the hotel sent chocolate cake to the room as gift for our anniversary.",5,April 2019,
Marina Bay Sands ... AMAZING,JoeKoolio,Most amazing trip and cleanest city and hotel we have ever been in ... We started with a 10 day cruise from HongKong to Singapore and in the end it cost more for 5 days at Marina Bay than the rest of the trip combined ... IT WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY !!!,5,November 2018,
Amazing but CROWDED,Tblmore,"A must see, but don’t stay there.  Other fabulous hotels in Singapore, and the Sands is like  An amusement park. So crowded with families with children and the pool is a ZOO.  Worth it to eat at Spago and the gardens are fantastic, but stay elsewhere",3,April 2019,

Superb experience-worth every penny!,Steve B,Stayed for 3 nights for my 50th Birthday-absolutely amazing room on the 31st floor looking over gardens by the bay. Beautiful room with great facilities. Can't fault anything. Special extras for my birthday made it extra special. Every staff member we came across were great and went out of their way to help.

60th for my husband with the family,Tanya Pearce,I have stayed at the Marina Bay twice before but this time was exceptional. It was my husbands 60th and we were there with a party of 9 people including family and friends of ages between 25 & 60. Most of the group would not have stayed here before or even visited Singapore. We had a fantastic experience thanks to Sherman who made our stay and my husbands 60th just perfect. Thank you Sherman it opened my eyes yet again just how special Singapore is and confirmed that Marina Bay is the best place to stay. Highly recommend. Date stayed was the 22 & 23fd of April 2019.,5,April 2019,
Superb! Lives up to all the hype!,Wayne M,Booked a club room for 3 nights. Stayed on 49th floor room 59 facing the ocean and overlooking the gardens. The room was great the views incredible. In club you get access to club 55 which has a free bar and canapés between 5-7 pm.As guests we had free access to the rooftop swimming and dining area. This was superb and open till 11pm. I recommend the night swimming. I could go on and on brilliant. Breakfast was in club 55 and was fantastic. Top tip - go club!,5,April 2019,
Worth the stay to access the rooftop pool!,cosmicgirl1978,"This was the second of three hotels we stayed at for our holiday in Singapore, and we chose it mainly so we could access the rooftop pool. The infinity pool was amazing, with incredible views, and we enjoyed lots of time up there, including free access to the SkyPark viewing deck. However, the rest of the stay there proved just as good. It is worth saying though, the hotel complex is absolutely huge and very busy, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.  Our stay started well, as check-in was incredibly smooth and helpful. We checked our suitcase in, as we thought as it was 12pm, our room wouldn't be ready. There was no need to do this, as our room was ready to check in to - fantastic!

Impressive but can feel like a busy station.,Brian083,"This hotel is massive!  Over 2000 rooms spread over 3 towers. People in the ""lobby"" constantly on the move. 15 -30 minutes wait to check in, or check out! Can be chaotic, despite the best efforts of the very helpful staff.  Ignore all this (you can't change it) and treat each tower as 1 hotel. Room 2403 in Tower 3 facing the city is brilliant. Security lifts that only work with your room key card. 2 extra large single beds, massive shower, immaculate house keeping, mini bar, iron, automatic curtains, large tv, air con,  even a phone in the loo! Step outside and be overawed with the building. Masterpiece of design, roof top terrace and infinity swimming pool. Ok, it's not cheap. Quality never is.

You have to stay here,Z2Z,"This was easily the best hotel I have every stayed in, this is the standard of customer care every hotel should have. On arrival we were taken out of the long check-in queue to the VIP check-in, this may have accounted for the stunning room on the 32nd floor. Our luggage was stored then later taken to our room. Our room wasn’t ready but we were given a pass to use the hotel facilities, and after we checked out were invited to shower in the gym before flying back to the UK. A note in the room to introduce our housekeeper and assure us that if anything was not in order then to let her know. And in any case, it’s a stunning building both in design and materials.",5,May 2019,

What an incredible view,Sean Pannell,"I visited the Marina Bay Sands hotel and visited the Sky Bar to see the views of Singapore. Top tip, if you pay to go to the observation floor you have to buy tickets and there are no benefits on that floor apart from amazing view. If you buy tickets for the Sky Bar which is in the 57th floor they give you vouchers to the same value as your tickets which you can spend at the bar, so in reality the view costs you nothing. Food and drink are available and the views are incredible. ",5,May 2019,

Pure Luxury,Philippe Mosimann,"Stayed at this hotel for one night as a luxurious night at a famous hotel. You really get what you pay for at this hotel. Our room was always clean and had a more luxurious design approach. Great views, clean room, great bathroom and comfy beds. The pool definitely is amazing with stunning views to the lion city. The staff was friendly, but you really get treated as a tourist or as a wealthy person which some guests might be used to or like. We didn't have any breakfast at this hotel, it is way to expensive! From a luxury hotel like this, it would really be nice if the breakfast was included or even maybe a special deal for hotel guests. Food and drinks in general are on the more expensive side. The location of this hotel is a tiny bit far away from the traditional and central…",4,April 2019,
Amazing Hotel! Worth a visit for sure.,Wilson L,"Had an amazing time here! We wanted to come and stay here for so long and we're so glad we finally did. Believe the hype, it is a spectacular hotel. There is a casino attached, the mall, and the public transport train is there too. Very central, and every staff there from check-in, bell boys, random staff all the way to check out have been extremely kind and helpful. The pool obviously is a must see, it is a very busy hotel, and you can easily get lost but it's amazing. I can't wait to come back again!",5,May 2019,

Staycation - Family 1 Bedroom,Kwaynf,"Stayed at the MBS Hotel for 1 night with my Wife and my 19 year old daughter who was visiting. We booked in mainly to have access to the Swimming Pool on the 57th Level.   There are Pro's and Cons as always. We really enjoyed our stay. The checkin was really easy and the staff are extremely nice at the front desk. The serve refreshments and ice cream while waiting, which wasn't very long.   We stayed in the Family 1 bedroom and I can say the room itself was very nice and very spacious. The pull out couch which was located in the outer living room was not comfortable. Suitable for a 6 year old maybe but not a larger teenager or adult. Very lumpy like most pull out couches so don't expect anything better. Our biggest grip was the location of the room. We were on the 4th floor and…",4,May 2019,

We also visited in a tour , but that was only to the 56th floor . The queues at night are enormous. Yet another Singapore ‘must visit ‘ venue/attraction.

Would have been let down if we hadn't booked a Club room,Gurps Basra,Stayed here for 5 nights in a Club room with an amazing view of the marina. This hotel is very busy so do not expect relaxation.   Check In – Check in was a little slow but the staff were coming around with drinks to keep everyone refreshed in the queue. We arrived early and the room we were told would not be ready for another hour. They gave us guest keys in the meantime and advised we could go up and check out the pool or go for afternoon tea in the Club lounge while we waited.   Room – Great view in our room of the marina which is what we had requested and did not disappoint. Great view for the light show that happens every evening 8pm. 9pm and 10pm.   Pool – Went to the pool for literally half hour was not impressed at all. The water was cold and the pool was full of people…,3,April 2019,
Superb!,Polyester,"Fabulous hotel, but we had a hiccup with our booking and dealing with a Concierge man who had never heard of commonsense made me very frustrated.  I walked away and returned 10 minutes later to speak with someone who was able to solve the problem very easily.  We had three rooms in total, 2 on the 30th floor and 1 on the 19th.  The 30th is obviously better to see the lighting show and also access the pool on the 57th floor.  The lift servicing the 19th floor terminates at 22, you then change lifts to reach the top, so we spent a great deal of time in and out of lifts!!  Rooms very large, also the bathrooms with double sinks and then toilet and shower each had their own doors,  There are no changing rooms by the pool, but towels are provided.

Amazing night view over the city from the 39th Floor.....,454lindylou,"I first visited the Sky Deck of the MBS in 2016 and knew then that the next visit to Singapore would be in this hotel. The club rooms are amazing and we'll worth the money, especially for the view. The club lounge on the other hand was good, but not as good as other 5* hotel we have stayed in. We had to register in a room tucked away in the corner of the building, which was smart and comfortable with hot and cold drinks at our disposal. Although we enjoyed our time at MBS and the pool was amazing, the thing I love about entering a 4* + hotel is their amazing lobby's with great artwork, plush furnishings and chandeliers. The MBS is like entering a huge shopping mall with a hotel on the upper floors...",5,April 2019,
Excellent location and unique pool,Adrian S,"This is among the best places to stay if you have in plan to visit the main touristic areas. Most can be quickly reached on foot, and for the rest there's a short Grab or MRT.   Get the cheapest room possible. It's not like you're going to admire the skyline or garden for hours on end from your top floor suite...  Go to the pool as often as possible, although crowded most of the time the experience is truly memorable. If you stay until 11 PM when the pool closes, you'll be able to take some great night-time pictures.  The breakfast is simply amazing in diversity, the array of choices is almost dizzying if you eat at the Rise restaurant. On the top floor the view is nicer but there's less choice of food. Also - expensive. My recommendation is to get a room w/o breakfast and…",5,April 2019,

Was worth the money,jerudo,"It's a very expensive hotel for the tourists, and we decided to just stay 1 night there. Our room on the 32nd floor was a Garden View room, but it also had a nice view of the ocean.   My family went to the famous rooftop swimming pool during the afternoon and at nighttime. Both hours had simply magnificent views of the city and sea.I also tried out the rooftop bar later on. That place had a very nice vibe too--with a DJ and live musician indoor, and again some great views outside.  If you're willing to pay extra money while in Singapore, then I do recommend this place.",5,April 2019,
Boats that fly,Nayarafnasc,"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but what usually gets me at the end is the not so 5 star customer service. Marina bay sands was wonderful, the staff was great throughout our entire stay to the very end.   Our flight leaving Singapore wasn’t until late at night and they were able to store our luggage with access to it whenever we needed and also offered us a room to shower so we weren’t sticky from being outside all day before catching our flight.  Club55 is good, but still not sure if it’s worth all the hype. To have access you do need to be staying at the hotel in a room with club access so it was nice and quiet compared to some of the other options.   Great nightclub on the 57th floor also.

Family trip to Singapore over Easter Weekend,Lauren S,"Our family of 4 (kids ages 9 & 6) booked a Family Room at MBS over Easter weekend, arriving on a Friday night and staying until Monday morning. I had been prepared for the family room to be on a low floor with poor views - but we totally lucked out with a room on the 27th floor with a view of Gardens by the Bay! We had a huge balcony/terrace with 2 seating areas as well. The room itself was very spacious with a king sized bed, TV/console divider, and then a double pull out couch for the kids. Like everyone we were there for the pool and took full advantage of jet lag with 6AM swims!

The place to be if you are in Singapore,pizote67,"Yes, maybe it hasn't the colonial atmosphere you would like in a hotel in Singapore. Yes, sometimes it looks like an aiport lounge. But when you arrive from the airport the first thing you see of the city is Marina Sands Bay and you will never forget this vision, NEVER! We arrived at 8am and checkin was so fast. Our room was not ready and we took a visit at Gardens by the Bay. Lunch at Satay by the bay (very good!), back to hotel at 2pm and lift to infinity pool (WOW!!!). Relaxed at the pool 'til 6pm then we visited Marina Sands shops and after dinner the light show of super trees from the Marina Bay Deck.",5,April 2019,
Level 37 at MBS,Kaylah D,"I arranged a surprise Singapore trip for my husband’s birthday and as a once off been able to stay at MBS was icing on the cake. Firstly through all my research I found booking directly through MBS website was the cheapest and easiest.  We arrived early so decided to leave our bags at the luggage holding check point that was easy and quick with no hassles.  We arrived back at 2:30pm to check in and the line was very short, I didn’t wait for more than 5 minutes. Customer service check in was excellent, friendly, professional and very accommodating.

Great place,Jon I,Had to go and see this hotel and were allowed to go to the top to the bar to have drinks. We arrived at just after 10 and within seconds you are deposited at the top to be greeted by friendly staff and to this amazing view. Drinks are expensive but not much more than you would pay in any 5 start hotel and whilst charged $56 to go to the top it is given back to you with drinks.  What a fabulous few hours spent looking at the view and having cocktails and just very relaxing. Hotel looks great and just amazingly built. Huge recommendation to see if only for the view.We were not allowed into the pool area as we were not guests but saw lot's of people in gowns coming from the pool and they looked happy.,5,,
Excellent Hotel with too many people,RaoulM,"The Hotel is clearly a must when visiting Singapore. In my personal opinion, the hotel is like a Mall, with a lot of people, the check in process is not very fluent, even though we were offered water and Ice creams while waiting, still slow.  If you want to swim in the famous pool, you must stay in the hotel, besides that, the hotel is more an tourist attraction than a place to rest and enjoy the city. Is very well located, so you could probably visit Singapore and stay the whole place (Hotel, Pool, Mall, etc) so it is up to personal choices.",4,April 2019,
Second stay at Marina Bay!,Sarah,"The hotel itself is stunning as the architecture is amazing! The roof top pool is a great experience and looking over the bay from the Skydeck is also great. However, due to it being so popular it does have a 'conveyer belt' feel to the stay. There are always masses of people checking in and out and pool itself gets very hectic. The rooms are very nice and well kept, but nothing exceptional.  It's definitely exciting to stay there and enjoy the facilities, but it's not a luxury hotel experience!",4,December 2018,
Dream Hotel,Rick,"I booked and upgraded this hotel to 45 floor. This was a dream and best experience we ever had. It’s got the view and infinity pool was the best experience we ever had. If you visit Singapore, please stay at this place at list for 1 night to experience what it offers. Worth the money spent",5,April 2019,
Came for the pool- once is enough,Ashley,"I came, I saw, I swam.  Hotel is what one might expect- a gorgeous, overpriced wonder with everyone taking photos at the pool.  The service was average.  The room size was spacious.  Overall, I don’t regret staying here but would consider a different hotel for my future Singaporean travels.  Once the novelty of the pool and architecture wears off, the value of staying here take a plunge for me.",4,April 2019,
Wow Singapore you Shine!,Rox E E,"First time in Singapore and only have three nights?  Well, this is definitely the place to stay.    Great service, great rooms, incredible views from the pool and plenty of nightlife with terrific restaurants at your doorstep.  Hawkers markets are nearby if you want to try what the locals eat!",5,April 2019,
Another great stay at MBS,Simon S,"Our second time at this hotel, the room was immaculate and staff service impeccable, especially the lovely ladies in club55; Ellaine, Sabrina, Jesan, Farah, Kate and June-May. After just one visit they remembered our names and greeted us by name every time we visited the club lounge.  The rooftop pool was very busy as usual and sometimes difficult to get a lounger.  MBS is not a cheap hotel, however we recommend paying extra to get a club room as the service and food quality of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés is outstanding as is the free flowing champagne offered in the early evening (piper-heidsinck). You also get a room high up in tower 2 which is convenient to get to the pool.  Xi-mei cleaned our room beautifully and made the towel sculptures pictured.  If we…",5,April 2019,
Disappointing,Mark296,"My wife and I had a 3 night stop over in Singapore and set 1 night aside to stay here as it was something we had wanted to do for years. Our experience was extremely disappointing and left us wishing we had just stayed at the Pan Pacific where we spent the the 2 nights previous and was by far a better hotel. The service at Marina Bay Sands was terrible. The staff were slow, rude and really unhelpful. I’m guessing they reserve the best service for those arriving in Bentley’s or who are wearing Rolex’s. The room was very underwhelming and the hotel had the fell of a shopping mall. Then there was the pool. Wow it was awesome to spend the afternoon in a pool with a thousand other people. I’m sure my review would have been better if it wasn’t for the atrocious service we experienced…",2,April 2019,
Its the heart of Singapore,genuine_saj,"Due to the size of the hotel be prepared to wait to be checked in. You do have an option of not paying a deposit that will keep the fridge locked.  The best thing about the room are the views. Otherwise the room looks pretty average. What was nice was the electric blinds theat open automatically as soon as you enter the room, 3 ply toilet tissue and the TWG tea bags but no bidet in the toilet. The shower functional but basic. The views from the obsevation deck are amazing. Best has to be the infinity pool that goes to the edge of the building. You can tell from the skypark this is no ordinary hotel. I would recommend at least spending one night so you can experience the skypark as its only available for the hotel guests. The other benefit is the gardens by the bay,the water…",4,April 2019,
Simply stunning!,Dave W,"We stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Singapore. The hotel is everything you would expect and the staff and food were both absolutely excellent, but the pictures do not do the infinity pool justice. Its simply stunning, with views out over Marina Bay on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other. And, surprisingly its not crowded, there are lots of loungers available to watch the Singapore skyline from.",5,April 2019,
a-must staycation in SG,Chi R,"We had the best sleeping and waking moments with an awesome view of Gardens by the Bay. Service was superb. Our room was cleaned several times a day. The staff were all courteous, very attentive to all our requests and honest. I left ex gratia for the housekeeping every time but nobody took them so I enclosed them with a thank you note on our last day.  Don't miss cocktails by the pool during sunset. It's a bit crowded while we were there but the view was so amazing so we didn't mind having a lot of photobombers. It's absolutely on the pricey side but with the kind of service we've experienced, I wouldn't mind coming back.",5,April 2019,
Swimming in the sky,mren,We spend 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands hotels and we had 2 connecting skyline view rooms.  The service was excellent from the arrival at the airport to the return.  The view and the roof top pools are unique and are worth the experience.  We enjoyed the food court next door as a much more relaxed atmosphere and huge variety of choices.  The hotel can be quite busy at time with long queues at checking or check out but we were spare those by check-in in the room.  We definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Singapore.,5,April 2019,
Simply wow! The place to stay in Singapore,ARate4U,"This is simply the place to stay in Singapore. Choose a room with city view (Deluxe with Sky View are perfect) and you will be delighted. Perfectly located, with plenty of services and amenities like the famous infinity pool (a bit crowed) and the sky deck.  Simply wow!",5,April 2019,
A place to spend a day for tourist,mlam18,"Even you can't afford to stay in this hotel, there are things you can do at low cost or no cost. The food court here is not as expensive as the restaurants in the hotel.  There are two light shows every night at the Garden by the Bay as well as another one in front of the Bay, both are free.",5,April 2019,
Main attraction,Stanley N,This is a must stay for anyone who loves to travel. From the moment you walk in you are treated with royalty. I have no complaints at all about this place. I got a free upgrade too because it was my first time there.,5,April 2019,
Amazing service!,rahbymamea,"Was greeted by two lovely concierge staff Iryn and Aram who done a lovely job checking us into our hotel rooms. Iryn was on your first day but done a spectacular job nevertheless. She Was very professional and accommodating, alongside her trainer Aram who was very helpful with our requests.  Marina Bay Sands is a great place to visit, and wouldn't be the way it is without the friendly staff whom I encountered.",5,April 2019,
Mixed feelings - hidden costs vs location.,Luvinspoonful,"Check in is slow, the large foyer is currently under constructions will likely be more welcoming when completed. We had booked two rooms and we were split on to different floors (irritating) Elevators are also slow and you need to swipe room key wait for board to flash and then press floor. We paid for the premium rooms and one certainly was - the other was not. The room on floor 27 had an obstructed view, no verandah and was very dank smelling (like a laundromat). Floor 29 had sweeping views of the gardens from the verandah. The toiletries are very high quality. Rooms are reasonably clean, blandly dressed and not in brand new condition with reasonable wear and tear, the design layout is impractical in part (bathroom and toilet lights are located next to door, toilet and shower…",4,April 2019,
Don’t have to leave,jnlv2trvl,Great thing about staying at MBS is you do not need to leave the hotel. Singapore is so hot and humid I don’t want to leave the hotel. We came for the new Marquee. Cut steak and Blossom were delicious. Adrift have great cocktails and Lavo great view. Marquee was fun. The food court is open 24/7 so great place after club. Room was spacious love our housekeeper.   Minus one star when we got off taxi nobody came to help us with our luggage. I told the front desk and couple guys were free standing around.,4,April 2019,
Well Worth It!,Mike Macrone,"When booking this hotel I had doubts that it would be worth as much per night as a Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental (all are on the Marina Bay). But upon check in I knew I had made the right choice! For reference, I had booked the Premier Room City View.  Firstly, they let me check in at 7:00 AM! I was expecting them to say the room wasn't ready, but they were very accommodating and gave me a room right away. Upon entering the room I could see why this is a 5-star hotel. Great room and amenities.   Second, the POOL is INCREDIBLE! I am not a huge sit by the pool and do nothing person, but here, I spent hours in the pool and sitting by it. Where else can you be 57 floors up swimming around looking over the city?! This was very, very impressive! The pool alone is worth spending…",5,April 2019,
Memorable visit,peter5w,"We stayed here on 28th May one night on way to aus. A experience to remember, a fabulous iconic hotel that deserves its reputation. View from 18th floor garden view was spectacular.Could easy become impersonal due to size but this is negated by staff being so helpful and willing to please.Even buffet breakfast in any of designated restaurants was excellent.The person who seats you once learns your name Thanks you by name as you leave helps keep it personal. Also who can leave without mentioning infinity pool on top floor this was worth the one day visit on its own",5,May 2018,
Impressing hotel,Apple2301,Stayed for layover night in a Premier City View Twin room. Very spacious. Twin bed too small to sleep with kids. Should be queen size for that. Pool was crowded as expected.  Positive atmosphere was caused by sunset and dawn light. Spago cocktails and sushi quite good but not special enough for the prices. Overall very impressive hotel if you are looking for crowded environment wherever you go.,4,April 2019,
Always best.,AndreSIndrawan,"If you haven't had a chance to stay in this hotel, then you should do.  This is my April visit to this hotel and I put some infinity pools photos at night.  It was beautiful scenery from 57th floors of Sands Skypark especially at evening time.  Love it",5,April 2019,
Amazing experience!,KM1787,Stayed at the hotel for one day before flying home and couldn’t have had a better experience. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. We had been staying in Singapore for a week and so were early for check in. Arriving at about 11am we walked straight up to check in - no queue and was greeted by a lovely lady who explained our room wasn’t quite ready but that we could register which would allow us to get a key and head up to the infinity pool. Amazing! We left our luggage at reception and headed up to level 57. The pool was not too busy at this time so we got seats right on the water. The pool itself is spectacular and a must see if you’re in Singapore. We received a text 30mins later saying our room was ready but decided to stay at the pool. Cocktails are delish and…,5,April 2019,
W O W,JillianZhu,My family can’t get over the beauty of the skypool. It overlooks the entire city. Safety is being prioritized and people in the pool are supervised with pool guards. You must try atleast once in a life time to go to this place..,5,April 2019,
Exceptional,Sharon S,We recently stayed and it was a wonderful experience. From the moment we entered the foyer the service was second to none. We were ushered to a VIP space to check in and then offered a superb upgrade from level 4 to level 43 and of course we accepted. The fixtures of the hotel and our suite were fantastic. The staff are friendly and super attentive. So glad we got to stay here.,5,April 2019,
"Superb from the outside, 5/10 on the inside",Mickyx47,"From the outside of the hotel it looks stunning, if arriving at night even more so. Once you step out of the taxi forget any type of personal experience. You become part of the other 5000 people staying there. Staff are rude and you are offered no assistance with cases. Once inside good luck finding where you are meant to check in, especially if you pay the extra for a club room. Once you get to your room be ready to be dissapointed. Club rooms with garden view are smaller than rooms on the other side of the hotel (cleverly you are shown the large room even if you book a garden room... naughty). The infinity pool is impossible to get to with every man and his selfie stick vying for space. Trying to find a spot for a drink in the evening which felt luxurious was impossible. Worth…",3,April 2019,
Most luxurious hotel I've stepped into,ASH K,"Wow. What a hotel. The architecture, rooms, views and staff are incredible. Didn't want to leave here. Club access gave a huge room, afternoon tea, Champaign etc. Breakfast on top floor was incredible and enjoyed the pool. Can't wait to come back ",5,April 2019,
"Great on the outside, ok on the inside. ",Antonio E,"Best way I can describe MBS is if McDonald’s was a hotel it would be Marina Bay Sands. It genuinely feels like a drive through. There is nothing really wrong with it, it just feels impersonal and detached.  Architecturally it’s a marvel of engineering but it lacks the most important bit... personality.  The pool attracts the worst kind of visitors, the social media influencers and bloggers. Selfie here, selfie there, take a photo of everything I’m consuming. Oh and Russians. Those pesky Russians and their desire to wear the hotel provided robe and slippers from their hotel room on level 4 all the way to the pool on level 57. For some reason the rest of the folk follow that trend.  Breakfast at Rise is simply outstanding, pay the money folks and enjoy a great breakfast. Lavo,…",3,April 2019,
Very busy with people ground floor and the pool area.,Robyn P,Too popular with tourists. Meaning even upgrade areas are busy. Not as central as other hotels but does have good views. Good food options. Shops aligned are high class. Staff are great and well trained,4,April 2019,
"Wow, absolutely stunning",hjcavanagh,"We decided to stay here for one night during our recent visit to Singapore, it lived up to all our expectations and more. The infinity pool on the top is amazing and offers panoramic views of this amazing city. The hotel offers so much to see and do. Check in was easy and we were able to check in early and leave our luggage whilst being able to access the pool and observation deck. The view from our room was gorgeous as we had a garden facing room in tower 3. We watched the tree show from our balcony, truly beautiful. We were able to eat within the hotel with a child and felt welcomed. The shopping available within the hotel is on another level and whilst we weren’t there to spend, we enjoyed the experience of walking through seeing all that sparkles!",5,April 2019,
a memorable family holiday,Sandeep S,this was my third visit to this hotel so as we had arrived around 2 pm in the afternoon and we had booked some higher category rooms we were in the ever waiting check in queue more in the front and were lucky that our rooms were ready as still some people were asked to wait as check in time is 3 pm and check out time is 11 am they really need a lot of time to get the rooms done > the lobby as usual crowded as if the rooms are for free and mind you this prices here are not cheap> now for the good things the rooms as usual good > the shopping mall and the casino it has all what else you need and to top it all the infinity pool just amazing loved it the service and the cocktails at the pool deck just amazing > one word Enjoyed my stay,5,March 2019,
Just a number here,Jeff W,"Excelent location to see night show at the gardens and laser show. Room is average and has my pet hate auto mini bar. Pool is good but far too busy. Resort on a whole is way too touristy. If you are going to stay here do it for a night, tick the box and go somewhere else. There are many better options in Singapore.",3,April 2019,
Really Nice Hotel,Michael D,"You cannot miss it, with its three tall towers with boat strung across the three towers. We were having high tea in the Renku Bar & Lounge on the ground floor. Then after tea we visited the Sky Park viewing platform.",5,March 2019,
Stunning Evening,GiseleReid,4 friends visited Ce la vi club lounge for drinks. Great atmosphere in this bar.  We were served by Sandeep who has extremely good customer care and is very professional.  Strongly advise a trip here when in Singapore,5,March 2019,
Bullet trip,windrumw,"Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on a 3 night trip for a friends birthday.  Checking in was no problem and our room was up graded. The room was very clean with views out to the garden and sea.  The infinity pool opens at 6am and this is probably the best time to go get a lounger by the pool, we were still on uk time so this was not a problem. The pool does get very very busy but it is a must to visit and see Singapore from a high height.  The hotel is very large with three towers. Again it does get very busy but the size of the hotel can accommodate this. There are several restaurants and bars around to visit. Try happy hour!!!!!  There is a large shopping mall under the hotel with all the worlds top designers which my wife found to her delight.  All in all this was a great hotel…",5,March 2019,
Luxurious and over-the-top,goingwhereicanwhenican,"I stayed at MBS one night because it was too expensive to stay for the entire length of our trip to Singapore.  You have to stay there to actually use the infinity pool but outside guests can go to the top to take pictures without being in the pool. Though definitely luxurious and we don't gamble and we thought it the location was just so-so.  We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel because Singapore is all about the hawker stands.  We did like that it was close to Gardens by the Bay but it's proximity to everything else was a little bit far for walking. We moved to a boutique hotel in Chinatown afterward and liked that vibe a lot more.  Besides the pool, it was just another very big and over the top and overrated hotel but still a great experience just for that one…",4,May 2018,
"Nice pool and good view, but everything else is average",19Sophie87,"The Infinity Pool is certainly great and the view from the hotel rooms is rather nice. But to be honest, that's it. I've stayed in this hotel a few times now but I probably won't return. The hotel is way too big and you have the feeling of being on a market rather than in a five star hotel. There are much better places to stay in Singapore if you are looking for beautiful and luxurious rooms as well as personalized and polite service (e.g., Raffles, InterContinental, Fullerton).  We also visited the bar and the drinks were average (if at all). Interestingly, however, the bar keeper did not engage with us nor was he friendly above average, but he gave everyone a card with his name asking to write a positive TripAdvisor review about him. Well.. Looks like this place is desperately…",3,April 2019,
SIMPLY SUPERB,Nmasher,"Excellent hotel, luxurious and modern. big rooms with all amenities. very child friendly. lots of things to do- rooftop pool with amazing views, a huge casino, luxury shopping and many many food outlets. fine dining to food courts it has all. location is good and not far from the main places. overall enjoyed thoroughly",5,April 2019,
Out of this world,Windsor34,"Utterly amazing! Booked a club room which allows access to lounge book in rather than front desk, treated like VIP’s, we were upgraded to a suite which was such a wonderful surprise! What this hotel manages to do is make you feel special despite many visitors and lots of tourists. Once in the tower blocks the busyness outside melts away, you truly feel you have exclusive access to one of the most amazing hotels in the world! The suite was breathtaking with views that surpassed anything experienced before. Every need is catered for, bath products fabulous and the beds and pillows so comfy. Staff are so attentive everything is thought of and when needed so prompt in their service. Club rooms are the way to experience this hotel, the club 55 access was superb, food exceptional at…",5,April 2019,
Whats not to love!!,angester,I was lucky enough to spend nearly a week at the stunning Marina Bay Sands at a work conference.  It really didn't disappoint.  Of course you can't really swim in the infinity pool - its for taking selfies and watching the sunset!  And yes its absolutely huge but I found the service excellent and my room was beautiful. I had a view out on the bay and could lie in bed and happily watch the lights of the city.  Just magnificent.  There is a massive shopping centre below (some high street but mainly high end!) and lots of restaurant choices - my favourite was Lavo.  I would definitely splash out to spend another night in this gorgeous spot!!,5,September 2018,
AWESOME LOCATION,Dilip Desai,Worth visiting on any trip to Singapore. Accessible from any part of Singapore by Taxi Rooms are not only bigger in size but have fabalous view. Breakfast is excellent and includes  Indian Menu. Reception staff is courteous.,5,April 2019,
A must if staying in Singapore,Ahmed Riaz,"The world famous infinity pool is not to be missed.  The hotel is huge with top service. However because of its size and modern design it is more like a hub than a luxury hotel.   Other than that, the restaurants and service is second to none. Definitely worth at least a 1 night stay to experience the pool and stunning views.  Follow me on instagram for pics, videos and reviews @gentlemans_journeys",4,July 2018,
Great Location for Singapore Stay,Craig W,"My husband and I stayed in an Orchid Suite with city views with our Grandson for our six night stay. I must say, the room was beautiful! We were on the 51st floor, and had a great view of the city and the light show that was being presented on the bay each night we were there. Our room was not cheap, but included access to the infinity pool and Club 55 for pre-dinner drinks and nibbles. However, we found that if you did not arrive at Club 55 right on 5pm, you often could not get a seat and so missed out on the drinks/nibbles included in your room price. Also, although the infinity pool offered great views it was soooooo crowded, and getting a seat was virtually impossible. If we were to stay here again I would definately book a cheaper room - lets face it, we will still be close…",4,April 2019,
SPECTACULAR VIEW,Sharon Legaspi,"My friends and I enjoyed  our two night stay in Marina bay sands, a hotel with airy quarters in a vibrant property with an infinity pool & a spa, plus the high-end restaurants, bars, and a big shopping arcade. Located at Bayfront MRT station and steps away from the lively Central business district. This place has everything for you to spend an awesome and relaxing time. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 33rd floor: the view from our balcony was truly amazing and breath taking. We we're extremely happy about the overall experience of this hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with all the basic amenities. We would surely stay there again. Looking forward to a wonderful chance to come back to Singapore. ",5,July 2018,
A WOW experience,Diane N,"This hotel is the Icon of Singapore and just amazing to stay.  Service is incredible and the room does not disappoint.  I booked this a year in advance and did get a reasonable price but it can be pricey.  Our room was oversized and had a 12'x12' balcony overlooking the Gardens by the Bay.  We were able to watch the light show at night and even hear the music since we were on the 25th floor.  The hotel has a huge shopping and restaurant area and casino.  You can get lost here!  The infinity pool on the 57th floor in the Skypark is something that you just have to see.  Its amazing and so cool because there is an adult only pool, keeping the kids at a distance.  Plan on spending some time at the pool and especially go at sunset and enjoy the night lights of the city.  It was one…",5,April 2019,
Ticking it off the list,Michael-Traveller-JP,"This is a WYSIWYG place. The architecture is spectacular, views are spectacular, the pool is spectacular. But that’s about it.  Rooms are spacious, but not special. Service is spotty and often unpersonal, unfriendly and inattentive. The pool area is very crowded.  Food outlets are all pricey, but with good quality.  So we ticked this one off our list of places too visit and enjoyed the spectacularness of the place. But it’s quite unfortunate that they have not succeeded to keep the personal touch that visitors expect when paying top dollars.  ",4,April 2019,
A tick on the bucket list,marbella2011,"We are regular visitors to Singapore and always like the idea of staying at MBS to be able to use the pool. The pool did not disappoint- views are spectacular. We have been up to the rooftop bar on previous visits but it is so lovely being able to use the pool. Rooms are lovely and have all the needed amenities, however this is a corporate style hotel and therefore the rooms are quite basic in style. We had a harbour view over looking gardens by the bay. We loved staying and cocktails by the pool are great! They are pricy if you are used to uk prices however they are online with Singapore alcohol prices.",4,April 2019,
Relaxing holiday,Dokistar,"This place was the perfect escape from reality. We enjoyed their club lounge,infinity pool view and some restaurants. All were exellent.Their service was also great.Room was clean,well firnished.My recommend is upgrading ur stay. ",5,April 2019,
Beautiful hotel,Misha Z,"We stayed 1 day at this hotel and I think this is enough because it is very expensive and not too luxury from inside. The club lounge was a little bit disappointing because the food was not as good as I expected and it was very crowded so that sometimes people had to wait outside the club until there will be places. Moreover, the queues for the registration to the hotel was very big (for those who take the lounge access they have another queue in another room which is great and fast). The big big big advantage of this hotel is the 57 floor - the pool. It is so amazing !!! So beautiful and the cocktails there were great! It is mandatory to be there!!! Overall, we liked the hotel and it was great to be there for 1 night.",5,April 2019,

Not to be missed,Ladylucas1,While reasonably expensive (frankly what isn’t in Singapore?) this beautiful hotel is not to be missed. The staff and their attention to detail have been amazing! Thank you to Allie in reservations- we love our city view room! Just got to see the sound and light show from our room. The room service was fabulous and even the cleaners are so fantastic leaving us extra tea bags because they could see we liked tea!,5,,
Short holiday,Susan O,"Just spent three days at Marina Bay Sands, very big hotel with lots and lots of people, rooms are  quite spacious.Directions to places are not very well signed, we asked how to go to the gardens and they sent us over to the shopping centre. we ended up going through a construction site to go over to the park and gardens. Breakfast very expensive $100 for two people.we went over to the shopping centre and had dinner at The Nostra Cucina restaurant we had pizza and it was lovely, great service as well. We also had lunch at Firlino across the water lovely restaurant and food, the chef also told us how to cook the lamb we had.",4,April 2019,
Fantastic views,Donna C,"We stayed for 2 nights in a stopover from the UK to New Zealand so it was a place for us to chill and relax before another long flight.    The hotel is central and within walking distance to most sights.  The restaurants are really good however they can be very expensive and close early therefore it is better to check on arrival times etc.  The rooms are very spacious and have good amenities.  The pool area can be very full particularly in the evening and regardless of if you have a bed and personal belongings on them people will still try to sit on them while you are in the pool.  The reception area is large with adjoining shops, walkway to the gardens, restaurants etc therefore it can get extremely busy so you don't get the personnel feel that it's a hotel.  We ordered room…",4,March 2019,
Top of the world experience!,Karca,"We had a marvelous corner view room. Extremely spacious and comfortable! Club 55 is a great amenity and experience in this grand hotel.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are wonderful experiences within walking distance on the property.",5,April 2019,

Falls Down on The Small Things,Marwinkle1,"Stayed here for 2 nights for my 50th Birthday, which was the day of check in.  If you have a Club Room you get to check in at a seperate area to the right of normal check in, which was much quicker.  Don’t forget to take a number when you arrive and enjoy the free water or coffee whilst you wait. Despite requesting an early check in, and yes, I know this is not guaranteed, the room wasn’t ready at 1.00 so we went off to explore the shops and awaited the SMS to tell us the room was ready. As it happens we were busy looking around and so headed back to reception at 4.00, no SMS received. The room was ready although if we were waiting for it and not busy exploring I would have been really annoyed to have waited so long.  Little did I know at the time that my husband had ordered…",4,April 2019,
"Do it once, if only to swim in the pool in the evening and sunrise",Debbie P,"Booked the executive package and no waiting around for check in. Yes it is large and lacks personality, however the service from the staff remains very good and of the highest standard.  No queues for elevators and yes the pool was busy in the afternoon so best avoided as lots of screaming children running around. We went for a swim at 2100 and again at 0600 and it was bliss, much quieter than the day and no problems finding a poolside lounger. Swimming 57 floors over the Singapore skyline is what this hotel is about, and we loved it.",5,April 2019,
Just amazing,whokickmydog,"The MBSs has 3 towers. It is a jaw dropping hotel. Its magnificent. We booked quite late for Dec 2018 and only managed to get a garden view room. Not a problem both views  are amazing. However, at check-in the lovely lady checking us in noticed from my date of birth that I was probably have a milestone holiday, which we were.  She checked us into the room booked and then said to give her a few minutes. She managed to give us as city facing room on a really upper floor. WOW..... The room was very large and clean. Amazing views, large bathroom with everything you would expect from such a hotel.  Swimming - WOW WOW WOW. Guest can use the infinity pool which the kids enjoyed to the max.  What a hotel  Go on treat yourself.",5,December 2018,
Expensive but solely for pool access,Leisuretraveller11,Stayed here for one night. From the start you could tell this hotel is overpriced with quality lacking. Solely pool access is why everyone is here! The check in was slow and long. Felt like I was queuing for a Ryanair flight. The room was starting to look run down as it clearly has not been touched up since the venue opened 9yrs ago. Definitely not 5* compared to other hotels in Singapore. Staff are generally helpful but clearly they are overworked with the sheer number of hotel guests.   The pool was an mixed experience. It was extremely busy around sunset with no loungers free. Loungers are cramped next to each other and the again the pool is not big enough too accomodate everyone wanting to take selfies etcs during peak periods.  I stayed here only for the pool and got what I…,4,April 2019,

Extravagant,Knoc,"World’s Best and pricey hotel. Our numerous visit in this hotel but it never gets old. Pricey rooms, crowded infinity pool but with stunning view of Singapore. All filipino staffs in this hotel are friendly",5,April 2019,
Superb 5 Star Treatment,Charlesfield O,"Best service.  At the duration of the stay, we get legit luxurious treatment.  All  the staff are VERY accommodating.  From baggage, check-in, room service, Club 55 service, pool, Spagoo, check out, operator.  Hats off to all the hardworking staff.  Also, it was my sisters birthday when we checked in. She got two birthday cakes.  From Club 55 plus a birthday song, then another one delivered to our room.   Room service was great, the operator was nice and food delivered faster than the committed time.   Infinity pool is a sight to behold. The food at Club55 (unlimited drink cocktails, afternoon tea and canapes) were great. The view was breathtaking. Spagoo breakfast was delicious.  The room is so spacious with complete premium toiletries,  very comfortable bed and nice garden…",5,April 2019,
Our favourite hotel in the world,Caribbeanfans4,"As seasoned travellers we have visited many hotels but was totally blown away by the Singapore warm welcome and this amazing hotel. On arrival our hotel voucher was checked and we were sent down to another quieter check in desk - at tower 3. We stayed on the 7th floor which you would think isn’t too high, it was definitely high enough to see the gardens of the bay every day from your window! The rooms are amazing - automatic opening of the curtains when you enter the room, bottles of water every day and very well cleaned, The higher the floor you go the more expensive to stay but I would definitely stay this floor again. Lifts were efficient (only to be expected) and you got up to the pool very quickly (short change of lifts on the 34th floor) . Needing your room card - one for…",5,,
Nice,israr mansuri,One of the best hotel in the world is Marina bay sands hotel is located in Singapore bay and its look like boat great hotel nice food nice hotel and I love it my dream come true it was lovely atmosphere,5,April 2019,
Wow factor architecture but not a place for non smokers,ElevenMadison,"Yes, this place looks amazing, the architecture is stunning, it is the symbol of Singapore. Our suite was incredible complete with pool table cloakroom and full bathroom. Housekeeping was excellent, the toiletries luxurious and were generously replenished throughout our stay. The service levels in general is good, butler service is awesome. The treats left in the room each night for both adults and children alike are overly generous and really made my little ones holiday. The views from the roof top swimming pool pool are a selfie takers dream ........ if you can get to the edge for all the other selfie takers that is. Forget getting a recliner, that is a nigh on impossibility.  The club lounge is good but the policy of charging for children under 10 years old needs reviewing. …",3,April 2019,
Where you should stay while in Singapore!,Yam travels,This hotel is an amazing exterior and our room was fabulous with a great city view.The infinitely pool and the shopping area was my favourite .The stuff was so professional and kind. I will definitely be staying at this hotel on my next trip to Singapore .,5,January 2019,
Staffs are expecting to be tipped now?,Crystalism,"Stayed here many many times but this time it was the most unpleasant one. The staff who sent out extra bed stood there expecting to be tipped and refused to leave. After a while of ignoring him he left.  Anyway leaving a review here wouldn’t make a diff anyway as their management team will only copy paste a standard reply to everyone as this hotel is way too commercialised compared to when they first launched it.  Not my choice of hotel but since family wants I’ll follow. Otherwise I would pick Marriott Group hotels anytime over MBS’s commercialise, full of tourists, so busy, bad internet and nobody really cares about you. Service is certainly not 5 stars - hotel is so big seriously nobody knows you. ",2,January 2019,
Amazing place a must in Singapore,Sandra V,Amazing place a must in Singapore. Fantastic architecture and interior design. Great restaurants and bars. There is a Casino inside. Connected to the park and in front of the mall. Attentive service. Very well connected.,5,March 2019,
WOW,Liza Iveth N,"Stayed at Marina Bay Sands for a couple of nights, what a treat!!! Upon check in the attendant upgraded us to the 36th floor with garden view.  We were able to watch the light show from the comfort of our room :-).   The pool area which only hotel guests are allowed in is beyond words.  Worth every penny spent.",5,April 2019,
Just a Hotel,Kitchens A,"Place was good with a-lot of activity inside marina bay good for shopping and casino , eating out Very good i do recommend,   but about the Hotel i feel so so compared to Ritz Carton and price more expensive than other place   ",3,April 2019,
Well worth the expense!,rubinaak,"My husband and I were spending a few days in Singapore and having heard wonderful things about this iconic hotel, we decided to break our budget and book a one night stay (it’s not cheap, I tell you!).  Was it worth the money? ABSOLUTELY! We arrived at Tower 1 at around 10am. Check in is usually around 3pm but the front desk were very friendly and kindly allowed us to have an early check in without further cost.  We booked a garden bay view room and it absolutely lived up to its name! The view from the balcony was amazing! We could see the towering Supergrove Trees and a beautiful view of Singapore.   The room itself was above average. Spacious, comfortable bed and a huge stand alone tub.  However, the main attraction of the hotel HAS to be the Infinity Pool. As we had only…",5,April 2019,
Amazing Experience,X6022ME,"Room 1909 We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands, on the 18th April 2019, for 1 night It was amazing. We were greeted by the porter upon arrival, check in with Wati, who was very professional. We went to our room, of which was spotless, lovely interior a lovely balcony. At 7:30pm we had a knock at the door, to my surprise a Birthday cake was delivered, as it's my Birthday this month. We then visited the infinity pool, located on the 57 floor, wow wow, what a experience, can view Singapore 180 degrees. We absolutley loved the hotel, . We also found a food court, where we could sample the local foods. I have been in the catering industry for over 19 years, and have never experienced such, passionate team of staff, it was a delight. I will be returning.",5,April 2019,
"Not 5 star in any category, but a good prank",Kex007,"I will try to cut this short. Me and my husband have been to many nice places, hotels in all price categories. We wanted to start off our honeymoon with this supposedly hotel, then move on to Indonesia but unfortunately got disappointed as soon as we had checked in. They gave us not the bay view room we paid for, repeatedly they tried to tell us that garden view was bay view but could not respond to our question where the difference in price came to be. We are currently waiting at the front desk and nobody wants to help, either they say nobody is there or available at the moment. Sorry, but taking somebody’s money and not giving them what they bought and not being willing to return the money is fraud, no matter how nice you say it or how much you apologize. Terrible experience,…",1,April 2019,
WOW....What a hotel.....you just need to stay here when visiting Singapore,Rune V,"This hotel has everything!! The landmark of Singapore.....everything is so well organized from the check in to check out....recommend club room....then you have your own VIP check in room with leather seats and drinks, and the rooms are better and you have your own free club Lounge where you can eat and drink as much as you want.....and the swimming pool at the roof is just so amazing and spectacular.....and you have to try the restaurant and bar on the top.....soooo nice in the evening.....have fun",5,June 2018,
Staycation,Ronson Ang aka MR R,"Checking in again after 4 months , chose a garden view premier room. Got a 9th floor with great view. However need to change lift in order to get to the pool. As Low floor does not direct access to the pool. Compare to my previous stay at the city view room. Garden view room felt more warm due to the sun. But for smoker garden view room will be a better choice as you can smoke in the balcony. Overall experience still great.",5,April 2019,
Marina Bay 'Sands of Time',Good taste is it’s own reward,"My first stay several years ago was very impressive, but nothing has changed. Our room in tower 3 was average at best, hard bed and queen size at best. The poolside, thread bare towels and way too crowded. Time for new experiences in Singapore.",3,April 2019,
Club level definitely worth it.,Travelforfun717,The convenience and quality of the Club55 experience was worth the added cost of the Club level room. Room was very spacious and quite luxurious. Exceeded our very high expectations. Definitely recommend city view.,5,April 2019,
"Impressive, but not for everyone!",Dishie,"The views are fabulous, rooms are spacious, and the staff is friendly and helpful. If you like an enormously large Las Vegas style hotel, with very high end shops and a casino, you might enjoy staying here. However, be prepared for hordes of people (there are around 2500 rooms in three towers); and forget about actually swimming in the rooftop pool!  The restaurants in the hotel and the shopping complex are over-priced, so best to check out the many other choices in Singapore.",3,April 2019,
Exceeds all expectations!,Sue,This is definitely NOT the cheapest hotel I've ever stayed in but it maybe the most spectacular one. It towers over the bay in Singapore and looks amazing. The infinity pool is without a doubt the best thing about this hotel and is worth a visit during the day and also at night. We stayed for a week and were still finding new areas to explore. There's also an MRT station (Bayfront) underneath the Marina Bay Shopping Mall which makes getting around the city really easy. Hopefully I'll be able to afford to go back someday.,5,April 2019,
What more can one say?,ravegan,Believe the hype. Close to so many attractions and attached to the shopping mall and casino. Our room was large and comfortable with amazing views. When ordering room service breakfast please note that they give you huge portions enough for an army. The pool is worth the price and lives up to the hype. We were lucky and got to checkin early. Our bags made it quickly to our room and checkin was a breeze.,5,April 2019,
Final Night in Singapore,Ollie C,"After six and a half years, we arrived at our final night in Singapore. We knew the perfect destination - Marina Bay Sands. As usual, amazing pool, amazing staff and an amazing room. Facilities were great and just overall perfect.",5,April 2019,
Absolutely amazing,Ali,"I can't find anything wrong with my stay. The hotel was amazing, the pool was unreal and staff were on point. The 24 gym amazing, rooftop bars and shopping. Everything you need this hotel has it. My room was on the 32rd floor with city view in tower 2 and we had the best view of the city sky and light show.",5,April 2019,
Best place!,Krum S,"This is one of the most amazing places we have ever been! If you visit Singapore, it would be a mistake not to visit and definitely stay at the hotel! The rooftop pool and bars are amazing! The view is breath taking - just watch some YouTube videos. I definitely recommend it!",5,April 2019,
A must do in Singapore,Kerry S,We went for a tea time drink on the roof top bar and watched the amazing balmy day turn to night. Beautiful view and setting.   You pay an entrance fee of about S$45 however you redeem this against your drinks (if you remember... unlike us who had to get more drinks to use the voucher!)   View out the back of the Botanic Gardens too.,5,April 2019,
Incredible !!!,Maria P,... stayed in iconic Marina Bay Sands x 1 night during our 2 nights/3 days trip and WOW !....the night before we bought evening Singapore tour including light/music show in Gardens by the Bay and went for a night cruise around the bay...the next day we changed the hotel for MBS (they checked us in before check in time and the room is huge )...at lunch time we took self driving shuttle (5$ ) from to MBS to Gardens by the Bay (GBB) where we spent x 4 hours ...went to Sky walk and then for 15 min. guided tour around Gardens and the rest we spent in Flower Dome and Cloud Forest...fantastic !!!..at 6p.m. I headed to the world famous Infinity pool (must be a hotel guest to enter) for a swim and unforgetable sunset  over the spectacular Singapore skyline..at 8 p.m. I watched again the…,5,March 2019,
Great Hotel!,FredRoub,"Fantastic hotel, if you can, book this one for your stay in Singapore! Awesome roof top breakfast at the infinity pool! Impressive sight, great service. Lots of things to do in walking distance; Garden by the Bay etc.",5,October 2018,
A Titanic of a hotel,BluebellChloe,Stayed here for 2 nights and were very lucky to be upgraded to a whopping suite. So huge we lost the 3 kids. We felt very privileged to stay in such an enormous suite with a jaw dropping view of the bay. It was fun and reminded me of Las Vegas hotels. This type of hotel would not be top of my list normally but I think it’s got to be done if like we were visiting Singapore for the first time.,5,April 2019,
Convenient location and highly recommend for a family holiday to Singapore 🇸🇬,wendygray2018,"Although expensive, we would highly recommend that staying at MBS is worthwhile. We had two rooms for the 4 of us (children 11 and 14 years), on 35th floor, overlooking the city and Marina Bay. Huge and spacious. Excellent amenities. Stunning views, and had a beautiful view of the Spectra light show, from our rooms. Excellent location - within easy walking distance to Marina Bay, Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, and even Chinatown. A treat to swim in the rooftop pool (although VERY crowded and popular), and views in both directions (towards the city, and over the Gardens) were spectacular. The highlight of our 5 night stay was waking at 7am one morning and going for a peaceful, relatively cool walk through Gardens by the Bay and watching the sunrise.",5,April 2019,
Only the light show,Sherley,Again very beautiful at night the organization behind the show with all the light dancing in the front parade. My son had only seen n heard of the Merlion on YouTube videos prior to our visit imagine his happiness when he could actually take a pic like on YouTube 😉,4,November 2018,
Unique Experience,Samuditha Ishan,"We went there for our honeymoon & stayed there at a club room. One thing that I should highlight is we could be able to Marina Bay light show very clearly from the room itself when you select a club room. Foods are so delicious with the access to the club55 restaurant. Unique experience at the famous Infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands. It doesn't feel like a very high end luxury hotel comparing with its price, but its a very good unique experience. Overall experience is very good.",5,May 2018,
Put this on your bucket list - its a must! Worth it just for the pool,jbzonda,"First word that comes to mind? WOW! Marina Bay Sands is one of a kind in all aspects. Its such a unique structure in the lobby, its an instant icon. Checkin was even a great experience! Icecream upon arrival - how good is that! I tell you now, when you first enter the room its a OMG moment, i wont ruin it for you, but its pretty spectacular. Ultimately most people stay for 1 thing - that pool. Yup, the skypark pool is out of this world, and above it! Its a must do in Singapore. We splurged on poolside food and drinks for lunch and was a wonderful experience, we returned to the pool for sunset and it was a moment to savour. You HAVE to stay 1 night here in your life. The rooms are beautiful and well fitted out, luxurious. True 5 star.",5,April 2019,
Talk about a Pool with a View....,Valerie Gawn,"Arriving to check in at Marina Bay Sands almost feels like an Airport....it is so enormous!! Check in was smooth and quick, and our room was simply fabulous!! We had a Garden View... which allowed us to watch the nightly Light Show from our balcony! The room was huge...very modern, spacious, clean and minimalist in decor...so restful!! Each evening, our towels were folded into intricate animal shapes...amazing!! We didn't book breakfast, but there are so many top end shops...cafes...street food...bistros ...that there was no need! The complex houses 3 giant Towers, an enormous Casino, lots of shops...and even a canal and gondola to get around the site!! The star of the show is the rooftop Pool, spanning all 3 Towers on the 57th floor! Watching the sun set over Singapore,…",5,April 2019,
Amazing place to visit,odette P,"I wason my own  and had a really lovely time there , the water , the sculptures . great place to go for both adults and children  either during the day or at night when the lights are really spectacular . I ate really good chinese food and walked along the waterside just taking it all in ..  ",5,May 2018,
Once in a lifetime,Kate Andrews,"I attended a conference in the Marina Bay Sands complex, and stayed at the hotel for four nights. I can't fault the room, or any of the amenities – it truly is a wonder.  The only problem with a hotel of this scale is that it's difficult for the service to be personal. The only time I had an interaction with a staff member that felt genuinely caring, it was immediately followed by him telling me his name and asking to be mentioned in a positive TripAdvisor review.  The infinity pool opens at 6am, and getting there as early as possible is well worth it. You get the pool almost to yourself, and watching the dawn from the roof is an experience you won't get anywhere else.",5,March 2019,
Amazing Second stay.,Jodie1179,"We first stayed at Marina Bay Sands not Long after it opened and to be honest although it was/is an amazing hotel the service let it down. Well NOT any more, we have just left after our second stay many years later and WOW !!! Amazing service in every venue. The rooms are immaculate with loads of space. We were disappointed to leave today ! One of the best stays in a hotel we have had !",5,April 2019,
Best hotel to stay in SG!,Nur Farhanah O,"Stayed in MBS for my fiance's bday a couple years back. Have always wanted to come back because it is literally the best hotel for a staycation. The room was spacious and had a nice city view overlooking the river. We went to the infinity pool and a tip, it looks even prettier at night 👌 we ordered room service for breakfast the next day and was so impressed that they delivered into the room, set up table and utensils all for us! Wow! 5 stars for sure. Never had a service like this before in other hotels.",5,May 2018,
Best Hotel in Singapore,Wazza,"although this Hotel isn't rated the best in Singapore, it is for me. I've been visiting Singapore for over 15 years on numerous occasions and in all the Hotels I've stayed in, this is by far the best. You can feel the luxury and beauty of this Hotel from the first time you see it. The rooms are spacious and I selected a view of Gardens on the Bay. What a stunning view but not as stunning as the night view you get when you swim in the worlds highest infinity pool, 57 Floors up. You have to see it to believe it. I could have stayed there looking at the view all night. Service is beyond reproach and it's run like a well oiled machine.",5,March 2019,
Experience once...,scotslawyer2014,There is very little you can fault. The infinity pool is a must see. The food offering is very good. Breakfasts were excellent. And yet for me it was just slightly missing the atmosphere and service one usually expects in a 5 Star hotel. Everything is huge and fantastic. Personally the sheer size means the service not quite up there with say a Shangri-La or Conrad. Worth experiencing though given possibly best location.,4,April 2019,
The perfect stay,Mounir B,"The hotel stands out. We took a high floor king suite over looking the gardens and the port. The hotel has an enormous shopping mall, a casino, a unique pool on the top roof over looking Singapore. Perfect bed confort, spacious room. They have one of the best light shows infront of the shopping mall, access to the gardens as well.",5,November 2018,
Denied table,David W,"Despite being appropriately dressed in polo shorts long pants and shoes, and being guests in the hotel we were denied a table at the Italian restaurant. Not acceptable way to treat hotel guests. Hotel nice but huge and very impersonal",1,April 2019,
Dirty pool,TJoo,"This isn't a infinity pool! This is just a rooftop Jacuzzi near to the edge.  I have no problem with the room. It's good. Besides how cheapskate they wanted to ask for charges (or deposit, I forgot) for the bar fridge. Hello your hotel room isn't cheap okay.  The worst was the rooftop Jacuzzi (that they called it infinity pool) that has crockcoach at the drain besides! I complained to the staff and they replied me ""it is okay what. Not inside the pool"" Hello? So you want me to enjoy the view of your dirty drain? And from where the crockcoach came from? If not from the 'pool' itself. ",2,December 2018,
57th floor,What a journey it has been,The best of Singapore MBS! the pool was pack of guest!well..I guess you gotta experienced the highest pool!  The food was lovely and walking distance to the casino and shops! not the best for shopping its a bit expensive..,4,September 2018,
Me and many,Aussiebeccyc,"Marina Sands Hotel is structurally impressive, however you are one of 1000s there. The rooms are overpriced compared to other 5 star hotels around the world.  Great view of the bay, lovely staff, and very good accommodation compared to other hotels in Singapore. The infinity pool is incredible but you are there with 100s of others...so not relaxing! Disappointing that use of pool and breakfast is not included in expensive room rates. All that said would I stay there again...most likely! ",4,April 2019,
Superb,Reg Date,"One of the worlds top hotels imo. Immaculate rooms, conscientious staff who are keen to help. Just a pleasure to stay. Lots to do, the restaurants always have fresh food and the choice is amazing - American, Italian, modern Asian.",5,April 2019,
Enjoyed my stay,Flo,"World famous hotel , unique design, next to garden by the Bay  Many high end designer boutique and restaurant , casino at the lower level  convenient , public train MRT is next to hotel . Good service, rooms are spacious with full toiletries. Enjoyed my stay .",5,April 2019,
"Stunning place, but impersonal",Stephen B,The room was good and very comfortable and so it should be at S$615 a night! The infinity pool and views are spectacular. We stayed three nights and were there especially to celebrate a 50th birthday - no acknowledgement nor good wishes given. I can't help feel that it would be better to stay at another hotel across the way and be able to look at this incredible building rather than stay in it!,3,January 2019,
"As welcoming as an airport terminal, overpriced and under delivers",outoftok,"I was excited to be staying at MBS on my last visit to Singapore. On arrival I was surprised at the check in queue and check in experience. Felt like an airport terminal, no attempt is made to make you feel welcome or special. Then you traipse with your bags 100s of metres to your tower, get accosted by security guards making sure you’re a guest and not a tourist. The elevators were packed with guests going up to the rooftop pool so it takes ages, stopping at most floors in the high rise lift.  The room was pretty good and the curtains open on arrival to showcase the amazing views. Bathroom was not 5 star, the ceiling had peeling paint and was patched.  The rooftop pool area was packed and the pool was full of guests with selfie sticks. Too many people in it to make it appealing…",3,March 2019,
wow,Rosie8855,"wow what a place so clean lots of interesting places to see,and the lightshows at night are brilliant we loved singapore people very helpful as well ,great shopping mall with designer shops in .the only thing we couldnt understand that in such a cosmopolitan the only currency they took was singapore dollars we had euros and usa dollars and had to keep finding exchange bureaus ",4,February 2019,
Amazing hotel,Carthagean,This is the most prestigious hotel in Singapore. It has the well know MBS top deck overlooking all Singapore as well as the famous seathrough borderless swimming pool on top floor which is amazing. The hotel is full of glamorous decorations and huge vases. It is connected to a casino and a luxurious shopping mall. Also connected to the famous Marina Bay Gardens,5,April 2019,
A minimum “must stay once” in your life,kbardh,"A few billion $ of construction spent on this amazing three imposing tower blocks with a magnificent view of the city skyline on one side and Gardens By The Bay on the opposite side, makes for one of the most memorable stays in Singapore. Pay a bit more and stay in the Premier rooms on the higher floors which gives you this million dollar view from your balcony.   An absolute must is a swim in their infinity pool overlooking the beautiful Marina Bay and Central Business District skyline. Better to swim evening time when you see the different shades and colours of the sky. Restaurants there are of high quality and great to celebrate a special occasion. My favourite restaurant Osteria is now gone so will need a new favourite.   What’s great about staying here is that the metro…",5,April 2019,
Nice but too crowded,Kevin M,"The room was nice, the pool was nice, the breakfast was nice but at any given time you felt like being at Mumbai or Shanghai main train station during rush hour. My recommendation go for dinner/drink on the roof top and save your money for a less crowded 5 star hotel",3,April 2019,
"Stunning building, enjoyed our stay, but something of novelty value",Robert G,"27 wedding anniversary special treat 4 night stay at the Marina Bay Sands. Premier room, harbour view. Queue for check-in was ridiculous, but saved by a gentleman that ushered us to the VIP check-in area...phew as we might not have got into the room for another hour. It reminded me of queueing up for rides at a theme park....bit of a shame that, I feel.  Room was located on 43rd floor and was great to have the gardens and harbour view and, a small balcony upon which there was room to stand. As far as the room goes and, compared to other hotels that are not nearly quite so “grand” it was okay, not “wow” or fabulous. The bath robes were pretty ordinary, as were the bath towels; then and small. There was tea and coffee facilities and a mini bar that charged upon removal; had those…",3,April 2019,
impressive hotel but like a railway station,Erik B,arrived at airport with a pick up at the gate and limousine Service - very nice.  Check-in in suite was easy and well organised - the suite in tower 3 level 46 very nice and spacious and clean with nice views to The Gardens and the water.  We had a good in-room dining the first evening due to late arrival - service was good and food was tasty.  Breaksfast at RISE was from the food point of view ok - but several hundreds of guests without any athmosphere - a continual comming and going - a mass processing.  the hotel itself impressive from the architecture but at ground level busy like a Railway Station  One evening we wanted to dine at LAVO on Skypark in tower1.

Fab hotel,samcI2668AP,"We stayed here for two nights in a club king room with a city view. We were given a room on the 39th floor, we found the room to be spacious with a comfy bed and nice bathroom.   Check in was quick and easy in the Sands Lounge at Tower 1, we were even able to check in early at no extra cost, which was great after a long haul flight.  We went to club 55 several times during our stay for both breakfast and drinks with canapés. The food and drinks were very good with lots of choice, service was excellent from all servers. We found this to be worth the extra room cost.  We enjoyed using the roof top pool and hot tubs three times during our stay, we were always able to get a sunbed.

Good Stay but Know What to Expect.,Anthony A,"The hotel architecturally is beautiful. The pool is amazing. View of the gardens are great. If this is why you are going then you will have no issue. First off, this is a BIG hotel with so many guest. It is similar to a Vegas hotel and it has that Vegas feel (without the tackiness of course). If that is not what you are looking for then this isn't the place for you. The rooms were comfortable and view was amazing, we were able to see the lights from the Gardens from our balcony The location cant be beat. You can walk directly to the Singapore Bay Gardens. I was not impressed with the design of the rooms. They were very bland and not logical. Kind of disappointing when you see how beautiful the rest of the building is. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you want to do the…",4,April 2019,
Ok the view but...,Zeela,"The hotel is HUMONGOUS, Las Vegas style, not specially charming and yes you come here for the view. Yes the view is great. Rooms are large. But that's about it. Pool is certainly spectacular but overcrowed.  There are plenty other charming hotels in SG to discover.",3,December 2018,
largest infinity pool in the world,Patrick M,"A must do destination,3 huge towers and then the roof top pool, wow what a place to go. Food ok but it is a well placed hotel by the gardens, light show with operatic music, Totally dramatic. Its simply iconic and you would not regret this hotel ever.",5,December 2018,
Enriching experience in a great city,ShockedRuben,"This hotel has all you ever dreamed off. Ignore the angry housewives in the reviews. The staff is kind and everybody takes time for a chat. Of course they are super polite which makes you feel like a VIP :-)  The hotel is an icon, the pool is amazing, the food is great. Also the jacuzzis facing the queue of mega ships at the harbour are an endless joy.  We stayed one night, make sure to check in on time to explore everything. It was a real highlight on our 4 weeks trip through Malaysia and Singapore.",5,April 2019,
Inadequate beds,Kylie K,"Booked for a family of four and was given a room with 2 single beds.   Way overpriced for what you get.  The whole place is like a human zoo.  Too many people not enough staff and an American service attitude that does not work in Asia.  There is nothing here beside the pool, it is amazing but not worth the money they charge to stay for a night.  Save your money spend half as much on a better hotel somewhere else, and google pictures of the pool and you will have a much better stay in Singapore. You will also really enjoy Asian hospitality, not some gordy peice of Las Vegas dropped in the middle of Singapore.",1,April 2019,
Highly Recommend,meimika55,"My check in experience was great. Jenna,  the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very nice with the garden view. The infinity pool was nice with breathtaking view. The hotel is conveniently located across the street from the shopping mall, food court, artscience museum & the garden. The hotel is close to the airport about 20 minutes drive. I will definitely book this wonderful hotel again in the near future!",5,April 2019,
Marina Bay Sands,29hanonm,For spring break I went to Marina Bay Sands. It was beautiful and fantastic. I swam in the pool and saw a wonderful view from the pool. Managers were so helpful and kind! The food was excellent. The rice was delicious. I had fun and amazing time. Now go! Have same fun at the pool and enjoy the delicious meal in Marina Bay Sands.,5,March 2019,
Like a dream!!,xmarlem,"We have been there in Singapore in February and spent a couple of days (more than 600 dollars per night) at the Marina Bay Sands. A quick check-in and straight to the top. The infinity pool is truly the most spectacular in the world. We enjoyed a lot!!! The view from there is breathtaking and there are also two jacuzzi where you can relax. Unbelievable!! We really appreciated that :)  Rooms seemed much nice than I had expected. We had a large apartment with a living room, two bathrooms and a bedroom. The view was on the Gardens by the bay and was amazing, especially in the evening. By the way, next to the hotel there is a fantastic mall, accessible directly from the hall.  I suggest to spend at least a day chilling out at the top if you want to live one of the best experience in…",5,February 2019,
Amazing!!!!,lovebeingtan,"Everything about my experience was fantastic!  From the ease of checking in, to the friendly and prompt service received throughout our stay I highly recommend this hotel.  The room was very clean and spacious.  The bathroom was modern and inviting....actually the first hotel tub I would think about bathing in :)   Within the building, there are lots of high end shops and the food court is also rather decent, although there are lots of the same type of options, the food was good.  Also access to the Gardens by the Bay connected to hotel by a walking bridge.  But lets be real, the rooftop pool is EVERYTHING!  The view is stunning and well worth the time spent in and around.  Again, the service was on point.",5,April 2019,
Breath Taking and Amazing!!!!!!,MARKEITH69,"I have wanted to stay here for many years and now we have finally achieved it and it was worth the wait. OMG this hotel was amazing in every way, we had a room on the 46th floor with views of the marina and light show at night which was at 8pm and 9pm .Don't forget the even more spectacular light show in the gardens with the huge multi coloured trumpets it was awesome.This show was at 7.45pm and 8.45 pm. The rooms were wonderful in every respect decor comfort and cleanliness and the service second to none. We had dinner and breakfast in the hotel lobby restaurant which although expensive was very very nice indeed. But for us the best experience this hotel has to offer is the spectacular roof top infinity pool and gardens WOW WOW WOW !!!!!! amazing, awesome, spectacular,…",5,April 2019,
Amazing service!,Katherine_Caballero_,"Since we get into the hotel a gentleman approached us asking if he can take us to another counter and it was the vip lounge.  Since we get there Xiaofan was so lovely!  She was so polite and helpful.  We stayed there for my boyfriend’s birthday and we booked for a deluxe room but since she knew it was his bday she checked and gave us a free upgrade to a club room with the garden view!  We got into the room and was so spacious, clean and with an spectacular view!   We got some drinks at the pool which was soooo crowded that we didn’t really enjoyed but was not hotel fault at all but they should have at least an adults only time because was full of kids and some of us we just want to relax.

Amazing roof top infinity pool,Leventmert,"We had a one night stopover in this hotel. Great location access to many amenities in hotel and surrounding attractions. Like casino, mall, gardens by the bat, bay light show etc.   But amongst all the best experience was the roof top infinity pool.   Recommend to check booking from the hotel website, which was the best value at the time I booked.   ",5,April 2019,
Hotel only with breathtaking view,Naziha Ibrahim,I stayed there for 3 times already. First stay was bad experience in 2014 where the concierge misplaced our luggage. next stay was in 2015 for a week which we did not encounter any issue. Third stay was in 2017 only for a night. The reason I keep on coming back is for the sake of the view and the infinity pool. Hotel is huge and massive which we don;t really feel personalized.,5,May 2018,
Expensive but worth it,sunset34439,"It's like the main attraction in Singapore. The 3 towers with rootop pool and entertaining area. Actually where part of where 'crazy Rich Asian' film. Great amenities, definitely worth the price for a few days'stay",5,November 2018,
Why you should visit Marina Bay Sands Singapore,29Juliap,"For spring break I went to Marina Bay Sands Singapore. It has an amazing restaurant with excellent food especially the Sushi plus it has 2,500 bedrooms in the hotell! The pool is huge and the view is so beautiful at night. Firstly it was expensive and I mean really REALLY expensive. I bought some Fanta for my Sister Emma, Sprite for my Brother Philip and a Coke for myself! It’s very luxury. It’s very Enormous like really really gigantic. Secondly it’s Miraculous and it is unbelievable. You should really go there I highly recommend it! Just saying so that you won’t miss the fun and the light show!!",5,April 2019,
Amazing stay at this hotel,CHMerry,"We stayed for one night, but wished it could have been for longer. From the moment you step inside, it is a wonderful experience. Friendly and helpful staff at the check in and our room was ready before the 3pm check in time. We were excited to use the pool so we headed there early afternoon and it wasn’t too busy (was a Monday) and managed to get some sun beds at the side of the pool. The view from the top is breathtaking and I couldn’t stop looking at it. We saw both light shows (gardens by the bay at the 7:45pm and just in front of the shopping centre at 9pm). Both are really worth watching and we managed to fit in some lovely food at the food court in the shopping mall in between - delicious and reasonably priced. And just as well we fitted in a trip to the gym at the hotel…",5,April 2019,
Stayed for 2 nights,JLOCLEOFE,"Our second time here. Room was spacious and has a lovely view. Pool was lovely too. Though it looks spotlessly clean, found a strand of hair and rubber band at the shower room which I believe it wasn’t thoroughly  clean. Beddings and towels were spotlessly white and smelled fresh. Most of the staffs we have encountered and met were friendly and accommodating. Still our top favourite hotel when in SG. ",5,April 2019,

My Top pick in Asia. Excellent hotel,Anil S,"This is my top pick in Asia.  Very clean, well organized hotel. Rooms are very clean and excellent. Room service etc is probably one of the best.  All the restaurants are fantastic.  Try spa go's. Check in and checkout and the bell guys are very well trained. The location is very good as the metro is there and the largest high end mall.  The casino is very good too.  Some really good restaurants in the mall too.",5,April 2019,
Singapore Conference,petersS3768XA,"A perfect location to stay for any conference at the centre across the road. Easy access to the centre, shopping & metro without going outside in the heat or rain.

Lots of restaurants to chose from in the hotel & attached shopping centre. ",5,April 2019,
Beautiful place!,KC R.,"We stayed here for one night on our 3 day trip to Singapore and it was great! We arrived early, unfortunately our room wasnt ready yet, but they have a luggage service where the send luggages to your room when the room is ready. The pool is only accessible to hotel guests, and we went around sunset-night and it was not that crowded. The hotel is attached to a mall with high end shops, very accessible. We stayed at Tower 3 and had a beautiful view of Gardens by the Bay, where we were able to watch the show! Also, there is an AMAZING light show at the mall which I highly recommend, it's free and pretty long! To top things off, my boyfriend and I enjoyed room service and the food was pretty delicious with a great view! What a great relaxing stay at Marina Bay Sands :) Glad for the…",5,March 2019,
Perfect view,anju_10,"We visited this place during our recent trip.The view was worth.If you are going in the Singapore flyer , you  can avoid it. View is similar.We went around 5pm and it was really hot. There is a restaurant which serves limited menu with skyrocketed prices.I would suggest you go little late, so you can spend little more time there.",4,April 2019,
Brilliant,kkkaur,There is so much to do in this vicinity and the hotel is beautiful. I do have to say that i have stayed in better but given Singapore i think this is of a high standard for them. The pool was brilliant. Great views and not over crowded. Great shopping centre and you must do the light shows and the water laser show. Only downfall is they don't do enough shows! Other thing is everything is very far apart and not great signage around the location therefore you get lost trying to locate things.  For example when we wanted to go to Gardens by the Bay we asked and we were told a long way round when in fact you can go through the hotel itself. You can use your keycard to get discount at the shopping centre which isn't really made obvious.  Also keep your receipts for a tex refund at…,5,April 2019,
Marina Bay Sands,Jan-ice T,This hotel is truly magnificent. From the check in to check out the staff were wonderful . The room we had was fabulous with a veiw to die for overlooking the bay .

Mother and daughter break.,Tanyamp4870 P,"My daughter and i stayed for 4 nights. Expensive? Yes but it was our choice to stay at the hotel and pleased that accommodation was paid in full a few months ago. Our room was on the 26th floor facing the beautiful gardens. The room was immaculate! Can not fault the cleanliness of the room and the professionalism of the house-keeping team who are always an asset to any organisation. The lifts: too slow!! I agree with what sonebody else who wrote in their review that there should be guest only lifts. Lets face it, the infinity pool on the 57th floor is the main attraction and probably the main drawcard. I thoroughly enjoyed the adults only section of the pool so thank you very much to the lifeguards for keeping the pesky kids out of this small area of a large pool. Will i be…",4,April 2019,

Anniversary champagne,stevebt15,"March 29, 2019. Wedding anniversary, 11 years, for my husband and I. Enquired with concierge to see if we were appropriately dressed (in cargo shorts, tee shirt and loafers) to go up to the 57th floor for a glass of champagne and to admire the view. Advised that a slightly more formal dress code is imposed, every evening, post 7pm. Lobby seemed crazy/manic. Some very pretentious persons trying to make themselves look big or important, at the expense of the really polite and hard working front of house and reception team. Don’t they realise how false and pathetic they make themselves look?? The staff definitely had the upper hand and kept their cool.  Got crammed into a lift heading for floor 57. Certain nationalities trying to shout and scream louder than the nationality next to…",4,March 2019,
"Too big, too busy",Ben S,"I have not been particularly impressed by this hotel.  Its biggest selling point is the view from the 57th floor, which is very impressive.  However, beyond that, I find it difficult to enthuse about it.  It has over 2,500 rooms and this shows: the service is slow and impersonal.   The dining facilities are frankly not able to cope with the sheer number of guests.  There are queues for breakfast at 7.10 am.  Further, the check in and concierge feel as if they are located in a busy shopping mall.  Yet further, I am fed up with the lifts: every time I want to go up to my room, I have to compete with an army of tourists wanting to travel to the top.  They really ought to have lifts for hotel guests only.  My advice would be to stay at the Raffles and visit the MBS one evening for a…",3,April 2019,
ROOM GOOD BUT POOL NEEDS GUIDELINES,Fabiolacavera,"I hag a great room but with disappointment the pool was full o screaming children, of noisy instagramers, of people who were not behaving properly! The Management should approve a strict code of behavior for clients, otherwise it is an amusement park , not a luxury Hotel. No one did the room night set.",3,April 2019,
Great experience,Amanda,"First of all, i was travelling with a backpack so i assumed there might be a little staring and a not so warm welcome as it had happened before in other luxury hotels when arriving with a backpack, but for my surprise it was everything else. Staff was very friendly and welcoming even though we didn't look like the average customer there. Got to check-in early, had a nice room from the 26th floor with a garden view. Floor was silent, not any noises from the corridor or other rooms. Have to recommend the garden view, you get to see amazing sunrises and Garden by the bays supertree light show from your own balcony! Room itself was very good and clean with comfortable beds and even more comfortable pillows and linens. Curtains and lights can be controlled from bed. Good quality…",4,March 2019,
JUST PLAIN EXTRAORDINARY!,Bonnie J,"This hotel is architecturally thrilling, designed by Moshe Safti - he did not disappoint! The view of the Bay is stunning, the horizon edge pool that floats between all three towers on the 57th floor is worth the price of admission.  Ask for a room between the 8th floor and the 25th floor to maximize your viewing excitement.  Rooms are gracious, food in their many restaurants is great.  I recommend Spagos for breakfast (included in the American Plan) and whatever you do  . . .  don't miss the 22 layer chocolate/Peanut butter cake in Lavo lounge near the pool.  Be sure to take in the light show in the sculpture gardens and the water show in the harbor - both are free and spectacular.  This was just plain FUN!",5,February 2019,

pool with a view !,ian m,this is the go to hotel in Singapore apparently and everyone wants one of the iconic shots of themselves in the roof top pool. However this is a very large hotel with a huge number of guests and although the service is good do not expect five star service and if you want a decent room on a high floor it is worth paying for a club room.The pool is lovely but there are a lot of people enjoying it so it is not a place to go for splendid isolation. That being said the hotel is convenient for anything you might want and has an excellent choice of restaurants.,4,March 2019,

Once a year...,Ada F,"Attending conferences in Singapore and finding hotels within walking distance, I find myself staying at Marina Bay Sands once a year.   The spacious guest room commanded panoramic view of the sea. Here I really appreciate the craftsmanship of housekeeping who sculpted a rabbit from towels for display in guest rooms!  Upon checking in, I enquired the front desk staff if I could still find a power cable that I left in my room a year before. I must appreciate the helpful staff in searching through their database, found my name, and checked their relevant department. Though I can’t retrieve it since lost and found items would be disposed of within a limited period of time, the caring attitude of their staff is to be applauded.",5,September 2018,
Good Value for Your Money,FatOldDude,"At S$56 a head, the lunch buffet at Rise Restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel isn’t cheap, especially since it will go up to S$66 after the service charge and taxes.  However for that money, you do get a pretty wide variety of choices.  For sashimi lovers, the large chunks of tuna and octopus will make the price seem less daunting.  There are also stations dedicated to Indian and local Singaporean dishes. Unlike other hotels, the dessert spread is substantial, with a chocolate fountain and a make-your-own soda counter.  I am impressed with the buffet here, which says a lot.  Set under the wide expanse of the atrium glass of the hotel, a section of the restaurant will be bathed in light, a boon to sun worshippers. But for a photophobic local like me, I asked for a shaded…",4,April 2019,
A ghastly experience not worthy of the money,nw05250,"Ours was a 3 star hotel experience and make no mistake this is a MASSIVE hotel with more rooms than the Vatican. Arrived at check in at 6pm having been dropped off by our taxi driver at the Tower 3 entrance. Walking through the glass doors there were so many people in the foyer it was difficult discerning where the check in counter was. Having eventually found it, we were presented with 11 clerks behind 5 terminals. Despite this overwhelming ratio of staff-guest it took a good 13 minutes for our clerk to check us in. This was because he was struggling in his own words '' to find you a room''. Now if checkout is 11 pm, and we have arrived at 6 pm , having made a booking a month prior, surely someone somewhere would've already allocated a room. Appears not. The room that was…",2,April 2019,
Not impressed,NellasG,"Stayed over in the Premium room for the weekends with family. First of all, the lobby was really rowdy and likened “market place”.  The room was more spacious than many 5-star hotels. However the basic amenities like toiletries were “cheap” looking. The way drinks in the fridge are secured gave occupants a feeling that they couldn’t be trusted. The bed was really comfortable but the pillows were too soft.  Gym facility was well equipped and clean; the infinity pool was always busy and unpleasantly crowded. Food in and around the hotel are definitely pricey; can’t say the quality or variety (esp those restaurants at Level 1) were great.",3,March 2019,
Not Quaint but Amazing,ElGuru71,"Marina Bay Sands is a true feat of a hotel and an attraction in and of itself.  While it can be overwhelming and easy to feel anonymous, it is a great property. I opted to stay in a club room which was a good decision. Checking was in the Sands lounge rather than general check in. This was a pleasant space with small snacks and water (and you get to sit while waiting to check in). Also it provided access to Club55 in tower 2 which we used for afternoon tea and breakfast.   The room was large, clean and luxurious. The beds were comfortable and all of the soaps and lotions were from a luxury brand. We were lucky enough to be on the 53rd floor and had great views of Gardens by the Bay.   The pool is one of the primary reasons to stay here. The hotel really restricts access to the…",5,March 2019,

As a hotel, MBS has an excellent reputation, and all rooms are very well appointed. Service is as you'd expect from an establishment that markets itself as ""Asia's best 5-star Hotel"", and the arcitecture is fantastic too.  Excellent access everywhere, and a visit to MBS is incomplete without a trip around ""The Shoppes"" downstairs, the Gardens by the Bay (with their World-famous Supertrees), and a ride on the amazingly clean, graffiti-free and efficient Singapore Rapid Transit Subway system.

Like being in Las Vegas,Kevin M,"I visited in March 2019 for a Friday/Saturday nights stay. The scale of the hotel is enormous, with a huge lobby (both in square footage and atrium volume). I was checked in efficiently despite a long queue for the check-in area. My room had been booked directly on the hotel's website for a low-floor king-bed room. The room was ready when I arrived at 5 PM, and the room exceeded my expectations as far as square footage and finishes. The room was also very quiet, despite being on the 6th floor off of the indoor lobby atrium. The scale of the hotel plus the pool and observation deck atop it reminded me of being in Las Vegas.

So So Hotel,jenbrin,"I have to say our stay here was sadly disappointing and suppose to be the highlight of our 3 wk journey through Asia. The skypool is definitely worth a visit and lives up to the hype. However, our room was ok and fell a bit short for a 5 star hotel. Starting off with our first night our room made horrible loud banging noises throughout the night that kept us up. When we addressed to the staff even with a recording of it they dismissed as a nonissue. Only after we got maintenance up there did they move us rooms and still fully charged us for the first horrible night. As a hotel quite pricey they seem to treat our complaint as our problem not there's. Also beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable.

Our room looked over the Gardens by the Bay. Be aware this is a huge Hotel There were always lots of people wandering around the foyer. It made the check in a little slow but not too bad.  This was particularly an issue with the Club access on Friday and Saturday evenings access is from 5pm best not to be late or you face a longish wait. However the wait staff were lovely and seated us quickly whilst serving us champagne! A special mention to Leonard at Concirerge desk. He was great with directions to the gardens and the shops.

Food And Shopping,Vincent O,Nice food but way too expensive for the price you pay to have local food. Mostly meant for tourists with all the high luxury boutiques. Nothing is really cheap here except if you go Zara or the shops selling sporting goods like Adidas and World of Sports. Mostly meant to target the well to do locals and people who feel they are part of a upper social type. Be prepared to pay anything from $12 to $18 for a plate of Nasi Padang,4,February 2019,

Roof top bars are excellent, better breakfast in ‘rise’ really good. Really great service and some nice touches from the staff, always greeted by name when dialling room service etc.  I was in a ‘deluxe’ room which was the most basic, and while it had everything I needed, to be honest it was a bit tired, smaller than I expected, and had no view or balcony - I was looking over the shopping centre.

The light show was witnessed from the comfort of our own suite.  The hotel offers exciting shopping experience with brand names.  Just take the elevator, and you are there.

The Ultimate Hotel in Singapore,jamesbR5988GG,I have stayed many times at MBS and I never ceased to be amazed at the level of service and professionalism shown by the staff here.  When staying at MBS you must stay in a club room or higher to completely experience the qualities of the hotel and especially Club 55.  The staff there are amazing.  When my wife and I walked in the staff greeted us by name (and we hadn't been there for 9 months) asked how our children were etc.  Made you feel special.  The food at club 55 for breakfast is a mix of Asian and American and of the best quality.  The afternoon tea is excellent and then there is the canapés from 5 to 7.  Great food and excellent French Champagne and spirits.  I can not recommend this hotel and Club 55 highly enough.  This is the only hotel I stay at in Singapore and I…,5,March 2019,
Worth Every Penny,Ben Clark,"Let’s be straight - the price you have to pay to stay at MBS is more than you will pay at most hotels and will certainly be in my lifetime. However MBS is worth every penny!! From the movement you arrive, the service is second to none, the hotel is thriving with activity and offers options to suit all tastes.  We decided to pay for an Club room which made our stay even more enjoyable. The Club55 lounge is fantastic and really makes the money you spend worthwhile. We can’t remember any of the staff names however everyone was always welcoming and happy to help. The facilities at the hotel are world class, we took a trip to the casino which was seemless to enter and was a hive of activity inside.  It’s easy to get a taxi outside the hotel with the taxi stop having numerous cars…",5,March 2019,
WOW WOW WOW !!!,2201Tam,"We have had an amazing stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated as valued guests - and not a room number as I had thought possible before I arrived - as the Hotel and complex is so BIG! I could fault nothing - the staff were amazing, our room spotless and the view incredible, the Hotel is just Wow! We were staying over Chinese New Year and so were lucky enough to see all the festivities in Singapore. We can't wait to return -  this is really the place to be! Thank you - We  have returned with such wonderful memories! Tina, Paul and Jade",5,February 2019,
Mesmerising view,PARUL B,Its a good place to be and the view is awesome.The photograph taken is quiet expensive. WOrth spending time there for an hour. We spent approximately an hour it was a good experience to be there. Its worth going there once.,4,March 2019,
Got a huge free upgrade without even requesting!,saylar_c,"My family of 4 had booked 2 deluxe rooms for our little staycation in Singapore.  Upon check-in, when the woman realized we were a family of 4, she casually mentioned how she upgraded us to a suite with 2 bedrooms (without me asking).  I thanked her and proceeded to our room.  Wow!  For the price of 2 deluxe rooms, we ended up with a Straits Suite on the 54th floor!  No idea what we did as a family to deserve this, but we may never experience this level of luxury again.  Baby grand piano, karaoke room, the list goes on and on.  Over 5 times bigger in area than those 2 original rooms combined, and an even bigger upgrade in terms of room rate.  Thanks, MBS!  As for everything else you'd expect in a major luxury hotel, MBS has it!  Will not disappoint!",5,March 2019,
MBS rocks my world!,outnaboutgal123,"Marina Bay Sands is a splurge that does not disappoint! Singapore is on display and it’s eye popping! Go to Sweet Spot for your coffee and pastry!

The Jewel of Singapore,Ángel A,"I was in Singapore on business and had the luxury of staying at the Marina Bay Sands. From arrival to departure, this property laid out the Red Carpet. The entire staff were all overly eager to make my stay a memorable experience. I wasn’t disappointed. From Housekeeping, FD, Concierge, Security and outlets, they all make this property a destination of luxury.   I will be back next year as I believe  this location will be a yearly business destination.   Well done! ",5,March 2019,
Perfect ending after a two week cruise in Asia.,mduk1949,"We splurged on a suite and it exceeded my expectations.  We arrived around 11:00 a.m. having disembarked early from our cruise.  The concierge's desk directed us to an office behind the main registration desk of Tower 1.   We met with a VIP representative who offered us refreshments, had our luggage stored and told us they would contact us via e-mail when our room was ready.  A little after noon we were in our corner 17th floor suite, which had a garden main view and a partial city view from the bathroom.  The suite was enormous, with an equally large bathroom.

Short staycation,KV1972,"Spent couple of nights as a family staycation during the school break. Rooms are spacious with great views - either city view of harbour view. We stayed at level 23 in deluxe king city view room.  Positive - great views, unrestricted access to the infinity pool at level 57 and skypark observation deck, Great gym with fantastic views at level 55 with friendly staff. Plenty of dining options. Negative - 1) Shower facilities in room are bit basic considering how pricey the rooms are, 2) can be crowded at times especially during the peak holiday season which may dampen the roof top infinity pool experience. Best time to access are 6-8am or after 8pm  Overall it was a pleasant memorable stay. Avoid peak holiday season if you want enjoy the experience on one of world's best roof top…",4,March 2019,
Not worth the money for a long stay,alisonjudy,"The Marina Bay Sands has the crown jewel, in terms of pools, in Singapore, and maybe in the world. Of course, everyone is blown away by the pool - especially right after a 17hour flight from San Francisco!   However, the excitement starts to fizzle pretty quickly from there. The lengthy waits for the elevators, the million and ten tourists, it is generally far from everything except Gardens by the Bay, oh, and the uncomfortable beds. Service also was pretty lackluster - a 45+ min wait for drinks at the pool... then they delivered the wrong drinks, then charged me.   I would recommend that people go for the experience, leave after the first few days. Would not recommend a lengthy stay.",3,March 2019,
Lux experience,Mina Q,"We booked a room (just standard double deluxe) 2 days before our trip. I’ve searched from site to site and all are expensive.

How to get there:  By cab/grab : expensive probably 8-15sgd  By train: 👌🏻 (Better get the tourist pass- you can use it in mrt/lrt/bus) By bus: also good    But its better to get there through MRT(from my own experience)  Check in is at 3pm.

Never again...,Siegfried A,"The Hotel is spectacular, the structure unparalleled, but it is also most likely in the top 3 of visited Tourist attractions in Singapore and it seems everyone in SG is on the roof top. So, if you enjoy standing in line for your US$18 drink, can’t get a seat/table or love 30 minute elevator rides/waits, this is your place. I would have rated this 2 Star if it wasn’t for the staff from the gift shop who courierd a gift to me, I forgot to buy. If you book direct with them and pay the higher rate over the “booking.com(s)” you are promised lots of “cash”. Don’t believe it!!!! You are merely given discounts in their ridiculously priced restaurants and casino dollars, all 30 of them! Be aware! 3 nights was way too long and for that money you can stay at better hotels.

Iconic and gorgeous and so fun. Walking easy to the Gardens by the Bay (beyond beautiful and a cool break from my tropical sweating...) Rooftop Infiniti pool that is as good as you can imagine. Singapore Slings extraordinaire. Dinner at Lavo with a killer view of the Harbor (and the light show promptly at 8)! Stroll down to the Gardens for the free and amazing light show there (promptly at 845)! Then to the room for an amazing view as the jet lag takes over.   P.S.  For paranoid Americans like me...

This time, we stayed for a week as a treat, and were so sorry to leave. This is one of our best life experiences!",5,March 2019,
I expected more from the renowned marina bay sands,irmaSA,"The pool is magnificent... as expected, but the rest was a bit of a disappointment.  We booked a sky view room and stayed on the 50th floor... We expected to be wow'ed but the hotel room had a lot lacking.  The toilet could not flush properly, and even when one tissue is flushed it comes back.  The shower was old and the shower head clogged, the water sprayed in all the directions except for down where it's supposed to go. There were great things about the hotel as well but the room and bathroom is old and in need of a revamp.",3,March 2019,

The hotel's usual check-in time is 3 p.m. Since I was taking an early morning flight to Singapore, I had requested for an early check-in. The hotel was more than happy to accommodate my request. I appreciate such a hospitable attitude. I've travelled a fair bit and haven't come across too many hotels in South-East Asia who are willing to be so flexible with their check-in and check-out times.

Despite the fact that the hotel is enormous with thousands of guests checking in and out every day the service was exceptional. Our porter personally handled a room change within a few minutes of our arrival in a swift, seamless and genuinely friendly manner.   The highlight is of course the infinity pool and rooftop dining area- this is really bucket list stuff. It gets very busy in the day so I’d recommend going in the evening it’s a little quieter and the skyline looks way better when it’s all lit up.  Lavo serves contemporary Italian food with a large array of options and exquisite desserts. Make a reservation if you’d like to eat dinner at a reasonable time.

"Worth it for at least one night, then move on.",sww326,"A friend encouraged me to spend at least one night at MBS on my first visit to Singapore. Since she's one who normally swears-off luxury hotels in favor of hostels, I took her recommendation to heart and am glad I did. The Marina Bay Sands is a gigantic resort and convention hotel. Despite its size, the hotel is a well-oiled machine. The staff is attentive (except at the pool, where it was hard to get the attention of the rushed servers during my midweek visit) and the accommodations are as nice as any luxury hotel. Of course, the real reason to budget at least one night here is to enjoy the truly spectacular pool that lives up to the hype and then some.

Oh, uh, yeah, I did stay there. But I mean, there are other legitimacy fancy hotels in Singapore. And is MBS really that “fancy”?  I mean, it’s basically Vegas. The exact same restaurants. A casino. Luxury retail everywhere. And what do you think the ‘Sands’ in Marina Bay Sands is? Yeah, it’s the same Sands as in Vegas.  Check-in was busy, but it wasn’t too awful given how many people are checking in there everyday. And they gave us little ice cream treats! And the staff are friendly.  We ended up in a Club Room.

There is easy access to the MRT, Gardens By the Bay, the helix bridge and the Singapore Flyer.  Now the negatives:  This place is massive! So it takes forever to walk anywhere.

Not for me,MarBar,"My issue with this hotel is that the property is too big and therefore not very personalized. From a 30 minute line for check-in to an overcrowded pool area, or a lobby where not only hotel guests but also masses of non staying guests are walking, the hotel consistently lacks a relaxing atmosphere. If you like large Vegas properties, Marina Bay is probably a good fit, just be prepared to pay over $500 per night for a standard room.

Apart from the rooftop area/ pool, which is totally breathtaking, the rooms in the building itself were pretty average and a little smelly to be honest. You could find a nicer room for a cheaper price.   Singapore is very over prices, so be prepared to spend a lot on a regular meal and drink.   Night zoo was fun and educational and again, I’m glad we’ve seen it. Also a carnival was close by which was also fun.

You pay for the pool/brand,Peter B,"Stayed at two different hotels in Singapore:Mandarin Oriental and Marina Bay Sands. Marina Bay’s pool/skypark is quite amazing and is ABSOLUTELY a factor for the price of the room. They make it so apparent that each guest has to present their own room key to enter the pool area. FYI it costs $100SD extra for another key. The room is spacious, and the garden view is great, however the beds are very firm and the hotel is more of a convention center then a high class hotel.

The electric control was hanging from the wall and it was clear danger. They ended up changing our room but the room was not the greatest. You can see that the hotel is aging and it needs updates in the room, it was upsetting that this famous hotel did not value customer safety and comfort. The pool on the rooftop is amazing and the location is fantastic but I am…",4,April 2018,
Great hotel for a stopover,GuyaneseMadness,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands at the end of our multi city, Southeast Asia trip.   Check in: The check in line was quite large when we arrived, however staff members walked around frequently with fruit juice and water for everyone in line. The staff member checking us in was very friendly and informative. Our room wasn't ready at the beginning of the check in process, but by the end of it, a room opened up which was great.   Room: We had a premier room with views of the garden. When we walked into our room, the cleaning staff were still refreshing it and replacing the shower head as well. It was a bit odd, but they were friendly and weren't in the room too long. Our room was quite spacious and well lit. It reminded me a lot of many Las Vegas hotels I have stayed in, in the past.…",4,December 2018,
Singapore stopover,bgakowski,"We stayed in the Deluxe room ,  57 floor garden side  Pool was amazing  but very busy. Room was not impressive. A bit disappointed in the hotel . Restaurants  in hotel were average also. Best thing was the animal art work on the bed each day. ",3,March 2019,
Spectacular,Dan_Plymouth1989,"I guess the hotel itself isn’t 5* but the whole things is definitely up there. The building is superb, the staff are good, the rooms are nice & clean, the view is fantastic from any side, the pool is a spectacle in itself and the abundance of food/shops/bars etc & access to the rest of the city is top notch.   The hotel itself is a bit of a tourist hotspot and is just huge so there are just always so many people around. The lobby is hectic. But the staff do their best to keep it controlled.   The offer of valet parking for such a cheap price, multiple entries is a fantastic facility to offer (in particular in central Singapore) and considering the prices of parking surrounding the MBS.   Pool is as previously mentioned a spectacle on its own and is fantastic to check out. It’s…",5,December 2018,
Tick on the bucket list!,Jocatt,"We had 2 nights in Singapore for a layover and chose to stay in this iconic hotel. Previous reviews had raised cause for concern about the service but I am pleased to say our stay was superb. We took an executive room so that we were able to use Club 55 and that was definitely a good option. Checked in at 7am, our room was not ready but the luggage was stored and we had cards to access the pool. We had a coffee there and then visited the gardens. On our return room was ready as promised about 11am with the luggage already there. The room was huge and the view of the city, that we chose, amazing. Super bath, separate shower, twin basins and enormous bed. Settee and two chairs which we spent time in just taking in the view.

"Good view and good location, but crowded ",Chin L,"We stayed at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) for 3 nights in late February. After reading many negative reviews, I did not want to stay at MBS. However, a number of my relatives who had been there had good experiences and recommended it, so I decided to give MBS a try. I came to the hotel without high expectation, but I wasn’t disappointed.  Checking in was long, but I could not blame them because my reservations were complicated. Checkout was fast and easy. We just handed our room keys to the staff at the express checkout boxes in the lobby.   There was a glitch during our stay. I  did not even complained, but just asked them to sort it out. To my surprise, the supervisor not only solved the problem, but also sincerely gave us an apology, and compensated for the mistake nicely. I could…",5,February 2019,
What an experience!,Oncewhileaway,"We stayed here in March 2019 for our honeymoon. We arrived late into the evening, so check-in was quick. However, we can imagine that if you need to check-in during the day between 9am to 7pm, just be prepared to wait in a queue.   We loved it! We were in tower 2, upgraded to a family room, which had 2 separate bedroom areas and a great balcony overlooking the Gardens at the Bay. The real experience is the infinity pool, which is open to guests only and requires a room key each to enter. The hotel is connected to the MRT and exclusive high-end shops and restaurants.   The hotel is connected to the Gardens by the Bay by a bridge (don’t need to catch a taxi, which some guests were doing!)   Would we do it again? Probably not just by the price, but it is something you have to…",5,March 2019,
Fabulous pool!!!!,KarenAzinger,"This is much more than a hotel stay, this is an experience! The pool is amazing! The pool is worth the price! We arrived at 5;30 AM after a long flight from Nepal and we got checked into our room right away. We took a shower and headed straight to the pool! Total wow!!!!!!!! We went to the pool in the early morning, the afternoon and at night! Also the perfect place to stay to see the Supertree light show and the Cloud Forest Dome! Both are must sees in Singapore. And the food is fantastic! We did the breakfast buffet at Rise and it was great!",5,March 2019,
Fabulous Views from the pool,Wrightydj,"Stayed at the hotel in Feb 2019 for a work function. The hotel and its staff didn't disappoint. The views from the infinity pool and sun decks are wonderful and definitely worth visiting.  The cleanliness of the hotel and surrounding amenities i.e. Shopping Centre, Casino etc. is as you would expect from Singapore.  If you get the chance to stay at this hotel, do it!",5,February 2019,

Positives : 1. Staff are well trained, professional, friendly.  2. Room is large(mine was Deluxe), clean and reasonable amenities(no razor) though slightly disappointed the toiletries was not ""branded"" or packaged more premium for the asking room price. Bathroom was equally spacious and strong hot shower.  3. Splendid location, connected to an underground MRT adjoined to casino and huge shopping mall. Also connected to Garden by the Bay and a nice lake with well built jogging path.  4. Excellent view from the 57th floor open bar.   Dislikes 1.

Many may not know it by its real name, but everyone knows of the spaceship top hotel! This was my first time inside the hotel and I was blown away with its grandeur. It is magnificent both inside and out! If you are not staying here, be sure to visit the top view deck for the best views of Marina Bay, the Singapore Flyer Ferris Wheel and the Bay Garden areas.   BOTTOM LINE: Incredible hotel, casino and venue! The Singapore Marina Bay Convention Center is attached next door. It is also next to the Gardens by the Bay and Waterfront Promenade.

Once in a lifetime experience,raymondb944,"We have seen this hotel advertised on TV at home, so we thought ""go for it"". It's not the cheapest and it's very crowded due its popularity. We had a good experience at check in. The room was very spacious and well equipped and we had benefit of a high up gardens view. If I was to be critical it is that it is a spectacle for all to come and see so it is always busy, noisy and crowded on the ground floor. Our experience of breakfast was good on day 1 but not as slick after. The pool is one of its draws and is also very busy. But hey, this a once in a lifetime and the hotel is a victim of its own successful propoganda. Our stay was great and worth every penny as a one off.",4,March 2019,
Three Night Faultless Stay,Matt S,"Great hotel, good location with fantastic views. The roof top pool is a plus but also a novelty. Room on the 39th Floor had really good views out into the city, good bed and lovely bathroom. We've stayed in better 5 star rooms but staying at Marina Bay Sands is about the experience - pool, location, hotel facilities etc. The pool was a highlight but also super busy post 11am - expect sun loungers to be reserved with towels early on and lots of instagrammers, However service from the pool staff was really good and the food also fantastic. We felt it was a really good hotel for a stopover whilst on our way to Thailand.",4,February 2019,

Next nice drinks came out and then we got whisked away to the posh area to be checked in. Room not ready but they gave us a temporary key to enjoy amenities and emailed us when the room was ready. Went up to 57th floor and enjoyed a lovely brunch. Room was expected of a five star hotel. We chose a sky room. We got one on the 42nd floor. I suppose it could have been higher but the view of the bay was amazing. Went up to infinity pool and sky deck. My only grumble was there  these people who  were walking around in their dressing gowns at night up there. Very busy but it is a big hotel.

Amazing hotel,Constantine D,"My wife and I stayed at MBS for 2 nights in early October 2019. The hotel is really expensive - however, we wanted to experience the hotel, especially the swimming pool on the rooftop, so we decided to splurge. It was worth it!  Great check in experience - we got a small upgrade and a room on the 13th floor with the great view of the Gardens by the Bay.   Our room and bathroom were palatial and very comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay.  Internet was included. Breakfast was not in the rate - plenty of options at the MBS foodcourt if you want an inexpensive breakfast. The hotel is connected to the Bayfront MRT station - very convenient.  On Day 2 we went out and when we came back we found that the hotel made us personalized hand towels with our last names! What a nice gesture!…",4,March 2019,
Beautiful Hotel with some rude middle eastern check in staff.,sophieygo,"Booked and paid in advance for a total of 21 rooms, 2 nights stay of our valued dealer, but my guest and I complained that we are treated rudely by mostly middle eastern female staff at the check in counter, these girls lack politeness and courtesy when making conversation, they seems to feel proud and superior over the guest they are checking in. And they work like turtles that's why queue at the check-in counter of tower 1 is always long.  I hope I won't see them again when I visit this coming April.

And very special view from roof top-pool! We appreciated the direct entry to the metro (MRT) below ground level of the hotel.  Warm welcoming in the hotel. While queuing we got mineral water and icecream!  Although very expensive its worth a visit!,4,February 2019,
Truly excellent,Jonathan P,Lots of reviews on here but we took a club room with the the extra access and afternoon tea and evening canapés included. This is the best it could be from the vast rooms to excellent service. Lots of vain people here but could not spoil our enjoyment and the extra for the the club amenities and freebies are well worth the money - drinks flow and food is more tapas than canapés. This hotel is best left for special occasions as it will make everything else seem mediocre.,5,February 2019,
"Most I have ever spent on a hotel, but worth every penny",SBoyer224,"We could have spent our entire Singapore vacation in and around MBS and would not have been disappointed.  Before mentioning the Sky Park and amazing pool, there is easy access to Gardens by the Bay, MBS Shoppes, Artscience Museum, casino, river boats, boardwalks, electric scooters, etc.  And  when it is time to explore further, the Bayfront MRT station is on the property. I debated for over a day about spending this much for a hotel before booking the room.  As we were driving away on the last day I showed the bill to my husband, and asked him if it was worth it.

Check in was easy in the lounge adjacent to the main check-in desk in Tower 1.  Very efficient.  Our bags arrived in our room very quickly.  Afternoon tea at Club 55 was very nice with a nice selection of sweets, include little scones.  Breakfast at Club 55 is a mix of Eastern & Western foods; I tried only the Eastern foods and they were delicious.  Dinner at Lavo was excellent.

We went straight to the pool at 12.30 their were various sun loungers available the inifity pool was incredible and did start to get busy from 3pm. We found the food and drink prices very reasonable considering the cost of the hotel, a coca cola was $5 and cocktails $19 - $22.

It goes the whole length of the top with an observatory  area at one end.  There is a bar and lunch served at pool. The observatory area at end and gets very crowded at the restaurant there so go early.  If your room is not included in the observatory, You can pay extra to get a pass to go up.

"Very good, perhaps overselling the pool",altakoi,"There isn't much to add to the reviews of the MBS, its a truely awesome building and a clean, well run hotel immediately adjacent to some amazing shops. Just one point I would make, because it seems to be a big part of people choosing the hotel is (forgive me pool Gods), and that is the pool deck is not that awesome an actual experience.  Yes, the pool is nice. But its also pretty crowded pretty much all the time and its not particularly large or deep. Its mostly for bobbing around in and, of course, everyone is taking selfies. ALL.THE.TIME. So go, have a bob, have a beer, but its not a thing you'll do for a week.

Great Option,Warren H,Ok. The hotel is massive and very Vegas in style and yes it has the iconic pool on the roof! I’m pleased we stayed here. Our room was well appointed and spacious but not luxurious. The pool is amazing and worth the hype! I’d recommend the hotel to anyone just to experience all that it has to offer. One of our most memorable dining experiences was at Spago and I really enjoyed our stay!,4,March 2019,

Not to be missed. Then they got our room ready before noon and when we got to the room our bags were already there. The hotel in right in Marina Bay so you can walk everywhere. The Shoppes across the street can be accessible from the underground walk to the incredible mall. The light show is beside the mall.

pre cruise treat,Julie S,yes this hotel is iconic and stunning. We had a marina view on 42nd floor. Rooms were very spacious with all mod cons  but service not quite as expected. Instant coffee in room and in spite of asking for mint tea bags these did not come (not what you expect for The price you pay) The infinity pool although impressive can get very crowded. Breakfast was ok but again restaurants were crowded.  Definately not value for money and while it's a tick off bucket list  I probably wouldn't return even at half the cost.,4,March 2019,
What an experience!,Sebastián B,"This hotel is not only a highlight of Singapore but also a delightful experience itself.

Have a drink at C’est la Vi,AJC399,Don’t buy the ticket to the Skypark and observation deck. You can get a ticket for $22 SGD pp for the C’est La Vi bar that then acts as credit for food & beverage at the bar.

Honeymoon 2 night stop over,BeckzB,"My husband and I stayed here as the first leg of our honeymoon. We don't usually stay at hotels as expensive as this so it was a real treat for us. When it comes to this hotel, I believe you are not just paying for a room. You are paying for the experience, the location, the quality of the staff they employ and obviously the amazing infinity pool on the roof. We had an amazing stay, the room was fantastic as was the view and the location being by the gardens by the bay and the massive shopping center with food court was great. We're so glad we stayed here to experience it and would recommend it.",5,February 2019,
Famous but...,Niña N.,"Not worth the price, when we arrived at the hotel and opened the drawer there’s a note from the previous guest.

We liked our rooms, they were lovely, w/comfortable beds, spotless, clean, roomy with a spacious ensuite bathroom and had wonderful views of Singapore, the bay and the nightly colorful fountain show. The service was of course top notch as expected for such a high price tag. It was very convenient having the hotel connected to a mall, the casino, the gardens by the bay and the MRT transportation system and very easy to navigate.

Overrated hotel,AMI,"A beautiful hotel to look at from a distance.  As soon as you arrive the building seems like a busy office with crowds and crowds of people either to and fro from the built in mall or to the boutique shops at ground floor.  The check in counters are buried to one side of the building and are quite congested.  The rooms are spacious but a locked mini fridge and a water dispenser that dispenses the same temperature water as 'cold' or 'room' temperatures at such a high cost of room rate, you begin to wonder what you've paid so much for...

I’m really happy we did it, but I wouldn’t stay there again.  The breakfast at the Spago (rooftop) was delicious, however the understandable queue (so many guest from 3 different buildings) to get in (around 25min) made everything look & taste delicious. There are other breakfast option areas, but this is of course the most popular due to its location.

Still fabulous,BigMan66,"The MBS is still one of my favourites - in Singapore and beyond. You just have to admire the almost perfect organization of that huge place with approx. 2,500 rooms.  Check-in can require patience if you arrive at peak times. We were lucky, no queue. Rooms are spaceous and are still feeling good. If there was a Nespresso machine in the room, it would get 5+ stars from me. Big bathrooms, plenty of storage area for luggage and clothes (especially when you arrive from places like Sydney, where even luxury hotels offer very little pace...)  The pool area is still spectacular, even though it is very crowded most times. It has just become a little too popular.

Amazing hotel for honeymooners,Li L,"My husband and I stayed at MBS for one week. It was our honeymoon. We booked a twin bed room, because that was the only available option. When we got to the reception, we kindly asked if we could upgrade to a King bed room. The nice worker who checked us in, did just that. First point for that.  The property is huge. The shopping mall underneath is incredible, with all kinds of stores and restaurants. The Casino was also big, and super fun.  The convenience of this hotel is the best part of it. Everything is just there,without the hassle of having to go out.  The rooms are very spacious, clean with beautiful bathrooms. I usually hate hotel beds, but these were SO COMFY. The size is perfect.

A room with a view and that’s all,Glenn Dabatos,"I was looking forward to celebrating my 55th birthday at this highly touted and promoted hotel. After all I’ve seen when they were building the towers and looked like a scene from a Star Trek movie. My first experience as we entered the cavernous lobby was just that, a very busy yet uninspiring lobby lacking intimacy. I booked a sky view room at the 45th floor with a view of the Marina. The room was large with a good size living area and a large bathroom. The bed was great to sleep in and the view is spectacular. However I noticed the light switches to the bathroom was near the entrance hence at night one has to walk to the door to turn on the lights.

Pretty cool,Col T,"Stayed in a club room on 46th floor facing the gardens and ocean. Spectacular views.  The staff are absolutely wonderful, friendly and so helpful. Nothing is a problem for them, From check in to the pool deck.  The famous rooftop infinity pool is awesome. It’s actually divided into 3 pools. One is adults only. But spectacular views all around. There is a child’s pool as well. Lifeguards are on duty in all pools. You can order food and drinks from your chair also. Glad to have had the chance to stay here. Will come back one day for certain. Thank you. ",5,March 2019,
Amazing Hotel in Singapore,Maria Guadalupe P,"This is one of the most impressive hotels in the whole world!!! 57 floors and at the top a great view of al around Singapore. You could see the gardens of the bay, the big fountain of the Lion, The museum of LV etc. an impressive view.!! and at the basement one of the greatest malls with a channel of water like in Venice, stores of the best brands in the world, a big food court .....!!!",5,January 2019,
What a view from the 57th floor.,thekarenorr,We visited here and went to the restaurant on the 57th floor for free and had a cold drink just to get the ambiance and the view. It is spectacular.. cheaper than paying for the observation deck although view may be just from one end of the structure. The pool area on this floor for residents only looks fabulous with an infinity pool but for those who can afford to stay here!,5,March 2019,
"Glad we stayed, but not sure id spend the money again.",Donna S,"We had a very nice stay at the hotel for one night prior to heading out on a cruise. We arrived early and there were only a few people ahead of us in line to check in. They had availability for us to check in early. Room is spacious and well appointed & comfortable. We had a high floor city facing view. Was great to view the evening fountain display from our room. Wonderful to watch the city lights at night. The infinity pool area was busy even though it was sprinkling. We had to take the obligatory dip. The views from the top are incredible! i found the lobby to be somewhat bland and unappealing. Overall our stay was great, but not sure id spend the money to do it again.",5,February 2019,
Singapore  has better,Jim B,A great experience but will go elsewhere next time we visit Singapore. Staff excellent but having to go up and down between the three towers was a pain. Pool area is man attraction but water was cold and loungers we’re very uncomfortable and there was a lack of shade.,4,February 2019,
A disappointing 5 star hotel,Amjaid R,"The check in was very slow , had to queue up for 20 mins.. ! The rooms were smaller then expected , bathroom was very oddly designed. The shower head tucked in a corner with a large bath tub situated in the middle . The toilet was separated by an internal partition , however with no bidet  facility .  The hotel lobby also very oddly designed , a lot of open space , all the way to the top , the restaurants/ lounge hidden by large circular partitioning . Access to the shopping mall / casino and sky park easily available. Found the so talked about infinity pool very small , separated in 2 sections, the loungers placed very close to each other. A very cramped environment with little chance of relaxation .  Very disappointing indeed. No access was allowed after checking out at 11am .…",3,February 2019,
Breathtaking view from infinity pool and spacious rooms,Irene G,"An insane view from the rooftop infinity pool, that actually justifies the high price of the room (as only hotel guests can use the pool). I couldn't take my eyes off. Unfortunately it is very crowded, apart from 6-7am, so if you are looking to relax by the pool, just forget it. This is not a quiet hotel anyway. There are queues for check in and check out, and for each of them I had to wait about 10 minutes - it usually takes me less to check in at the airport. The room was spacious, although the furniture and decoration was very generic type chain hotel. There was an amazing view though from the window. The hotel itself is an incredible architectural masterpiece and it's a pleasure to be a registered guest. The staff was very professional and the breakfast and dinner was very…",4,February 2019,
Nice but not worth the money.,d1993g,"My boyfriend and I are currently on a round the world trip and visited singapore few a days, so we decided to stay one night in marina bay.   Now don’t get me wrong it is lovely but not £400 a night lovely. The que for check in took quite a while, considering the size of the hotel, i would of expected more staff to be working on it.   We had a issue where the wifi wouldn’t work in the room, three calls and 45 minutes later, we ended up having to have a guy from the IT department having to come to the room to “fix it”, but then half a hour later it wouldn’t work again and as we were only in the hotel for a night. We didn’t have the time to waste waiting for him again .When we mentioned this at the check out the guy couldn’t of cared less.   The shopping centre, the gardens, and…",3,March 2019,
Not worth the money....,dabigmac2016,"Buyer beware! You’re buying into the hype and tourist trap dream. Cheapest rooms here are the deluxe rooms, which I booked for two nights. The premier room and upgraded suites didn’t seem worth it but now that I think back, what’s the difference of over paying a lot as opposed to over paying a little bit less than a lot. Makes no difference, I guess. The room has automatic drapes, which is kinda cool, overall the rooms look dated. They are quite spacious and clean with nice views but at a minimum of 500 USD I think I’ll stay elsewhere next time. Lifts are usually busy and a long wait. Their signature rooftop pool is almost always busy or being cleaned. The staff is hit or miss. Some are super friendly and others seem a bit pretentious at times. The housekeeping staff I…",3,March 2019,
Stunning,Vaclav K,"There is nothing more to say. The rooms are big. Views are amazing. Food is delicious. Staff is highly competent and have excellent service attitude. Compared to other places I have rated with 5 points, this should actually get at least 7.",5,February 2019,
Staycation on my Birthday!,Nashitah,"The last stays was in 2011, the check-in took awhile.  But now although we have check-in at Tower 3 but not much hassle & fast.  Since we are paying cash so we are able to do the express check-out.  Caught by surprise when back for dinner, there was a small cake in our room.  Thank you, MBS!!❤️❤️. Hope the Management of Rise will be able to cater for small Halal food near future for Muslims.",4,March 2019,
Amazing experience!!!,ChezzaP681,"We stopped over in Singapore for a night before flying to Thailand. We had an amazing experience! We stayed in the Orchid Garden suite. The suite was incredible, very spacious, fantastic views from the 52nd floor. The bed was extremely comfortable. The infinity pool was the best experience. The staff were really attentive, willing to go that extra mile which always makes you feel special. I will definitely visit again!!!",5,March 2019,
A Casino That Charges Admission for Some,wireless_in_CA,"To get onto the casino floor remember to bring your passport so you don’t have to pay a fee to go inside.  Singaporeans were charged admission.  You also need to show your passport to leave.  They were pretty strict about checking.    Once inside, the casino floor was huge.  Lots of tables and dealers but not every one had gamblers.  Restaurants were sprinkled around and unlike Vegas I found a reasonably priced place serving hand pulled noodles for less than 20 SGD.  free drinks were available via the waitresses, soda fountain dispenser or coffee maker near the entrance and a moving robotic drink cart.   For the cart, just press the button to get it to stop and grab a water or soda.  It talked too much.  To visit the iconic portion of the hotel, the cost was $23SGD to take a…",4,March 2019,
Hotel,VaibhavIndore,"This is an amazing experience and extremely well located. In a walking distance you have the gardens by the Bay, super trees and cloud forest dome. In addition, you have access to the helix bridge.  The rooms are spacious and with a beautiful sightseeing.",5,January 2019,
Iconic but also very disapponting.,Herwig C,Amazing architecture.  Part of the Singapore story.  Very spacious and nice room + bathroom.   But far too big and crowded.  The staff tries to be friendly but too busy.  Breakfast very expensive and not worth the price.  Spa super expensive.  Very disappointing experience!,3,February 2019,
Disneyland for grown ups,edob143,Do go for a drink on the topfloor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Amazing view at night wheras food and drinks are served in a casual atmosphere,5,,
Intimidating but lovely,GlobalPal,It truly stands by its popularity. Beautiful grounds and amazing infinity pool on the 57th floor. We were on the 9th floor so we had to transfer twice to get to the pool so if you can then try to get a top floor. Facing the gardens was amazing. I definitely would love to come back.   The website seemed deceiving since it mentioned some rooms don’t get access to the pool but when checking in they told me anyone staying in the hotel has access to the pool.,5,February 2019,
Great Hotel be prepared for crowds,bindeeboo,"Had a great 2 night stay at hotel, rooms were as expected, clean and well presented. Views were fantastic. Infinity pool was lovely but extremely crowded, not a relaxing poolside experience.  Great stopover for the experience.",4,January 2019,

It’s got it all,Brett P,Great location. All the shops you could ask for. Plenty of restaurants. Huge hotel but it works well. Comfortable and clean rooms. We were only there 24 hours but will be back for a longer stay next time,5,February 2019,
Convenient location and nice rooms,ireneliu,"We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands Resort for 4 days in February. Check in was fairly quick and we were offered drinks while we waited. Eric at the check in counter was kind enough to offer us a room on a higher floor. Our category was between the 10-42 floor and he gave us a room on the 39th floor. It was not ready when we checked in at 1:30pm but he explained that we would get an email as soon as it was ready. So we went to the food court for some lunch and by the time we were done our room was ready at 3pm. The room was huge, the view of the Gardens by the Bay was really nice and there was a small balcony. The toiletries are very nice and we were given 4 complimentary water bottles each day. The location was very central, easy to get to Chinatown and Bugis Street for shopping.…",4,February 2019,
You go there for the pool,C C,"You go there for the pool and the amazing city views and that's it. As a hotel it has no personality for being so big and the rooms are quite regular, sort of a standard business hotel design. The bathroom was quite nice though.  I was concerned about the pool being too crowded but if you stay there long enough (I suggest 2 nights at least) and go up there at different times, you get different experiences. For instance it was quite empty and relaxing during midday (maybe due to leavers checking out at 11am and newcomers not checking in until 2-3 pm as earliest) however it was quite busy around sunset and later on.   The daily light show outside the hotel is amazing and Gardens by the Bay is one of the most amazing places to visit in Singapore.",4,February 2019,
Just perfect,Marko V,"We spent 3 days here in an upper floor room (41th) with city view.   This hotel has the best customer experience I have ever faced.  We really enjoyed of services which worked very well and service attitude of personnel was awesome  We checked in during peak period with queue. We were offered ice cream and juice when waiting for our check-in turn.  We got our room already at noon even official time is 15:00 which was really nice surprise.  We also visited at a roof pool on 57th floor several times. It has amazing views and nice restaurant services. It was not so big surprise that the pool area was pretty crowded.  Gym on 55th was also nice, could be a bit cooler though.   Breakfast was also awesome, even though we usually arrived there just before the end of service hours.  A…",5,,
Just a money-machine.,ForeverDyO,"We came to this place only for the stunning infinity pool and we really enjoyed the spectaculars views from our  “city view” room, just don’t expect front desk or other staff to be welcoming or friendly, they provide only average service.  We confirm all the great TA reviews related to the amazing infinity pool but room’s décor and furniture is quite anonymous and impersonal. Main disappointing point is the service: during check in we asked for the complimentary cocktails mentioned in our reservation and we were told that it was impossible  for us to have complimentary drinks because we paid a “cheap” price for the room; is this the manner to talk to your customers?  Is 600€ a “cheap” price? This is such a big and impressive place without the right customer service attitude: …",3,February 2019,
"Great customer service, great rooms, amazing views from infinity pool.",Aayush,"About us: My partner and I were visiting Singapore as part of our honeymoon and we decided to take the Club Room (Room 3651) for 2 nights. I had previously called the reception to organise some flower decoration for my wife as part of the honeymoon and we weren't disappointed.   Room: The room was very clean, beds and pillow were extremely comfortable. The flower decoration for the honeymoon was done nicely. On the first night, we had plenty of rose petals from the main door to the bedroom, we also had plenty of rose petals on the bed.  Infinity Pool: The pool is breathtaking, gets really busy from 10pm as the pool closes as 11pm, but regardless of that, you should still go then and enjoy the music, the view and the water.

Best Infinity Pool Ever!,gabbyc1994,"The infinity pool at this hotel is actually as good as everyone says it is! I am super happy that it lived up to the hype!! The pool also had great food and drinks (but note the high price tag!). That said, the hotel room was very nice and comfortable. Nothing particularly special, but no complaints from me. The only point to note is that the hotel is slightly more expensive than other options in the area, but I do really feel the amazing pool was worth it! Also, I felt the location was also great – so close to the Gardens by the Bay and other main attractions! If you’re on a budget, I recommend even staying here at least 1 night so you can spend a day relaxing with beautiful views! Overall, great hotel and would stay again!",4,December 2018,
Nice infinity pool view,Iby B,"The service is great, you can get a room with a view of the bay or a view of the gardens, the infinity pool is the spot in the hotel with the most amazing views of Singapore. The water is a little in the cold side though,  but they also have a hot tub with a view of the  gardens. amazing hotel.",5,February 2019,
Great location and facilities,Robert F,"I think if you go to Singapore you have to stay at least one night in this iconic hotel. The infinity pool at the Rooftop is incredible and you have an amazing view of the city. You won’t be able to see it unless you are staying at the hotel. They also have the shops, huge mall with everything you can imagine. Better mall than the one in Dubai. The rooms are good not exceptional. It feels like you are in a hotel in Vegas.",4,February 2019,
It’s a tourist Attraction with rooms !!!,Misspiggy21,"We booked a city view king club room. Received exactly what we booked, good sized room, good amenities, just not as practical as it should be. Bed is rock hard. Pillows are very good, but the bed kills your back.  You are a number only at this hotel, it is a great engineering feat but lags badly in being a warm feeling luxury hotel. We booked to use the club lounge and this was warmly met by the staff who were very nice and remembered us after a few visits. The club is large but it needs to be as many guests have access. It has no feeling of exclusiveness, once full it has the feeling of a cheap cafeteria. There are kids everywhere, no control with them, food on the floor and not cleaned up after they left. This was at multiple tables. Evening drinks should be drinks and some…",3,February 2019,
Shopping,BCross62,There is something for everyone. From top designers to the truly unique. Restaurants from 5 star to a food court. If you visit plan on being here for quite a while. It is very large . I think what coughs my eye first were the boats inside . Enjoy,5,February 2019,
Magnificent MBS,Fred Torres,"Stayed at MBS for 2 nights with 4 other couples. First timers. Amazing facility where you don't have to go elsewhere to find food and lots of shopping. Food court was amazing!. Check-in staff very professional and accommodating. Had 2 morning breakfast which is up on the 57th floor by the poolside.  Kudos to waiters like Angelo, Rev and James for doing a superb job in taking good care of us. These people are so wonderful and very friendly. We will definitely stay again at MBS next time we travel to Singapore. Almost forgot, the view while you're on the pool on 57th floor is nothing short of spectacular, especially at night. Make sure you give yourself time to relax on the pool- you'll be amazed. You will run out of selfie poses.",5,February 2019,
Disappointing service,Yola87,We had one of the best rooms with great view overlooking river. Unfortunately the room itself is a little outdated. You don’t feel specialty even with upgrades. The only amazing thing is infinity pool and you pay mainly for this . In general hotel is overpriced. Service is not helpful. We got charged 3 times more for taxi on the way to airport which was very disappointing.,3,February 2019,
Must Do,Audrey S,"We stayed one night in a deluxe king garden view room which was around S$530.   Arrived 3 hours before check in and were delighted to be checked in early with staff friendly and very helpful.  Room was very nicely decorated, clean and the view was amazing...we were up around the 30th floor with a balcony overlooking the gardens at the bay. Good shower, firm bed and good air-conditioning.   Infinity pool is a must...amazing views, albeit very busy as expected with no shade.  Cocktails at Spago Bar S$26 each, however very well made. Recommend the skydeck.

Special place with the best pool ever,amaaten10,Stayed here during the formula 1....absolutely loved the pool...the pool can be busy but there is always some place where you can sit down... when they saw we were with a little kid they arranged an early check inn with Some extra pay....that was great....the hotel for sure is expensive but its definately worth it.  The good: - amazing pool and also the rest of the skypark is great  - Nice room with a great view - great atmosphere...its really alive - check inn and check out proces.  What can be better: - I missed the old bathroom amenities. The new merk was less good. - it took considerable time before the amount quaranteed via my creditcard was finally settled. - its expensive.,5,September 2018,
