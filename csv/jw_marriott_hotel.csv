They hold us deposit $2600 even when we had checked out. And gave us excuses too busy to do the refund. So I had to send a complaint email. They even tried to overcharge us $300 more.

Distinctive hotel experience,10,"Almost everything that all travelers are looking for and we find it distinctive - brand new facilities (room and swimming pool), clean, perfect locations (Walking distance with shelter to 3 MRT lines + 3 shopping malls while hotel itself is surrounded by restaurants, pubs, and convenience stores), good breakfast, and warmest staff throughout the stay.","Our sole dissatisfaction is - when we found at room only 2 large plush robes which seemed not suitable for my wife - we made a call ""0"" for another smaller size plush robe and it took forever to deliver (ie. never received till the day we checked out).",Wen,Family,Premier King Suite with Executive lounge access,2,"14, 2019",Singapore,sg,[List]

Bad stay,1,Facilities,"Bad service and attitude from front office staff, especially staff called  HELEN !!!!

👍👍👍👍,10,"We got the family room at the highest floor and the view was superb! The view from the pool was outstanding too, both day and night.
The room was very clean and I personally enjoyed blasting the speakers in the bathroom while soaking myself in the tub!",The water in the pool was too cold to dip even during the day.

It was still a good stay. Although the experience could have been better,8,"My daughter enjoyed the bathroom amenities/ toiletries for kids
The closeness to Suntec and access to MRT was great","Initially requested for one of their campers, so I had to adjust my booking from a single room to 2 rooms as the hotel recommended. But then after doing what the hotel recommended, I wasn't given the camper anyway. Apparently already fully taken but then why make me adjust my booking if that was the case. They also promised simple decor for my daughter's birthday which didn't materialize. We still got the free cake though, which was a nice sentiment",Maria,Family,"Deluxe Room Twin, Guest room, 2 Twin/Single Bed(s)",2,"19, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Overall rating is excellent...  I will visit again.,10,"1.  The room I booked, has a great city view.  
2.  The room was spacious and importantly the bed and pillows are upto standard. 
Overall the room is worth the $$$ paid for","1. Room availability must be made readiness at the actual time of check-in (if not earlier).  Do not let guests wait for hours.
2.  The afternoon tea at the lounge was not pleasant enough.  Just a few pastry and cakes and not that fresh too.
3.  The breakfast was too ""limited"" per order.  A long list of main dish but each pax can only order 1 item.  Errr ... for the price we paid for the room, that's not very sweet.",Nancy,Family,Club Premier Room with Executive Lounge Access,2,"30, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]

Comfortable stay but......,7,"Love the location of the hotel. Located in the civic district, it is close to major malls as well as arts, cultural and heritage sites.","1. Shortage in manpower and high occupancy rate resulted in service delay during breakfast (Beach Road Kitchen) and cocktails (Executive Lounge). Many of our items ordered were either late or missed out.
2. Amenities such as bathrobes, slippers and toiletries in the room were also insufficient (prepared for two, rather than four adults which we had booked for). Housekeeping fell short as well when they missed several of our requests for additional amenities. 
3. Would be better if the hotel could provide a turndown service to prepare the sofa bed just before nightfall so that in the day, the living area could still be used. 
4. Due to safe distancing measures, many of the seats at the lobby were cordoned off from usage. This was a problem when there was long queue for check-in and seniors had no where to sit and wait.",Karen,Group,Deluxe King Suite with Executive Lounge Access,2,"20, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]
