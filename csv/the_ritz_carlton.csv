Instead we ordered food to be deliver at lobby and bought food at the nearest shopping centre which is Marina Square.I am surprised to get such awesome treatment from your staffs and they were helpful and assisted me during my two nights stay there.I will surely return again for sure as your staffs were thoughtful to give me complimentary brithday treats and again another complimentary chocolates.Indeed it was a memorable for me and my family.The view from our bedroom was lovely as it was facing Marina Bay Sands.The beds are large and the day bed as well.Amenities such as toiletries and some cushions were found inside our room.Not too forgot the big bathroom and bathtub as well.-It exceeded my expectations.I shall recommend to others😄,It will be better to have attached bidet in cubicle.,Nur,Family,Grand Marina Room with King Bed and Marina Bay view,2,"14, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]

Exceptional,10,"Top notch service by all the staff, especially for Singapore standards.  Probably the best I have come across having stayed in multiple 5* hotels in SG (e.g. Shangri-La Orchard, MBS etc).  Cheers to Cally who was on night shift and very kind in attending to my 2am room mishap.  Zabid from the front office for making every effort to take care of our family's needs, and Isabelle from the Club lounge.
Food and drinks (wine / Singapore Sling) at the Club Lounge was excellent.
Club lounge feels much more premium than the one at MBS which is quite a circus (crowded and can be noisy).  Ritz caters to more professional business guests, and the ratio of staff / tables to club lounge members make the experience feel much more premium than the Level 55 club lounge at MBS.
View and privacy is definitely better than the Valley Wing experience at Shangri-La which is on the 1st floor next to the reception and can be rather distracting with people walking past.
Rooms are immaculately maintained (for the age of property), and very beautiful - especially those facing the marina bay.
If you have kids, remember to ask them to do the Ritz Kids experience which was a nice touch to reward my daughter for completing the quest with a nice scoop of ice cream from Colony restaurant.",Their infrastructure may need major maintenance as water pump broke down twice during my 1 night stay which resulted in very loud and quite scary buzzing noise (especially if in the middle of the night).,Michelle,Family,Club Deluxe Kallang Room with Kallang Precinct view,1,"11, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]

Мы позвонили на ресепшен чтобы пришли убрали туалет.. К нам пришли через ЧАС! И не понимая по английски наши объяснения - а тут сложно не понять - клозет или WC или toilet.. уборщицы принялись убирать номер при нас.. 
ладно с туалетом разобрались:( хотя это была неприятная находка..
Далее выяснилось, что наш номер располагается рядом с лифтовым холлом. А вот с лифтами в отеле БЕДА! Они шумят так:(( как будто у вас за дверью ездит метро.. лифтами гости пользуются активно и звук подъема и спуска лифта НЕ ПРЕКРАЩАЕТСЯ ни днём ни ночью. 
Побыв в номере часа два, мы не выдержали и спустились на ресепшен. Объяснили им ситуацию и к нашему счастью, нас без проблем переселили в другой номер:)) Тут уже все было идеально!!!

Okay,5.8,Clean and nice hotel.,"Arrival to the hotel:
So it looks like people with BMW / Mercedess and other expensive cars just block a lane. Blame
For the rich people which park again just close to entrance and block as well a lane as they are to lazy to walk. Many guests have to wait in their taxis because of those VIP kids... you are not the same
Worth as a guest to this hotel as the management strongly focus for the richest people and having their Ferrari’s just 1 step away if entrance.
Check in:
A chaos which could be not even worse. There are no lanes which guide the guests, people stay around , rush to a free desk without waiting, no management on this! The GM need urgently to visit some other hotels. On the request “why there are no one who guide it, or why you don’t put any lanes” I got response “it is not good for the design, we have a special design in our hotel.

The bed and shower are devine including the roller bed or sofa bed made for the little one!,"The room smelled weird upon checkin but your nose quickly adjust to it. We thought it was the humidity and the lockdown led to temporary smell but at the end of our check out we realised that might very well be a smoking room which was why the smell doesn’t go away after days.
Poor communication at check in and lack of solution at the lobby desk. We were not told at the check in that no buffet or dine-in breakfast will be served due to covid situation. Instead we were told S$48 per pax for breakfast. We woke up late and the young one was super hungry. We went downstairs to the usual restaurant Colony for breakfast and was told by the cleaning ladies there that no breakfast will be served but only at Club floor. At the hotel lobby, when I was asking the concierge desk, we were told that only order in was available and it will take at least 30mins if they help to expedite the orders. When I told them the need for my little one to get food, the ladies busy calling around but offered no option as to what they can do to resolve the issue. I offered to go up to the club floor with immediate access to food for my little one and we will happily pay for it and no feedback or decision. After a long time, the lobby manager Douglas came to facilitate and offered immediate pancake ordered for my little one and access to food for us right away.  We were
Also well taken care of at the breakfast place, which shows they are really trying to resolve the issue. Overall, I understand the unusual situation led to the mistake to advise your guests, but it really shouldn’t happen to Ritz!",Samantha,Family,Elevated Kallang Room with Kallang Precinct view,2,"11, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]
Ritz Carlton staycation,6,"Cleanliness, view from the room","Availability of the room we booked (we booked King bed and were given two double bed), late availability of the room (check in at 3pm but room available at 4pm), no breakfast on Sundays (they have a champagne brunch which needs to be booked well in advance)",Remi,Couple,Grand Marina Room with King Bed and Marina Bay view,1,"3, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]
"It was very cosy and private, than if we were to go to a resort type staycation.",7,"We liked the view and that's why I went back there, but the room seems to have ""shrunk""? I booked for my own stay a few times many years ago - and the last time turn out to be 10 years already. And apart from feeling the room shrunk, the pool and other facilities remained the same, hence it was rather ""boring"", apart from the view which was impressive. But we stayed at Marina Bay Sands, and it has very impressive view too. So the main question is what's the differentiation, apart from the sentimental which I stayed for myself many years ago. I even had my daughter's first birthday celebration cum xmas at the Ritz 10 years ago. she is 10 years old now.","We didn't know if there were other ""guests' that may be under quaranteen of COVID 19 issues, hence a bit concerning.",V,Family,Deluxe Marina Room with Marina Bay view,1,"28, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]

All I got from the receptionist was that there was a miscommunication and they thought I wanted a marina facing room and they did not have any flyer facing room anymore. They only offer a late check out as a compensation. I’m disappointed with the level of service and the hotel’s attitude towards serving individual  leisure guests like me.

"Other than the breakfast situation post cruise, we were pleased with hotel.  Going back in Dec.",10,Our premier suite was spacious and comfortable. This is located in the corner and it faces the Marina. It is my husband and my favorite section to stay. We have been selecting the Ritz Carlton Millennia for our Singapore stay because it is located in a great part of the City. Needless to say service was excellent from the front door to the rooms; restaurants etc. Our family's favorite hotel in Singapore.,"I forgot to select the room & breakfast package when I booked our 4 rooms post cruise, so I had to pay SGD56 ++ per person for the breakfast buffet. There were 10 of us so we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel everyday. ( I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights pre cruise with breakfast included). Since it wasn't included in our New Year's stay, , I felt it was silly to spend in excess of SGD 600, for 10 just for breakfast  when some of us would eat so little. So those who were hungry and wanted a buffet breakfast went to the Colony. The rest of us who were not up to a buffet, ate in eateries close by in the Marina Square. It would be preferable, if there was an ala carte breakfast menu in the Colony as well.",Veronica,Family,Premier Suite with King Bed and Marina Bay view,4,"2, 2020",United States of America,us,[List]
