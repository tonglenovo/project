Perfect luxury escapes,Itravel0ne,"After a long break, it‚Äôs time to travel and find a short escape. Can‚Äôt fault all and this is a perfect stay from arrival to departure. There‚Äôs a family pool on the 20th floor and a lap pool on the 3rd floor. Gymn is also on the 3rd floor and well equipped. Thoroughly enjoyed the room and amenity and also the breakfast. Need to plan a quick return soon.",5,,
A memorable stay,MJ & S,"We stayed at Four Seasons Singapore for a week and really enjoyed it. The staff were excellent and polite, we felt the service was one of the best we have ever received. Our room was spacious and clean, the beds were very comfortable. The pools/gym were spotless and well looked after. The location of the hotel is also excellent, plenty of shopping and food options and good transport links. We stayed at 2 other five star hotels during our trip to Singapore, neither of them come even close to the Four Seasons experience.  A big thanks to all the staff for making our stay so special.",5,,
Exceeded my Expectations,marcobravo88,"Overall, a great stay at FS Singapore. It's all about the small details that made my experience really wonderful throughout my stay. I also caught Covid during my stay and I was very well taken care of during my isolation period. Rooms are nicely renovated and also LOVE the new gym as well (easily one of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen). If you are staying in Orchard, look no further and would highly recommend to stay in this lovely property!",5,,
A Thoughtful Experience,SifuTones,"The FS hotel may not be the latest or trendiest in Singapore, but it may be the most thoughtful and intelligent. My family were well looked after during our recent stay with the hotel taking extra measures to ensure our comfort with our toddler. It was our first time overseas with her and the Four Seasons made it a lot easier with baby products unexpected but all provided. Service and luxury are all standard at this hotel as you would expect. ",5,,
Fantastic hotel,akshaykilachand,"What can I say-superb in every respect-class personified-rooms,service,cleanliness-concierge-location.food.All top class-well done team four seasons keep it up- no wonder its the best hotel in Singapore",5,,
Relaxing Birthday Stay with Family!,Rohitshenoy,"The property was extremely comfortable matched by top notch service.  They helped us start our 3 day journey off right with a very early check in straight from a red eye flight.  The redone rooms were exquisite in a minimalist way with a high floor view.  We just felt so at home, especially given the attention they gave to the comfort of our 2yr old.  Highly recommended for families with young children!",5,,
"Excellent service, amazing staff and beautiful hotel",LifeWorkTravel,It was an excellent service from check in all the way to check out. We enjoyed our stay. The staff are all attentive and helpful and ready to assist when need help. It was a beautiful short staycation for the family. The facilities are clean and sanitized at all times. It was pandemic so all precautionary measures are strictly adhere by staff and instructed guest to follow. We feel safe and enjoyed our staycation.,5,,
Luxury on Orchard,rickR1185WP,"Fantastic place to stay, when visiting Singapore. Quiet location, almost felt like on the outskirts, yet right in the heart of the city close to everything. Luxurious, but not as expensive as the other 5 star hotels on Marina Beach - still close to it all.",5,,
Exemplary customer care,scooter051,"The Four Seasons Hotel Singapore has  a customer care culture that is unique for a large hotel in my experience. From arrival, when the people at the door read your name  from the baggage tags and address you accordingly to reception where the formalities of check in are brief and fast, there  is a feeling that the hotel will go out of its way to ensure your comfort. If an advance check in has been made, you can go straight to your room. Rooms are spacious, spotless clean and serviced twice a day. Every request is promptly attended to. We needed extra water, and there were always plenty of bottles kept for us. A guest is welcomed back every time he goes out and returns, and the bar and restaurants go out of the way to provide what is asked for.  My wife celebrated her birthday during our stay,and it was so nice to receive a note from the maid wishing her in addition to the more usual cake and candles sent up from reception. Gladys, at the concierge desk was extremely helpful in arranging some special flowers for a friend‚Äôs birthday (which he really liked) and also in procuring hard to get reservations at a seafood restaurant to celebrate my wife‚Äôs birthday with friends. I have stayed here before on business trips but wanted my wife to experience the high standards of customer care the Four Seasons provide.  She was very impressed. This place makes you feel special.‚Ä¶",5,,
Excellent Hotel,Rob G,"On our last night of a Week staying here and if you are looking for a 5 star Hotel this is the one for you. Close to so many sights and attractions, not to mention bars and restaurants.  Their new Nobu restaurant is simply sublime and is a must when visiting. Outstanding service throughout the Hotel and they made our first visit to Singapore a special one.  Special mention for Giovanni Speciale for his exceptional customer service. Book now ",5,,
Excellent And Quiet Corner Of Orchard Road Area,Richard,"Pros : Excellent service, very good food & beverages, quiet corner of the busy Orchard Road area, very clean & well maintained hotel, true to its reputation and comfortable bed. Cons : Hotel compound is small, some distance from Orchard MRT and limited shopping in the hotel premises.",4,,
Pleasant stay,Satiawanlukas,"Staying here for 4 nights. Hotel is located in prime orchard location. Walking distance to hotel, mall and MRT station. Staff are nice, room is spacious, the staff and service was AMAZING. Will be back here for sure.  Room:  9/10 Cleanliness: 9/10 Location: 9/10 Staff and service: 10/10  Keep up the good work and what a pleasant stay :)",5,,
Nice Stay,MeganJetgirl,"Lovely hotel with great staff who were always attentive and happy to help. Rooms were spacious, modern and extremely clean with all the amenities you would expect from this type of hotel. Breakfast was a buffet in the restaurant with a large variety of hot and continental foods and juice. Snacks and beverages in the bar were good and room service was efficient and generous. The location was good and close to the shopping belt of Orchard Road.",4,,
Best venue to host a meeting in Singapore ,AlanCGK,This is by far the best venue to hold a meeting or a conference in Singapore rn. Michelle was a great coordinator and planner before the event. And Fandi was the best onsite person ever. The whole team was attentive and proactive to not just the guests but also the event crew. Everything went smooth as butter. Will definitely do more events in this hotel again.   ,5,,
Amazing Service!,Pratik,Such a pleasant stay. We moved here from a hotel in Sentosa and there was a day/night difference in the efficiency of the staff.  Rooms are large and have been updated recently I believe. Love the toiletries! The location is great and my kids had an amazing time. We had 2 rooms and loved that our room keys worked in either room - such a cool feature.  All good things - the key is the quality of their staff who are available to help at every turn.,5,,
Great property for the area.,Jeff-JTK-Tan,"The room was well designed with decor and fixtures to match the level expected in a prestigious hotel as Four Seasons. Attentive staff, good security features on the property and excellent food in the restaurant. This property has upped the ante, at least in my book, when it comes to choosing a hotel.",5,,
best of the best,soniaw753,"from the luxury amenities, carpet, beddings, automatic curtain, all the 7 stars standard, the royal suite room is exceptional big and very nice for entertaining friends and family. the location awesome just step away from orchard road. everything is luxurious from top to bottom. concierge service is excellent. very quiet at night.

Superb as usual,gbadit,"As usual one word for any four seasons property across the world ‚Äú superb ‚Äú. That‚Äôs all is needed to define our stay, the food, housekeeping etc etc etc.  The staff the hospitality is at par with the best in the world. Special mention for Taufiq at the concierge he really helped me with one of the issues with another hotel.",5,,
Wow!  An exceptional hotel in the heart of Singapore!,SANsna,"I stayed at Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore twice as bookends for my trip to Maldives.  My first stay was for 3 days and the second stay was for 1 day.  The Four Seasons was like a home away from home during my stay!  While it can be said that good service should be expected from any Four Seasons properties, I believe the staff here is a notch above.  Every interaction with the staff was starts with a smile and is incredibly pleasant.  You can see that they make an effort to remember every customer.  The staff at the breakfast buffet especially the host was exceptional.  With two kids, they made every effort to accommodate the kids and made sure they had their favorite cereals available every morning.  The location of the hotel is perfect in my opinion particularly for my short‚Ä¶",5,,
Best hotel in Singapore,IncaWood,"We have stayed in quite a few hotels in Singapore but this is our favorite.  The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and nice decor.  The lobby and lounge is elegant and soothing.  The location is perfect and there are great restaurants within walking distance.  But what makes this hotel stand apart is the staff, they are all gracious, helpful, cordial, helpful and the customer service is six stars.  We can‚Äôt thank the staff enough for the wonderful service.  For a Four Seasons in an expensive city the pricing is surprisingly  reasonable.   This is a five star hotel and not to be missed!",5,,
Wonderful stay at Four Seasons Singapore,sallytcf,"Truly enjoyed my stay here at FSS. I held my wedding here and I am very impressed by their service. They have wonderful facilities too. e.g. their gym is well-equipped, they have tennis courts, great swimming facilities and smart TVs in their spacious rooms. Widespread of delicious dishes too at their breakfast restaurant. Delicious in-room dining and super prompt service via their communication app. Strongly recommend everyone to stay here! ",5,,
Exceptional !!!,CHOPRAMO,"Four seasons Singapore is a truly exceptional hotel. Large rooms, exquisite washrooms, supremely comfortable beds, polite and prompt service and amazing attention to detail.  The breakfast is great if you are a non vegetarian and love cold cuts.  There is an ice machine on every floor which is super convenient.  The bathroom toiletries are L'occitane and the bathrooms are super comfortable and large.  The staff is very well trained and the customer service standards are really high.  It is a short walk from the famed Orchard road.   I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,,
"Fantastic, lovely, top notch! Best of the best as said by trip advisor and it‚Äôs true! Go to hotel in Singapore everytime",amu1817,"Brilliant stay coupled with great hospitable staff and wonderful service throughout. Great location, good ambience. Charles, nur, tuck, gladys and team were very kind to say the least! Will surely visit again. Shops and restaurants within walking distance",5,,
Charmed by the hospitality at Four Seasons Singapore,amitg1975,"We stayed three nights at Four Seasons Singapore with our twins aged 5, and we were completely charmed by the hospitality of this spectacular hotel.  The hotel is conveniently located on Orchard Boulevard and helped us easily access most places in Singapore.   There were so many little treats that we found there which gave us instant happiness.   To name a few: a welcome hamper, kiddo dental kit, kiddo slippers, kiddo bathrobes, stuffed toys on arrival, baby soap and shampoo. They loved it all.  The breakfast spread was excellent and on table service was great.   It was a pleasure staying at this hotel and we will definitely come again on our next trip! Thanks a lot, Four Seasons for making our Singapore stay special!",5,,
Best Decision,Phylippines,"This hotel has been wonderful. I literally just typed a whole paragraph of contentment and spent the last 20mins giving wonderful feedback to their survey questions. Service was just amazing. The rooms are elegant and widely spaced! Something you cannot get in newly built hotels these days. The attention to detail from check in to check out sets the bar so high. In my itinerary I planned to start breakfast by 8am and be on our way out the city by 9am but the sleep quality we had was just so good‚Äî we always end up sleeping in and getting up at 9am instead. Location wise, don‚Äôt get fooled in Google Maps that it‚Äôs away from the main Orchard Road, the hotel has an air conditioned connection to a mall and VOCO Hotel right smack Orchard Road. Trust my word for it, you won‚Äôt regret‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful stay,starfighter56,"My first time in Singapore in over 10 years. I decided to try the Four Seasons and it was a delightful stay from the very start. I was upgraded to a lovely room. Everything about this hotel is good, reception, the bar, doormen and the wonderful concierge team who re as lly helped me out when s slight crisis occured. The only negative remark was the breakfast service with highly stressed staff and not at the same standard as at the bar. All in all a terrific stay.",5,,
Perfect stay in singapore,quintanf319,From beginning to end the hotel catered to all my requests. I truly enjoyed my stay here. So many things to say that I put in already in my suggestions but I have to say attention to detail is amazing.  One amazing example is I went for a long run outside of the hotel. And as I was returning the hotel doorman gave me a cold drink. This level of attention is really amazing.   The best thing was the stuff. ,5,,
Four seasons is a cut above the rest. Perfect location and excellent service,ramby,"The rooms are superb. Every detail is magnificent. I love the layout. The bathroom itself is like a dream. Most of all, I love the service. The concierge team is very efficient and prompt and responsive. I will never stay anywhere else in Singapore. I stayed here for 10 days with my wife and 3 kids. Hats off tor Sherwan of concierge for handling all my reservations including the antigen tests for flying out of Singapore.",5,,
Pleasant stay,MixyMix,"The hotel is located near orchard road. You have to walk a bit until you find the main orchard area and it's not close to any MRT station. So I can't say it convinient. But if you travel by taxi it would be convinient and easy to get taxi.   The hotel is a bit dated but room got renovated and so comfy. Breakfast was a bit too average and not so many variety, i can say a bit disappointed.    Every staffs were polite , four seasons standard. Got a promo for 3 pay 2 and it was very worth. Nevery doubt to come back again.",5,,
Amazing experience and sure to come back for,apim,"If we stay at Singapore for travel from Oz to anywhere, we used to choose Marina Bays Sands usually. This was the first time we stayed here and we felt so good that we will definitely be back here. The hotel fits all standard necessary checklists for 5 star, however, the experience is made special by staff. I rarely had such a good experience with staff while having breakfast... Charlie was phenomenally good and friendly with our toddlers. Overall, a way more warm hospitality experience. Finally, on the last day, as we had late night flights, reception easily extended our stay without fuss for half day.",5,,
This is the worst Four Seasons Hotel we have ever stayed at.,bigballer62,"Stay clear of this one. This is a Super 8 dressed up as a Four Seasons. Staff was confused and rude and very inexperienced. Concierge had no local knowledge whatsoever, he/she sent us to closed restaurants, closed attractions, it was absolutely unacceptable. Hotel condition was run down, paint on the door hinges, towel rack wobbling on the wall, toilet seat crooked, dated furnishings, stains of our sofa, the list goes on and on. Waste of money. Only thing going for it is the location in Orchard. This hotel and how we were treated there has made us not want to return to Singapore.",1,,
Lacking the personal touch,vidhusagar,"It's a great hotel , lovely location and amenities. Room sizes, bath and sleep quality were perfect.  But somehow lacks the personal touch and bereft of the warmth that you would usually associate with a hotel of this class.  Was left to wonder until we asked about facilities, they had a great restaurant but got to know too late. Not being picky but just that one would expect a better level of service with a hotel this class. ",3,,
Unremarkable stay,SagarVS,"Check in time was 3 pm and they could not accomodate me even 15 minutes before that despite the fact that half the rooms were empty. Also when we checked in there was no introduction to services available at the Hotel. No one came with us to the room to brief us about the facilities either. There were a lot of smiles and gestures but there was no warmth is what i felt. There was no personal touch in the room either. No fruit, not even a simple cookie and thats surprising for a hotel of this standard.  With great reluctance they extended our check out by 90 minutes. The door men are courteous and efficient. There is nothing in this property that will take me back there again.",3,,
Exceptional Hotel - Perfect Stay!,Krydon,"What separates this hotel from the rest is the exceptional staff. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, my wife & I felt special every step of the way. Facilities are super clean & have of touch of class about them. Location of property on Orchard Boulevard is near perfect as it‚Äôs situated near Ion Shopping Complex & MRT. We will definitely be returning to stay at Four Seasons Singapore when next visiting!

Feb 2022 Valentines Day + Pawcation,Naresh Kumar,"Stayed from 12th feb - 14th feb with my partner and his dog. Superb suite. Lovely pet amenities and great service from hotel staffs The view wasn't that great as it was facing the construction site but the room was big enough for our furkid to run and move about, which made us to forget the view Nice breakfast - we had it at outdoor area. Maybe a suggestion - possible for to make netted fences to prevent birds coming to the outdoor dining area. I realised our dogs and few other dog owners felt abit uncomfy for the birds keep coming in which disturb our breakfast time.  Otherwise, a very nice hotel ",4,,
Heaven,Fathur,"The most best hotel's in singapore,excellent service and i recommend the couples to come here! Very comfortable and the spa is so relaxing ,i love the view from the swimming pool and the buffet are super good",5,,
"Standout service with a luxurious, quiet, ambience.",mostlyharmless,"Four Seasons hotel ranks high in the listings, and it isn't immediately apparent why. From the outside and in certain areas (e.g. the pool areas), the hotel is a little dated. However, all areas are immaculately maintained, while some public areas are currently under renovation and likely to be refreshed. Throughout the public areas, flower arrangements and the decor gives a garden-like atmosphere, somewhat akin to the Botanic Gardens. The bedrooms (recently renovated) are refreshingly comfortable and luxurious, without being ostentatious. Rooms are generally quiet (occasionally noise from neighbouring rooms), beds are comfortable, and capsule coffee provided. Views from the room are generally nothing to write home about, sadly. The standout has to be the service - turndown‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful!,TibbyMum,Beautiful hotel with a lovely relaxed feel. Delicious food and a pretty outdoor terrace to eat or have a drink on. Staff were wonderful with nothing being too much trouble. Special mention to Karen and the rest of the pool team who made our days at the poolside very relaxing and comfortable. Housekeeping were excellent and the room was always spotless. We will definitely return.,5,,
Definitely one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore!,s.s,"I never thought I‚Äôd try a Four Seasons.. In Singapore, specifically! The room was every bit elegant and modern as you‚Äôd expect from the brand.  The king sized bed was heavenly, the most comfortable that I have ever encountered ‚Äì extremely fluffy!   Bathroom amenities are from L‚Äôoccitane, which is always a plus point! The bathtub also came pre filled with some rose petals. Turn down service in the evening was very kind. Came back from dinner and was surprised with a little cake :)",5,,
So classy,PatrickTerenceLim,"This is such a classy hotel.  Besides the beautiful ambiance, the service received at the entrance elevated the morning.  Felt it from the doorman who walked me to the lift to the service staff that served me the coffee.  I was treated like a prince.",5,,
Simply awesome!,Jerico,"Celebrating our 20th wedding anniversray here at Four Seasons Orchard Singapore and I cant wait to write my commendation. So here is a quick one. The service is beyond awesome. Ellie, Karen, Sanjay, and Fal, are all friendly and super accomodating. The hotel remembers our big day and quite sincere in making our celebration a memorable one. Room is great. Food is worth it.",5,,
Four words: I will be back!,Josbel,"Thank you Gladys, Jane, Raymond, Mun Yee and Shou Wei for making our experience so memorable. Tip top service with a smile and we will definitely be back. We were given personalised and efficient check in and we were sad to check out. Breakfast was delicious and was promptly seated and taken care of despite the queue and crowd. Always nice to be greeted by name and recognised when we were on a celebratory staycation. Very professional service by the banquet team. We appreciated the extra mile gone for us as well as flexibility and patience extended to us.",5,,
"Service, service, service. And the bed",Ric C,"I could tell you many things to love about the Four Seasons. I could share that the rooms are huge and sumptuous, with the smallest rooms already coming in at almost 50 sqm. I could talk about the high quality breakfast that greeted us each morning at One-Ninety. I could also touch on the wonderful location, right in Orchard (with a two minute walk to Wheelock Place) but yet blissfully cocooned from all the hustle and bustle. ¬†¬†  Instead, I am just going to focus on the two things that set this hotel apart from the pack. All five-star hotels pride themselves on service. But the Four Seasons has not only taken it to another level, they have pretty much perfected it I feel. It is not just the warm smiles that greet you throughout the hotel. You actually see the staff going lengths‚Ä¶",5,,
Impressive,ssinaya,"One of the best rooms we had stayed in. Was large and comfortable. Can't with coffee machine and a wireless Bose speaker which we used often in the morn and evening wind downs. Special mention of their bath room, which was large and impressive.   Housekeeping, room service, reception were all prompt and good in their service. Really enjoyed our stay and look forward to visiting again. ",5,,
Great hotel to explorer Singapore,narikhimani,Excellent service and good location. Clean and efficient - everything you need for a business trip (and holiday). Located near the MRT and close to shopping destination. Great roof top pool and chill out area. ,5,,
Travel during VTL,cyam12,"I travelled to Singapore from Melbourne via the VTL, with my daughter. The 4 Season hotel made this a wonderful experience. They provided inexpensive ART (RAT) tests for us and made booking anything easy with their app via the chat link. Both the pools were lovely and we were given extra time to use these facilities. Room service was great as was the bar for cocktails and satays. ION shopping mall is a short stroll and has a fantastic food court on B4 level. Check in and out were uncomplicated and all the staff were efficient and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for all VTL travellers.",5,,
Different experience on every stay,Tiffany D,I stay several hotel but didn't experience confusing upon check out day. Need check thru apps n call front desk to ensure didn't over the timing. Poor experience on second times although hotel is really comfortable to stay. When enjoy breakfast is nobody to let you know what to do n which selection you may consider. Maybe first stay experience on Four season is too wonderful so I expectation high. Although second trip need worth $600+ but is not worthy when I choose between Four Season n Mandarin Oriental Hotel choice.,3,,
Amazing food and Cocktails!!!!,Anjana B,"We visited the Chinese restaurant in Four Seasons Singapore twice.   As a family we had dinner on 31st December 2021 . Loved the delicious food and amazing cocktails. The staff were so accommodating, friendly and polite catering to all our wishes. We enjoyed the dinner so much that decided to go for lunch on 16th January 2022 again. It was our daughters birthday so we had a celebratory lunch! As usual the staff made us so welcome and fussed around our daughter. Would recommend this restaurant to everyone!",5,,
Pleasant Surprise - Top Notch Service,BTSE,Celebrated wedding anniversary with plenty of positives from the hotel. This is the first time at this hotel chain and indeed the service is top notch. Decoration and setup of the room was impressive even with less than 48 hours notification. Response from hotel was swift and quick.  Room service (food) at 1am was also impressive.   Highly recommended for anyone who wants to impressed their partner.,5,,
Service is exceptional as usual,Salim N,"Hotel is near the shops of Orchard Road.  Ad you'd expect hotel has great spacious and clean rooms, the gym facilities are lovely  (as is pool area).  The differentiator with other five stars - is the service - the service at other places is great  -but the four seasons does it just slightly better - they anticipate what you want before you ask  - they follow up ideal queries - they notice that you have a gluten intolerance (wife) and make sure that gluten free alternative are on hand.",5,,
Best stay in Singapore,angExplorer,"After 32 unique hotel stays in Singapore, I am glad to have chosen Four Seasons as my last stay for 2021 with 2 nights over the Christmas weekend. I would probably rank this as my best stay in Singapore.   Despite being the busiest weekend of the year, the service was flawless from front desk, telephone operator, mobile chat, F&B to housekeeping. The service in One Ninety was perfect from breakfast service to dinner service. I accidentally left my jacket at One Ninety after check out and this was kept with security for me to pick up a few days later.  Mobile app and mobile chat was flawlessly integrated and ensured a seamless stay. There was unfortunately no names on the mobile chat for consistency, but I would really like to send my compliments to them.  Lastly, I like to‚Ä¶",5,,

"Second time, remains pretty faultless",LucyHSG,"We stayed for  special occasion, 2 adults and 1 6 year old. They arranged for a high floor, extra bed and extra kids toiletries without prompting, and every staff member we met was delightful and did their best to provide a personal experience. Remains a hotel worth the extra spend.",5,,
Good experience with the staffs and mobile app,oskarpeh,"I We had enjoyed our stay in Four Seasons Singapore. Firstly, thanks for the complimentary cake after knowing my birthday. Secondly thanks for specially arranged an extra bed for my daughter. We didn‚Äôt really expect and had prepared to sleep together on the king size bed. Thirdly, thanks for taking the extra to get my daughter an extra set of toiletries that include a kid toothbrush and toothpaste. This was something special that we didn‚Äôt expected and were grateful that you had prepared all these after I had messaged in the app messenger about my birthday and my daughter.

Staycaytion,Ken T,"The hotel offers excellent view of Orchard Road as we selected the Boulevard City View Room. Amenities provided by the hotels in the room were top notch, the king size bed was comfortable, the rain showers in the room were refreshing.

Outstanding stay as VTL travelers,jrs,"My family of 4 spent 9 nights at the Four Seasons over the holiday break, as VTL travelers from the United States. It was a truly great stay. As others have noted in their reviews, the service at the hotel is absolutely exceptional. Every single person we interacted with was warm, helpful, and kind. We had interesting conversations with so many of the folks at the hotel, who shared recommendations about places to see and eat. The concierge and front desk staff were incredibly responsive - we loved being able to ask questions via the app. We particularly appreciated the fact that despite our 7 AM arrival at the hotel to quarantine after our flight (while awaiting our PCR results), we were not charged for an additional day. The rooms are luxurious and very very comfortable -‚Ä¶",5,,
Staycation,The happytraveller,"Good experience staying there as they fulfilled my expectations. Food was splendid and staff were polite, friendly and ever ready to render assistance.

My Stay in Four Seasons Hotel,Go18159316893,"This is not my first stay in Four Seasons Hotel for my family of 5, in fact it‚Äôs my 4th or 5th stayed. The reason was due to its pets friendly.

Our Favorite Hotel!,scartay08,"This is the best room I stayed in in all the hotels I‚Äôve been to. The room and bathroom were huge! The bed, pillows were very comfortable and It made me wanna stay in the room the whole time. I love the bathroom it felt very luxurious.

There‚Äôs not much option but as I mentioned in my other review, this seems to be the norm in all hotels during pandemic. Even so, I love the food especially the breads and coffee. Service is also superb! One disappointment is the in room dining. There‚Äôs not much options so we ordered local food.

Great experience!,Nomad78796,Great experience! Love the Four Seasons App with the Chat function. They really make the effort to respond asap. Little ones are well taken care of. Much attention to details. Appreciate. Love the One-Ninety restaurant too. Also discovered the linkway from Four Seasons to Hilton. Will always appreciate the service from Four Seasons. Thanks!,5,,
Great Xmas stay!,trvkaki,"Four Seasons, from the point you stepped into the hotel till the point of check out, is top notch.  The checking in and out at the front desk is fast and efficient while the housekeeping team is polite.  The room appeared to be renovated and kept up to pace with technology such as having usb points. It is also easy to book the pool through the messenger app where everything is made so convenient.  If I was to nitpick, these are the areas that Four Seasons could probably work on. - My kiddo found a m&m lodged within the sofa but I don‚Äôt think it is any fault of the housekeeping unit since it is not easily spotted. - The drainage inlet of the shower cubicle could have been bigger or it could have been struck. Over the two nites we were there, we were essentially showering with our‚Ä¶",5,,
Christmas Staycation ,Jason,Definitely a great place to have a Christmas Staycation especially with the vintage decor and Christmas Tree that put you straight into the holiday season mood and let's you feel like you are in overseas  Great service and warm hospitality.

Hope to see improvement on their staff ,4,,
Well maintained hotel and great location!,kerri,"Well maintained hotel!   I have never consider staying at four seasons considering the number of years it has been around. But COVID and Christmas gave us a chance since we had tried most of the hotel around the vicinity.   Upon walking in, hotel smell nice and was well maintained throughout. I had very low expectations of the room but it surpasses me! I asked for an extra bed for our toddler and they also placed kids amenities around. Very nice touch!   Overall, we are very pleased and will consider staying again for the price and location! Well done for keeping such a old building so well kept!",5,,
what an amazing stay yet again,Carmen L,"There is no comparison. The service that you get at Four Seasons always makes you feel cared for and that your interests come first. ""Welcome back again."" And indeed that's how I was made to feel throughout my stay. They always accommodate your requests and there's a latent trust always in their guests - no need to show the email as proof that you did a pool booking, no need to inform of your room number when asking for a carpark coupon. It just made my stay so much more pleasant and easy. All their staff are exceptional! The room came ready with extra bed, the toilet and bathtub¬† (huge by any standard) all spotlessly clean! No stray hairs on the floor or marks on the linen or stains in the toilet. A request for late checkout is granted even when they have to turnaround the room‚Ä¶",5,,

Classic luxury with 5-star service,bweebschan,"It's been a long while since I posted a review, but my recent stay at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore deserves a mention.   I was initially apprehensive that the hotel would be old and dated, though I already heard good things about the service. Glad to share that while the hotel isn't new, modern or flashy, it has retained its classic and luxurious appeal, with the common areas always  quiet and peaceful despite running at full capacity. The hotel rooms have been recently refurbished and are lovely. Modern but well styled but Peranakan touches, the deluxe room and the bathroom were spacious, comfortable and spotless. Probably the highest hotel bed I've seen , and also one of the more comfortable. I requested for firmer pillows and they were delivered to the room promptly.   Which‚Ä¶",5,,

Staycay in SG,SeahKC,"Hotel is situated just on the fringe of the orchard shopping belt. Lobby is very elegant and grand, service by the front desk was fast and professional. Managed to check in within 15mins and was given a room on the 13th floor.  Room was of good size, reminds me of a slightly smaller version of the valley wing.  Bed and pillow was very soft and so for table. If soft wasn‚Äôt your cup of tea, can choose another from the pillow menu.  Bathroom is big with separate standing shower and bath tub. Amenities  were well stocked and of good quality.

Best staycation ever,24davidmartin,"Stayed 3nights, hotel gave us an extra bed for my 4yr old son at no extra cost. They also gave him his own kids toiletries and even a small care pack with some goodies.   Pros: Kids friendly, pet friendly, easily accessible and ample F&B options nearby. Friendly staff added that personal touch which made us feel unique and not as if we were just another guest.  Cons: bed was too soft, which we told the staff after our 1st night and they worked some magic on it making it much better on our 2nd and 3rd night.",5,,

She also acknowledged my request for my Prosecco to be delivered to the room at a certain timing. I experienced a minor hiccup with a reservation benefit but it was instantly resolved by the same front desk staff.  The room, including the bathroom was nicely furnished. The bed was so comfortable, it's probably one of the best hotel beds that I've came acrossed. There's at least three type-C and standard USB plugs in the room so there is no need to bring the charger head. Overall, the room atmosphere is very comfortable‚Ä¶",5,,
Great service!,Scher M,"VG service! Check in was seamless. I requested for late check out upon check in and was asked until what time was I requesting. My request for late check out was confirmed right away. We opted for the Premier room and was impressed, the room is lovely and spacious and comes with daybed. The pools were so so but it's ok. We were surprised that the breakfast is not an ala carte buffet type but a normal buffet. The options were limited but food quality is great. We loved the bak kut teh.  They even have a coffee machine that has great coffee options like capuccino, latte, flat white, near the  check in counters where one can just take coffee at their convenience. We were impressed and will highly recommend Four Seasons hotel for your staycay.",5,,

We had Beef Short Rib and Roasted Seabass with Avocado Salad and Mushroom Soup for sides. The dinner was excellent, and loved their unique and delicious bread which was baked fresh with the accompanying  ‚Äúbread sticks‚Äù stuck to the side.

I would stay here again and give you another try as I love the FS brand.   Couplef postives to mention: Gabrielle at the bar was fantastic, its not easy to be in your element when government restrictions mean bars are empty, so his ability to stay focused is a real asset to the hotel. Similarly, Raychelle at the concierge is an angel, everything i asked, she had an absolute smile and helped with to her fullest. Beds of course were comfortable. Staff were absolutely 10/10.

However the coffee machine in the room was producing dirty cloudy coffee water when I tried to used it. Not sure how it's been maintained. The TV was huge. We were able to mirror our Apple devices and watched YouTube/Safari videos. Netflix is not possible though.  Restaurant had limited choices for breakfast. The food was alright.

The location of the hotel is good, tucked away at Orchard Boulevard, overseeing the canopy of trees and lush greenery, truly the phrase ""Garden City"" becomes larger-than-life and it was clearly demonstrated during our stay. And yet, it is just a short stroll away to the glistening shopping belt of Orchard Road, either through the path road alongside Orchard Boulevard or through the LINKWAY to Orchard Road/Tanglin Road.

She really defined the experience for us, and made us want to return to Four Seasons many times!  We also really enjoyed having afternoon tea and drinks at the One Ninety Bar - the staff were very friendly.",5,,
Central location. Easy access to shopping malls nearby.,aros845,"Excellent hotel. Provides a classy atmosphere and a more private set up. Good for business, couples or with family too. I think the pillow needs to be a little more comfy (hard) rather than too softy. It will be awesome if the Hotel can provide spread of Halal breakfast too. :) ..Hopefully in the near future...",5,,
Babymoon,Ken S,"Love the decor. Amazing service from the staff.  We were here for our babymoon and wanted a night of good sleep without being disturbed by our cats. Four Seasons emailed us and we told them it was going to be a babymoon for us. They did some art on the windows and gave us an amazing cake. Staff also took the initiative to provide a maternity pillow for my wife.  Upon check in, lobby staff assisted to make a dinner reservation for us at the Michellin-starred restaurant Jiang-Nan Chun. We went up and were pleasantly surprised at the size of our room as well as the additional touches the staff put in for us.  Dinner at Jiang-Nan Chun was superb.  I managed to try out the in-room dining for supper and ordered a bolognese. Standard fare and I thorougly enjoyed it BUT could be a BIT‚Ä¶",5,,
Happy Birthday Staycation,M Flo,"This stay was for my father's birthday celebration. We had a wonderful stay in the one-bedroom suite (thank you FS for the upgrade!).   Room was extremely spacious and well-kept. The staff noted that it was a birthday celebration and placed a cake as well as decorations around the room.   The Four Seasons app is also very helpful and responsive to our requests.   We were able to secure an early check-in as well as a late check-out. Right from the start, we received a warm welcome from the staff and it has left a lasting impression on all of us. We look forward to future stays at other FS properties too!",5,,
Congratulations to the Four Seasons Team in Singapore!,egg1421,"There are many pet-friendly hotels in Singapore but we decided on Four Seasons due to the pleasant experience back in Oct 2020. We love the warmth that was extended to our Furkid. The team treated our Furkid with respect and took care of her needs, providing her with a personalized towel, bed and bowls for food and water. Hence, the decision was pretty clear when we were deciding on another staycation. We booked a one-bedroom suite with our family of four from 27th to 28th March. All was great from the point of check in till we settled down in our room. In the evening, we realized that the toilet flush was not working properly and informed the hotel. The maintenance team came by promptly and cleared the choke and all was good. In the next hour or so, we received a call from the‚Ä¶",5,,
Birthday Staycation,Bibi,"We stayed in Four Seasons last November 2020 and because of our very pleasant experience, we chose to stay here again to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was very thoughtful to put up some birthday decorations in our hotel room, provide early check-in, late check-out and a complimentary room upgrade to a room facing Orchard. On the day of my actual birthday, they provided a cake and even the housekeeping left a birthday message and token on the bed. Almost all of the hotel staff I saw at the lobby greeted me and addressed me by my first name. It was a very nice gesture.  Everything was great. The check-in and check-out process was efficient and quick. It took us less than 5 minutes. Gladys asssisted us upon check out. They also get your preferences on housekeeping timing and‚Ä¶",5,,
A very pleasant staycation for hubby's birthday,Joyce C,"We've been planning for a staycation in Four Seasons for the longest time, since we know it's one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore. When we had the chance, we grabbed it immediately. We booked a Deluxe room. Since it was a weekday, we had most of the amenities to ourselves and we received personalised service. We were welcomed by the warmest front desk staff, Azme and Tuck, their guest experience manager. Everybody was so helpful.   As we reached our room, we were surprised with birthday decor and welcome gifts. Thank you very much! Really appreciate it. The room was spacious.

She was fast in her response and on the day of arrival, she was so warm and welcoming. Ms Yanlin Tan did our check-in and she too was very warm and welcoming. Our check-in was done thoroughly but swift. During check-out Miku was there to bid us goodbye. She was so sincere that it felt like saying goodbye to a friend. Thank You Miku!

Anniversary Staycation,Mia Joo,"We had a very lovely 2-night stay with our pet dog at Four Seasons Singapore. The room is very clean, spacious and luxurious. The bed is extremely comfortable and great to lounge in and watch TV. The staff are very kind and sincere, especially the reception manager, Yanling Tan, who made us feel so welcomed with her genuine and gracious service. They treated our dog like a family member and we respect them for that. The buffet breakfast may not be a huge spread but each item is cooked well and is delicious, with great coffee and tea, and that's way better than a huge spread of average food. Altogether, an excellent, memorable stay for us.",5,,
Great Weekend Getaway,Dee,"To celebrate our belated graduation that was cancelled due to Covid, we went on a girls staycation and chose Four Seasons. Though we booked from Klook, we were very pleasantly surprised by the care and attention that the reservations agent Gladys provided - she was very attentive to our requests for a high floor and also made sure to include extras such as complimentary early check-in, a card to celebrate our graduation, along with a cake which we didn't expect. It was truly a kind gesture.   The Premier Queen room was marvelous. It's spacious, just nice for the three of us, and the high floor gave a really great view of the skyline!

The hotel also arranged my for my breakfast to be delivered to the room. It was a nice gesture. We had our breakfast at the restaurant on the second day and was pleasantly surprised that the usual buffet spread is still available.

"Massive rooms, excellent service",chrismenon,"Our two main takeaways from this staycation was how massive the rooms were, and how personable the service is. Let's just say that the Four Seasons Singapore is hiring all the right people, because we were very impressed with all the staff we interacted with - Yani from the operator, Jean, Gigi and Alex from front office, Chenin from the spa, and more. Thank you to Aisyah for arranging the late checkout for us also...!   We were shocked at how generous the layout of the rooms are, absolutely no space was spared in the design. I daresay that these are among the largest guest rooms in the Singapore 5 star hotel scene.",5,,
Excellent staycation,fujiapple79,"Great guest rooms. Excellent service from hotel staff.

Love this hotel so much,JHC,"Four Seasons hotel does not shine among the list of luxury hotels in Singapore, losing out to newcomers and famous locations such as the MBS, RWS chain (more so Equarius Hotel), Westin, etc. However, my stay at Four Seasons was so pleasant that I am definitely returning. Their standard rooms are large at 49m2 - it has a very comfortable king sized bed with the hotel's signature bedding; a lounge sofa beside the window for lazy afternoons; a 55"" smart TV that is linked to a speaker set-up for surround sound in the room and bathroom; an additional BOSE speaker; full marble bathroom with everything you would expect from a 5-star hotel (including a male-and-female wash basin, and a bidet that isn't featured often in hotels).

I don't think I will come back if the rest of the stays are just as bad. Really spoilt the staycation even before it started. But I must give compliment to one particular staff by the name of Jean.

As we were celebrating a few things, we were greeted with several cards, a gorgeous marble cake and a platter of delicious light bites.   Check-in and check-out were seamless. Delighted to discover that we were truly in the heart of Orchard Road - just a short walk to Wheelock Place but still private and closed off from the main traffic.

"the Gym is amazing! (and of course, the room)",Wilfred T,"Among all the local hotels which I have stayed, I dare say that Four Seasons Hotel has the best gym amongst all. In my list, Ritz Carlton's ranks second. Haven't found a third yet cos Conrad, Pan Pacific, St Regis, Capella and MBS's gym ain't even close.  The room is definitely comfortable and I liked how the toilet also has ceiling speaker installed. You are definitely not missing out in the show if you have to be in the toilet. Also, there's Airplay capability in the room TV, something which many others do not have. Breakfast wise, not as great as St Regis's but not too bad.  Overall, really amazing property.

Absolutely the best in Singapore ,Sharada Qureshi,"My husband and I just spent a lovely week at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore and have nothing but good things to say. We have stayed in many luxe hotels around the world and ultimately, a great experience at any hotel comes down to their people, the quality of their service and the F&B.   The Four Seasons team in Singapore, right from the front desk to their restaurants were super warm, friendly and went the extra mile to make it a special experience for us. The attention to detail was amazing. I forgot my mousepad and was using a book... the housekeeping team noticed that and just got a mousepad organized for my laptop with a little note. They remember your name and your food and drink preferences. We had a bit of a roof leak situation in our room and they were very quick‚Ä¶",5,,
Fab,Sunbedguy,"Stayed here for a much needed break from parenting. Not an obvious choice amongst the many staycay hotels but will definitely return. The rooms are recently refurbished so are well appointed, high quality tv's, good beds, decent coffee machine etc. The gym is excellent, obviously also a members health club but no issues there as that always means the gyms are well managed as opposed to being a token hotel gym. The hotel is deceptively big, you would never know it as you drive past, two swimming pools, two tennis courts etc. I have stayed at other four seasons and all are excellent, this is no exception. Other brands might claim to be premium in Singapore but this truly is. I will return for my next staycay.   Minor suggestion, consider making the downstairs pool the family pool‚Ä¶",5,,

As we have a baby girl, Four Seasons communicated with us before our arrival to find out her age so that they can make the necessary arrangements - eg provided some diapers, baby wash and even a thoughtful diaper bin. Of course, because it was a birthday staycation the cake was already set up in the room during our check in. In addition the staff were all very accommodating to our requests during the stay. We had three staycations since hotels opened for staycation in Singapore and Four Seasons hands down had the best service.

Excellent service! ,Shan Abellaneda,"Its our first time in a 4 seasons property and we splurged a bit and stayed here for 3 nights since covid doesnt allow overseas travel. Excellent customer service! The hospitality industry is suffering during this pandemic yet u can see how the staff are trying their best to make ur stay exceptional. You can chat with the property via FB messenger and they are super quick to reply and take action. Things like if u order food from outside, they will send it to ur room even without u asking. When u go out, just message them and ur room is clean when u get back. When u swim, they will come to give towels, cold drinks and even free dessert at times. These are small things that make ur stay luxurious and relaxing.   My only rant is that the pools are very outdated but anyway the‚Ä¶",5,,
Flawless,khobby,"As a change of scenery we chose the Four Seasons for a last minute staycation and it didn't disappoint. From check in to check out, every interaction was friendly and efficient. The newly refurbished rooms with a Peranakan feel were spacious, clean and comfortable. ",5,,
"Excellent hotel with amazing rooms, staff and location",Coolsock,Loved every single moment of my 3 nights stay. All staff were very friendly and hospitable. The rooms and bathrooms are so spacious. Especially loved the l'occitane toiletries! Such an enjoyable and pleasant stay. Can't wait to be back again!,5,,
Excellent Choice ,Edmund,"Due to the COVID19 situation, many Singaporeans have been trapped and unable to travel. When staycations were allowed a month ago, I completed 3... One at the Capitol Kempinski, one at the St Regis and the last one at the Four Seasons. Of the 3 places I have stayed, the Four Seasons is definitely my favourite! From the exterior, The Four Seasons looks the most dated. How wrong I was!!! It‚Äôs not the cheapest but the service standards and comfort in the hotel is truely outstanding. Highly recomended! ",5,,
Very good tea time spot- Excellent service!,Boum-Bour L,"I went to the 4 seasons bar for a tea time with a girl friend. The Bar is really comfy and nicely decorated, I loved the fact that the decoration is luxurious and the ambiance very quite and suitable for a girly chit chat. The tea time comes with sparkling teas, regular drinks and savoury/sweet mignardises. I didnt try much of the sparkling teas as I am not a bubbles fan but my friend highly enjoyed it. My white tea was delicious as was the mocha (strong and cors√© like I prefer it).  The food was very tasty and offered plenty of choices, I particularly loved the truffle eggs sandwich as well as the chocolate financier (would have loved to have more of these!), the scones were very well cooked and the rose strawberries jam was a nice perfect combination for the warm scones.

Exceptional,ChrisL_Singapore,"My wife and I had been to the Four Seasons Singapore for a number of conferences, so we knew the high standards to expect when we book a brief staycation for her birthday. Happy to report the hotel exceeded our already lofty expectations.   Highly recommended!   The customer service was exceptional: friendly and caring without being overbearing. Several special touches in honor of her birthday, and (I suppose because occupancy was presumably on the low side) an upgrade to the 1-br suite. The room was outstanding: clean, comfortable, spacious (of course). The breakfast in the restaurant was a bit pricey as you'd expect, but quite tasty.  Decor and artwork and lighting throughout the hotel were subdued and classy. The family pool on the top floor was small but comfy and great‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful Stay,Vacationer1966,"Our family stayed for 5 days at this property from 3 to 7 August. We took a suite connecting to a boulevard room. As our home was under renovation during this period, and we had to bring our dog with us, we were very happy that Four Seasons accommodated us as our understanding is that it is a dog friendly hotel.  Our stay was very comfortable and we were made to feel very much at home. No request was turned away by the staff. There are too many of them to compliment but we would like to especially mention Yen Ling who arranged our stay, and who graciously allowed us a little more time to check out as our renovations were not complete. We also compliment Tuck Wah who responded quickly to our feedback.   Room wise, the beds are luxurious and very comfy, and relatively large in‚Ä¶",5,,
One of the best in Singapore ,MRMOLLER,"Love this wonderful hotel and their staff - you really feel at home and taken so well care off . Beautifull rooms , great bar and excellent dining . Easy access to everything and just feels so good when you return .  Will definitely return at my next visit ",5,,
Great food quality and Ambiance!,Mskfan03,This hotel ambiance is superb! I love eating dinner here as I can eat good food and relax at the same time! Their pizza is great! As well as my favorite crab pasta! The dessert and salad buffet is a good setting idea. I would love to dive in with those different types of cheese.   I miss eating there! Will dine in for sure when we have the chance!,4,,
Really good,Ho Cong Thanh,"The place is really clean and have a bar at the first foor, the room is big enough for one person if go on business, from that place really easy to call an Taxi or go to the MRT station, Bus Station...",5,,
Great location,Antonia Hoetami,"Always my go-to option for staycation due to its location (I love hitting the bar during happy hour, enjoying house brew and the river view) but this time is a little different staycation than usual. I came because my travel plan got cancelled. It‚Äôs rather quiet during this period but that‚Äôs somewhat better because I got more personalized assistance and care from the staffs. Amrul (or Amirul?) on front desk has been kind and upgraded my room. I got 18th floor, the view is much better than my apartment and that‚Äôs exactly what I needed, a change of view after many weeks working from home. The staffs at Eatery resto are also nice and spent time to have quick chat with me. I really appreciate the warm gesture especially during this stay. Guess I‚Äôll see myself back here during Easter‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful Stay,Lance H,"I am picky about giving out five stars, and I probably would have given them five stars apart from one thing: I simply didn't stay here long enough to try everything and enjoy it.  So it is a solid four!  I checked in late and things went smoothly.  My suite was perfect with a good view.  I walked around the hotel, looking around and was impressed with what I saw.  In the morning, I had breakfast and the service was good as was the food.  I have absolutely no complaints and I look forward to staying here again.",4,,
Great service but far from everything,lcf2001,"The Four Seasons in Singapore is an older property.  The style of the building, the shape of rooms, etc are all from the 80'.   The service is the usual from FS, ie; very good. The only downside was arriving from a 25 hour flight, only to find the hotel bar closing early (basically in our face). They really should rethink this. A lot of the clientele arrive late at night and having a glass of wine would have been appreciated.  The roof top pool is very clean, but lacks charm. A few chaise longue, few plants and that's it.   The absolute best part of the hotel is breakfast. It is the BEST breakfast buffet I have experience in the world. No words can do it justice.   Lastly, note that hotel is not downtown. It's further north, in a nice shopping area. But you're not at all where‚Ä¶",3,,
Amazing stay - highly recommend!,Elena L,"Service is awesome, highly recommend. Very detailed and very attentive. We have a 3 year old daughter with us, and everyone was very accommodating, from offering stroller for us to use, opening doors for us and opening elevators for us as our daughter is napping, from extending our check out to accommodate one more nap. Breakfast service was amazing, remembered our preferences, including tea options. Pool service was great. Room was wonderful and clean and housekeeping done twice a day with no issues. Tent was also given as play for our daughter, with balloons and treats as welcome. Our daughter loved it. Thank you Four Seasons!!",5,,
Outstanding hotel,paullord,"Stayed for three nights together with my wife. Both agreed it‚Äôs the best hotel experience of our lives. Hotel is high end, and the staff are all professional and super helpful.  Rooms are great, with a really comfortable bed. Bathrooms are modern.  Breakfast we enjoyed very much, and had recommended local dish each day.  Location is great for Orchard road shopping, and it a short taxi ride to Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and other attractions.  A lot of choice in Singapore. We are so happy we chose the Four Seasons and will definitely be back. ",5,,
Great staffs but the room is not the best,Kuma K,"First time for Four Seasons SG. The location is great, not far from Orchard. The room reminds me of Four Seasons HK, the layout is quite the same.  The bed is comfortable but the thing i dislike is the air-condition. It is quite hot. Although I try to adjust it to the lowest 19C, it is still not cool enough (That trip I stay at Ritz and Raffles before Four Seasons, so I know that it is not the degree I wanted it to be).  And the room has some smell, it is not bad smell, bit it is not fresh.  The reception I met, Miku, she is the best of the best. Her attitude and her hospitality made me give the 5 stars rating to the hotel despite the comment I gave about the room.  The another thing I really like is the staff and the quality of your Michelin Chinese restaurant. Everything is‚Ä¶",5,,
Top notch,bee438,This feels like a top notch hotel. Dealing with the front desk and the concierge was super easy. The concierge understood what we asked for and got us what we were looking for.  We got an upgrade on the room and got a room that seemed to have been very recently refurbished. Nicely decorated and comfortable. The only drawback was a quite poor hairdryer and the make-up mirror seemed to have been left over since before the refurbishment.  We did not have breakfast at the hotel.  The gym seemed to be brand new but the changing rooms in particular the gents seemed a bit old.  This was my first experience with a Four Seasons hotel and I will be sure to be looking out for a Four Seasons hotel on future trips.,5,,
5 star service and staff,Wochner,We only spend one night but the service and the very nice staff we meet were of the highest quality and made us want to come back next time we are in singapore.  The room was new and stylish.  We also had a great meal in the restaurant and I was very happy with the selection and quality of the wine by the glass.,5,,
Excellent Guest Services,Fidela Valentina,"This is my birthday trip & my first time visiting Singapore and I must say that I didn't choose wrong to choose Four Seasons for my stay! Four Seasons really treat me very well, surprise me with a cake on my birthday & I can blow a candle this year! (tbh I'm kinda worried because of, it quite sad that I can't blow a candle this year). And also Miku really assisting me & my partner really well from the first day of our stay until arranging the birthday cake! It means a lot to me! :) And also they have a Chat App for guests to get connected with the Guest Services, so you can order in-room dining, ask, or request anything very easily through their chat app! it is very convenient! Thank you Four Seasons Singapore! :)",5,,
Wonderful Stay,redotrip,"We had the pleasure to stay here for 3 nights..A Beautiful Hotel...Great Food and Service, Beautiful Appointed Rooms, Lovely Pool and Spa Area.

Look forward to visiting again.",5,,
Fantastic start to our honeymoon,Elmo1989_03,"We stayed here for 2 nights for our honeymoon before flying onto Thailand. The Four Seasons is 30 mins from the airport and upon arrival we were warmly greeted and upgraded to a larger suite for free. When we got there we were welcomed with a card, chocolate strawberries, rose petals in the bath and a hand written Happy Honeymoon note on the window! The hotel itself is so beautiful and our suite was stunning. The bed oh my word.... it was like sleeping on a bed of marshmallow angels covered in caramel and we seriously are considering purchasing the pillows.   We did not opt for breakfast as it was something like 45 USD pp! We did however take advantage of the free nibbles in the bar area from 5:30-6:30pm with an amazing cocktail. We ate at the Michelin star Jiang-Nan Chun‚Ä¶",5,,
Nicely appointed five star rooms,Bad G,"The four seasons know what's important. Luxery Bedding, Good Food c/w a full range of amenities. The hotel might be considered a little out of the way to some. There is a large luxury mall 5 to 10 minutes walk from the mall. Taxis are reasonable in Singapore and you rarely wait more than a minute.",5,,
Exquisite hospitality!,Frini,"We visited Singapore to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs and husband‚Äôs double birthday. As we always prefer to stay at Four Seasons, we booked here. Their concept of hospitality is miles ahead every other brand. We were given an amazing room at the 18th floor and when we arrived everything was ready without even requesting for an early check in- the hotel was full due to Chinese New Year (early check in at 12:30pm). A great surprise was there for the birthday people as well (check fotos attached). The view was amazing, the bathroom was amazing, the ambience was fresh and clean.  Breakfast was complete and I still cannot forget those divine cranberry muffins. We also had dinner at One Ninety once. The food was good but what I have to say is that we ordered plain kids spaghetti with‚Ä¶",5,,

Excellent service even when very busy,dureid,"Our stay here would have gone extremely well had it not been for the receptionist who tried to give us any room and not to our request when we first checked in. He tried to convince us that he had no available rooms at high floors as we requested but after an hour of discussions "" he found one"" and it was excellent.",4,,
Flawless,DrDaveMaui,"From the greeter who met us at the airport and the driver who drove us from there--seamless entry on our first trip to Singapore. Everyone at breakfasts and dinner at One Ninety so friendly. Excellent food at all meals. Breakfast buffet rates at the top of our international 5 star hotel list. We loved our suite #1007. Spacious. Great view. Love the bathroom. Bed and bedding SOOOO comfortable. We were there for a birthday (it was acknowledged with a cake to the suite, and cake at breakfasts and dinner). Chines New Year Lion Dance well done and a lot of fun. VIP service. Concierges were great; helpful with every request. Front desk friendly at checkin and departure. We will return!",5,,

"Usual Four Seasons, beautiful.",koolrunnins,"Staying at a few different Four seasons I guess I've come to realize they're just so consistently great, this one was no different. From check in to breakfast to housekeeping, just well done. Loved the rooftop pool as well the pool on the 3rd floor. Great location on Orchard Blvd in a really beautiful area of Singapore. i split my visit to Singapore between the Four Seasons and the Marina Bay Sands. Lets just say I preferred the Four Seasons.",5,,
Everything taken care of,Melb2day,"From the toys given to my children at check in, to the nappies (correct size) baby products and plentiful complimentary bottled water, no detail was too small for this hotel.  The kids loved the pool (floaties provided), the staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. Fruit on the club level was fantastic. Complimentary biscuits and sweets for the kids each day.  Location was terrific. Rooms were spacious. Can‚Äôt rate highly enough!",5,,
Amazing Staff,Ann and Tony,"This was a really great experience. The staff looked after us from the moment we arrived, very early in the morning from a long flight. They provided us with tea and we were able to swim while we waited for a room. The room itself was lovely and the breakfast in the hotel provided almost everything you could want. The best thing about this hotel however was the staff who really went out of their way to be helpful.  We are really looking forward to our next visit.",5,,
Excellent Hotel Experience ,NYCTraveller323,"My family and I spent 4 nights at the Four Seasons at the end of a trip to SE Asia and I cannot say enough good things about this property. The staff were extremely helpful and accommodating and really went above and beyond - the cleaning staff did an especially standout job and went so far as to leave personalized notes for each person in my group - I was left a bookmark for a book I‚Äôd left open and a friend‚Äôs sunglasses were cleaned for her! Rooms are spacious, comfortable and functional, food is delicious and room service was nice enough to serve us breakfast in the evening upon request! Will absolutely return to this property on my next trip to Singapore!",5,,
Fantastic hotel and service,MR.P,"Great, great, great hotel.  Fantastic and consistent quality of facilities and service throughout the hotel and great location.  Room was spot on and the service was impeccable from the doorman through to the attendant at the rooftop pool.  A high quality, classy and understated hotel - so if you are looking for a refined and infused experience this is the place to stay.  We have stayed 4 nights and wish we were here longer.  The spa, gym and club house facilities are to the expected high standards as are the rooms and restaurants.  Thank you Four Seasons!",5,,
Still the best hotel in Singapore,s666davis,Stayed with my wife and family in October this year. I had stayed at this hotel several times during business trips and decided to have a seven day holiday in Singapore with family. We were not disappointed in the hotel as everything was first class from check in to check out. The staff are fabulous and nothing is a problem. The rooms are first class and the location of the hotel in relation to Orchard Road is great. We will return in 2020 Mr Stewart Davis Glasgow Scotland,5,,
Consistently Excellent,YRE,"The Four Seasons has been one of our two go-to hotels in Singapore for over six years and we are in the city multiple times each year, most recently this November.   The location is perfect for our needs, near Orchard Road but removed enough to be a quiet oasis.  The hotel is small and peaceful.   Our favorite features are 1) a very strong gym and two pools - one adults only (thank you!) located at the gym and one for all ages on the roof; 2) excellent Food and Beverage.   Evening room service is above and beyond, the restaurant breakfast is excellent.  It‚Äôs a buffet but of a much higher quality than any other hotel in Singapore and more peaceful; 3) the hotel looks much better after a recent renovation.   The rooms finally have decent TV‚Äôs and a much needed refresh.   If we had‚Ä¶",5,,
A great place,Donald T,"We have been travelling from the US to Bangkok to Singapore. We chose this property based on pricing, ratings and location.  I can say that we are not disappointed.  We booked two adjoining rooms which worked well for us. We stayed for several days, using this as a take off point. Given our location we did not have to contend with any blockages or barriers as we prepared for New Year  celbrations as some properties did closer to the waterfront.   Since our flight is leaving around midnight local time on our last day we consolidated to one room so we could clean up after wandering for the day and before boarding the flight.   The staff from the front desk though the cleaning crew have been friendly and helpful.  The facility is clean and efficent.  I would stay here again.",5,,

Eddric Yang, our banquet manager is a gift to your hotel. His sincerity for those under his care is truly astounding. Who knew that after our wedding we would leave the hotel having forged a new friendship.

Overall great/luxury hotel in great location,Aus-traveller,"This is a great hotel pretty much on Orchard road (down a side street). Hotel was beautifully presented for Christmas and the guest rooms were very clean. Guest bathroom also had a luxury feeling to, which some 5 star hotels can lack. Bed was big a comfortable. Good electronics (digital aircon switch, electric blinds etc), arrival cookies. Maybe air conditioning was a bit cold on arrival, but you can alter that once you are in. Overall would stay again. Have stayed in many 5 star hotels over the years and this was definitely worth the spend. Much better than the Hilton around the corner - which I stayed in earlier during the week & is a bit dated considering the money you pay for it. ",5,,
Charming Singapore,misharer1,Reception staff are amazing and very professional. The lighting in the room is very dim specially on the evening.

Superb hotel,Candi,Beautiful hotel and the one bedroom suite was extremely comfortable with quality linen and touches. The choice of restaurants is excellent and provides super variety. The only negative feedback is that room service gave me half a glass of wine (literally) which I had not noticed at the time as I was signing the bill. The pool is locked in the evenings which I found unusual and disappointing if you want a late night swim.,5,,
Best service for a luxury hotel / Elegant updated rooms,djmontano,"In a city with hotels constantly updating and renovating, it'll be hard to top this hotel's service. I became sick with the flu and a bad cold during the third night of my stay. It must have been just before 6Am when I called the concierge for help. They immediately called the gift shop so they could get pain meds and coordinated with room service to send up a hot breakfast with a pot of ginger tea with honey and lemon on the side (just how I like it). When I felt I needed to see a doctor, they made an appointment right away with a nearby clinic.

Like the Shangri'La its a little bit out of it for busines travellers.   Other drawbacks are its well maintained but feeling a little dated vesus the competition.  Also at time of writing (November 19) it has a pretty major construction site next door that looks like it will be active for at least a year. I got a room facing away and didnt notice any noise, but it'd be worth avoiding if you can I think.  The food in the restaurants is very good even if they are a little lacking in atmosphere.",4,,

Amazing stay with 5 star service in a great location,kitty32655,"I don't know where to start because everything about our experience at the Four Seasons was first class. They give each guest specialized attention and remember your name and any special preferences you might have.  The hotel itself is classy, quiet and in a great location (about a 5 minute walk to Orchard Road).  The staff were definitely a highlight. They were professional and friendly. My niece and I have dietary restrictions and Thamil from the restaurant went out of his way to have special meals prepared for us in the morning. He always had a smile on his face and something nice to say. The front desk staff, concierge, spa staff and doormen were just as friendly and always asked about our day when we returned from our outings to the hotel.   The room was spacious and very‚Ä¶",5,,

"Great hotel, great service.",GARY L,"We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay for four nights. Four Seasons provides class and service.  Rooms were large and comfortable, restaurant was excellent (although this, like other good food in Singapore, tends to be pricey) but best thing was the staff.  Either Singaporeans in general are all warm and serving with a smile, or they‚Äôve done an excellent job training them. To a person, from great concierge service to attentive waiters to always-smiling house staff, helped make for most pleasant stay ",5,,
"Great experience, Personable Service, Warm & Pleasant Staff",masood1976,"Stayed for four nights in the hotel. The staff is great, extremely pleasant and takes care of all the comforts and needs.

Great hotel to stay in Singapore,Paula C,"I spent one night at Four Seasons in Singapore and I would recommend it to anyone who visit Singapore.  The hotel is very well located. You have main spots walking distance and also bus and tube very close.  The room is big with all details also in the bathroom. Also the breakfast is really good. You have different kind of products and meals to choose from and the environment is really nice. I had an issue with my flight, it was delayed for 6 hours and the person in concierge help me to change the flight talking directly to the airline and managed to get another flight and connection so I could arrive home on time. I would like to say spacial thanks to Rachell Yne who was on the phone and got to change the reservation of my flight.",5,,
Great classic hotel in a quiet spot of Orchard,Micjiao,"Four Seasons brand exudes luxury and this one is no different. Classic decor public areas with spacious, functional and very well designed modern rooms. Bose soundlink iii was provided if you need to crank up your music. Staffs were excellent as well. Located at quiet spot behind Orchard, you'll need a little walk to reach the shopping belt. Only couple of minutes to get to Wheelock then you can enjoy the underground access to ION or TANG areas. The hotel also has an indoor access to Hilton that serves as an alternate route to get to main Orchard road. Will definitely return but I would skip the breakfast buffet unless it's for convenience.",5,,

GM of the Year,Malaysia Boleh,"I regularly stay in 5 star hotels for business however this time it was special. I‚Äôve met plenty of GMs in my time but the Four Seasons apparently has a new GM, genuinely engaging, has a serious interest in how he and his team can improve your experience in the hotel but also in singapore. From my short stay I can also see this wasn‚Äôt a one-off I saw him regularly with guests and coaching his team to ensure his guests got the best out of their stay. My breakfast experience was simply a delight, top quality, a range of breakfast items that just seems endless and also creative. Great work Simon and team, I will be back!!!!",5,,
Excellent stay,Chicco2018A,"We loved our stay at this hotel. The room was beautiful, the service impeccable. The Four Seasons really makes a difference in service, is right above the rest! The hotel is very well maintained.  The only minus was the breakfast, that we found was below that of other 5 start hotels in Singapore like the Mandarin Oriental for example. It does detract from the ambience that the restaurant has no natural light.  Still, I would happily be back!",5,,
Every bit as good as I expected,Ananya B,"I was going back to Singapore after almost 6 years, and naturally chose Four Seasons since my family had enjoyed staying there in 2014 as well. I am happy to report that it was every bit as good as I remembered, and even better in some ways!  Thanks to Jenny for noticing that we were using a mouse without the mouse pad, and thoughtfully giving us one even when he had not asked! Concierge services were impeccable, and staff were friendly and helpful about giving directions and advise about the best way to get to our destination. Breakfast seemed better than I remembered, and staff were good about remembering what my kids had liked the previous day and giving the same item even before we had asked. Rooms were great - clean, luxurious, comfortable, as one would expect.  I do have a‚Ä¶",5,,

We finally get the stroller back and it was a great experience for us. thank you so much Four Seasons.,5,,
No options for breakfast,FongLady,"Breakfast buffet is nice and generous but not all the time, the guests could come down to have it due to age, mobility, health or lack of time. In my case, I had wasn't feeling well, called the frontdesk if I could just have a breakfast plate in my room. But they said that only the buffet is available. I stay in hotels often and most of them offer in-room breakfast if the guest is not able to go to the buffet. Otherwise, this hotel is clean and has good location.",3,,

An exceptional stay,ranabirsa,"Impeccable service, very spacious room even at base category. The view was amazing, could see part of the Marina Bay Sands. There was however no welcome drink provided but I must thank the team for an early check-in. Very thoughtful especially the fact that everyone knew our name right at the kerb. Room cleaning and Make the bed service was outstanding. Would‚Äôve loved few complimentary cookies/fruits everyday in room. Breakfast was a tad boring especially due to repetitive food items everyday, but the thoughtful service really covered any lacuna. The doormen were super helpful especially delivering our food orders and with our shopping bags.  Would‚Äôve loved a remote device to control the curtains and lights. Also, the TV remote was not functioning, though we hardly used it.  A‚Ä¶",5,,

Lovely hotel in the central shopping area,Rachel R,"The hotel is about 2 blocks off the main shopping hub of Orchard, where you will also find plenty of restaurants and the MRT.

The staff is very helpful at calling taxis, storing luggage, etc  The breakfast, which was includes in my rate, was an enourmous spread of food with selections from all over the world - eggs made to order, curries, fresh fruits, dumplings, etc.   Some very minor nits: the room is pretty dark, even with all the lights on and they aren‚Äôt all on one switch so you have to do a sweep of turning off all the lights‚Ä¶",4,,

I don't think I will ever go back to the MBS area from now. I liked the slightly remote location and the fact that it was still a walking distance to malls and metro (they are all connected from Wheelock Center).

Oasis in the city ,WhereItsWarm,"My family and I spent 5 nights at the FS Singapore. The hotel is a veritable oasis in the city. A 5 minute walk to the city‚Äôs most upscale shopping, and less than a 10 minute walk to the nearest MTR, the hotel is conveniently located. It has 2 pools (one in the roof) for cooling down, and a Michelin star Chinese restaurant on premises. We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant and it was lovely.  The breakfast buffet is among the most varied I have seen with everything from fresh fruit to Asian to North American fare. Champagne mimosas were also available.   A small mishap when we arrived was quickly corrected and I appreciated the assistance of Christopher Tsoi, the Guest Experience Manager, who took extra good care of us.   Overall, we had a lovely stay and I would most‚Ä¶",5,,
A truly great Singapore Hotel,kiidbj4a22,"Removed from teh hustle and bustle of Central Singapore, an oasis of care and attention.  Great atmosphere, attentive staff and very comfortable rooms.  The swimming pool was of high quality and very well cared for.",4,,
Very poor for a Four Seasons,OhOhBug,"Four Seasons has a special place in our heart because we were engaged at the Koh Samui resort and ever since then have made every effort to ""knock off"" Four Seasons in the countries we visit. Normally in any other hotel, it will not matter but due to the recognition and prestige you would expect from a Four Seasons, our experience was terrible.   Before we go into the bad, I would like to recognize the amazing staff. All the FS that we have been to have had amazing staff that provides excellent customer service, synonymous with the FS brand. They catered to an issue we had right away and we were thoroughly pleased. The bedding was also typical FS excellence where we can just melt away at night after a long night around town.   Now to the unfortunate parts.    1) The third floor‚Ä¶",1,,
Excellent & unparrallelled experience,Rlullaby,"I threw my 27th birthday party at Four Seasons. Brought my dog and about 50 friends. Felt taken care of by the hotel in every aspect. My preferences, guests, my dog were all taken into consideration. Got upgraded from one room suite to ambassador‚Äôs suite due to a last minute lack of rooms. I was very pleased to find out. Before the big day, I visited Four Seasons to look at the rooms. They patiently and graciously took us around the special rooms that were available that night. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask to take a look. It will make you want to book it! The nicest touch is the little embroided towel for my dog, dog bed and bowl they provided during my stay. ",5,,
Not fantastic ,Zac C,Corporate rate of S$300/night without tax didn't include breakfast. Not many local breakfast places in the vicinity.  Hotel is old but well kept. Room is clean and huge but water heater is slow reacting. Bed is abit too soft for my taste. Room service is prompt. Food is average. Staff is generally polite but the check out service is rather slow.  Gym is decent sized. Wifi can get choppy at peak hours. ,3,,
2 night staycation - exceptional service,LucyHSG,"I just returned from a 2 night staycation at this hotel. I have travelled a fair bit and had a few staycations in Singapore where we live, so I‚Äôm not that easily delighted especially with a toddler in tow.   The Four Seasons is so far my favourite hotel in Singapore. From checkin, where the staff and bellboys took the time to chat, remember your names, give a toy to the child and see you to the lift..... to the room, which was far more spacious than most doubles around town, and filled with little extras ready for a toddler - kiddy toothpaste, toothbrush, bath wash and step stool all setup in the enormous bathroom which made my little girl squeal with excitement... to the comfy bed and sofa (though the pillows need work), great view and every amenity needed, its a lovely hotel.‚Ä¶",5,,
Fantastic,Mike,A completely fantastic hotel! The service is spotless from the second you approach the entrance until they conveniently slide you a water bottle as they load your luggage in the taxi when you leave. We had an awesome room with excellent interior and top details. The room service is great including a very long menu of high quality food. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I‚Äôve ever slept in.  It‚Äôs definitely not cheap but well worth every penny.,5,,
Well-rounded Orchard Road experience,SFO_intl,"In my 10+ trips to Singapore I've never stayed on Orchard Road, preferring the marina/Clarke Quay and Suntec area. I opted on this trip, due to my client's location on the west side of the city, to try the FS and Orchard Road. I'm glad I did!  While Orchard Road still might not be my location preference, I was quite smitten by the FS. Rooms are just outstanding; spacious, lots of light, big airy bathrooms, and very quiet. And of course there is the outstanding FS bed which is in a class all on its own.   The pool, fitness and spa facilities are decent here, although perhaps a bit dated compared to other hotels (and certainly when compared to other FS properties). The fitness area in particular is a bit congested with machines packed in closely together. I didn't experience any‚Ä¶",5,,
One bedroom suite honest review,Mario M,"Arrival - came at 11 am and the room was not ready which is understandable. Going for a walk and lunch and received an email confirming to room is ready at 1 pm. 2 hours early.  Check in - was a breeze. staff very attentive and did all the paperwork within 10 minutes.  Room - massive and spacious. It was on level 17. The view was not the best due construction site, not hotel's fault. All around Singapore, construction everywhere, which means the country is moving forward all the time.  Bathroom - very spacious and yet functional. Some hotel's bathroom can be really huge and luxury, but not functional. Bath tub on the smaller side, but good size for the toddler.  I really like the new renovated room, very simple and functional. The one bedroom suite is a good option, if you have‚Ä¶",5,,
Didn‚Äôt want to leave ,Midlife traveller,"Stayed 7 nights with my husband. Upgraded ok check in for a reasonable fee that included breakfast. Room was incredible - most comfortable bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. Huge bed, huge bathroom. Noise insulation fantastic - never heard a sound. Every member of staff is absolutely the best at what they do. Location near subway is good - although Orchard wasn‚Äôt my favourite part of Singapore. Do make sure you use the pool on level 3 - adults only and so beautiful and peaceful.   One thing to bear in mind - we travelled in early July maybe this was why - quite a lot of young children at the hotel, if you‚Äôre looking for a more adult hotel I would perhaps consider this as a fact. I have children but sometimes you want a break from family life! ",5,,
One of the best hotels I‚Äôve ever stayed in,Royce Lucas,"This hotel is, without a doubt, the nicest hotel in Singapore. The rooms were exceptional, with lavish bedding and incredible amenities, as well as having an amazing breakfast. The breakfast has vegetarian and vegan options for those who need it, and is open from 6:30, which works well for people who need to fly out early (like we did). I would like to personally mention Justine and Shou Wei for their above-and-beyond service at breakfast. Absolutely wonderful people if you get the chance to see them.   My only comment for improvement would be the pricing. The breakfast is incredible, but Is still quite expensive for larger groups of people (think $300 for 6 people). Nevertheless, if you can afford it, I‚Äôd go to it at least once.   I will always return here for my future trips‚Ä¶",5,,
Excellent customer services,Y S,"The Four seasons in Singapore is an a absolutely gorgeous hotel with exceptional customer services from their staff. We were especially impressed with the concierge desk who was most helpful in recommendations especially restaurants.   The only con was the location which is a bit out of the way from the harbor where most of the attractions were. However, it was easy to get around by cab. ",5,,
A truely wonderful stay,Vendor_E,"Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making our first stay in Singapore truely memorable.

Four Seasons Singapore,Dan and Josie,"We stayed in a king room which was supposedly an upgrade, however seemed like a standard king room. The finishes were excellent, with thought and detail going into each element of the room. I did notice, however, that the building has air conditioning issues which is leading to musty smells in the rooms and a wet feeling due to humidity. The vents in the hallways were dripping with condensation causing some damage on the floors. Otherwise, I would say this is an excellent hotel, although not much to distinguish it as a Four Seasons. The breakfast buffet was amazing, and the food and service at the restaurant was wonderful.",4,,
Great facilities and service,Traveling Mom,"My family stayed in two rooms, one Deluxe and one Premier. Premier room had more room and allowed for an extra rollaway bed with ample space.

Easily grabbed Grab taxis and with walking distance to many malls and restaurants. Would easily return for another stay.",5,,
Fantastic Hotel,KPL,"The hotel is central,modern with newly renovated rooms.

Below expectations. ,Sam G,"We visited Singapore for 2 weeks for business/pleasure and stayed in 4 different 5* hotels. Out of all, Four Seasons was the weakest hotel and left us really disappointed.   We had high expectations as one would expect from this kind of hotel.  Maybe we visited at bad time and got the worst room, but the hotel lacks of ambience, the service was ok-ish, the room shows signs of wear and tear and the room is not as squeaky clean as expected.  Service at the front desk is ok, not as friendly or engaging as at the other hotels. Really felt it, coming from elsewhere.  The family pool is freezing and empty. It just isn‚Äôt fun for kids or parents, lacks of ambience, kids get bored (or cold!) quickly.  Alison was lovely though, thank you for looking after us.   Club on the 3rd floor is‚Ä¶",2,,
Amazing hotel!,jenwolfe28,We stopped in Singapore for two nights en route to Bali from the U.S. This hotel was a gem! We loved the rooms overlooking the city and the buffet breakfast was incredible. We loved our stay and recommend the hotel for couples and families.,5,,
This comfortable hotel ticks all the boxes,hilzPS,"It's not cheap to stay here, but it is worth every cent.  My room is large, quiet, has everything I need.  The staff here could not be more helpful or obliging.  The location is good for keen Orchard Rd shoppers.  Slightly confusing to walk back here due to extensive building works!  Food excellent, room service terrific.  Two decent pools with helpful attendants.  Note  the one on the 3rd floor gets no sun due to tall buildings all around it.  the one on the 20th floor however does get sun. I  am thankful for the air conditioning as Singapore is v hot and terribly humid.  I would stay here again in a  heartbeat!  This is not a hotel for those seeking trendiness or modernity but if you like quiet comfort then this is for you",5,,
Wonderful Stay. Highly Recommend!,amval2019,The Four Seasons Singapore is a hotel that exceeded my expectations. An outstanding staff that made our stay special. Our Premier room had 2 Queen beds for our family of 4 and we found the size of the room was very spacious. It was clean and the bathroom was luxurious. We wished we could have extended our stay!

Refurbished rooms but everything else is tired,amit,Stayed here after a number of years in June.    The good bits  - fantastic location   - recently refurbished rooms with very high standards ala four seasons style.    - room service very good  - the bar is well stocked and upto 9 pm they service complimentary food - cheese nuts bread etc  The not so good  - breakfast has limited choices and quality of food is wanting.  Breakfast is in a windowless room with below average service  - There is no other eating option in the hotel  - the lounge is old and tired.   - the pool is small and very poorly maintained.  service is non existent.   - rooms over look a construction site,3,,
Doesn't live up to the Four Seasons name,Rosanne A,"We have stayed at several Four Seasons across the world and are very familiar with Singapore hotels, decided to try out Four Seasons Singapore. Immediately upon walking in the lobby is dark and compartmentalized, dated. We went to our room next which is slightly more modern like 2010 ish. Pillows and bed are only parts of the property that resemble what you would expect at a luxury property and Four Seasons name. The top floor pool is decent. Nothing spectacular. 3rd floor is where the property goes down to an old Holiday Inn feel. Grout in pool is dirty, old style title like a public lap pool, jacuzzi is dirty with a railing that has paint chipping off and mildew mold growing on the stairs.

Solid choice for Singapore ,jaizee,Great choice in Singapore- it is what I would have expected from the Four Seasons. The service and the location on Orchard Road are very good. The rooms were well-sized and clean. I enjoyed the breakfast - they offered a large selection of Asian and Western style dishes. Definitely would stay here again. ,5,,
"Great location, surprisingly large room",amandajiamin,"I really appreciated how the location is still central enough to be walking distance from Orchard Road, but far enough that the noise levels aren't a factor (as compared to some of the hotels on Orchard Rd or Scotts Rd)  Room was large (especially by Singapore standards), hotel staff were all friendly and eager to help. Two thumbs up!  Only slight inconsistency is that I got fresh fruits throughout my first stay, but none on my second stay half a week later :(",5,,
Wonderful home-base in Singapore,Vacationer572478,"Our family had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Singapore.

Still my favorite in Singapore.  Service is hard to beat,Ab Initio,"I have stayed here many times over the years.  I like the location near Orchard road and appreciate the personal service the hotel gives.   With all the new hotels being built closer to downtown, I thought that this hotel would have suffered a bit in business, but clearly people still come, attracted by the four seasons brand.  We upgraded to a small suite as we were staying for a whole week, and did not regret it.  Another fabulous four seasons experience. One more thing:  concierge service seemed to not be en par with a typical four seasons. When my wife asked for a place to get a pedicure, they first pointed her to the Four Seasons spa (which doesn't do pedicures), and then told her they ""don't know any place to recommend"")  Sees a bit lame",5,,
Best service in SG,TravelingMama,"Have stayed here multiple times each year over the last few years and theyre always the most helpful, personal and genuine staff.

It was a great size and also had a large bathroom with bath and shower and separate toilet.   The room itself was lovely. Everything was quite new and modern, including the huge flat screen television. The beds in this hotel are up there with the best I have ever slept in.

Fantastic Property,hahabye,"My family of four recently spent 3 nights at this property.  It is wonderful, with very good service and luxurious rooms.  The shower was the best hotel shower we have ever had, the beds were luxurious, everything was up to the five star standard that four Seasons has set for itself.    we loved that they allowed us full use of the facilities after we checked out, as this allowed us to explore Singapore on our last day while they held our bags and enabled us to shower before our 18 hour flight home.",5,,
Best hotel in great location ,Tracy R,"As always the Four Seasons does not disappoint! The property is located in the quieter part of Singapore on Orchard Blvd. Walking distance to the Singapore Botanical gardens and plenty of excellent shopping and food.

Nor do I need to remind anyone of the fine art and chic/elegent furnishings.  What blew me away this time is that when I came back to my room after a day of exercise (as seen in the photos I posted) not only was the room spotless (to be expected) but that the cleaning ladies had neatly tied up all my phone and computer cords and I found a new book marker in my book with a handwritten note from the cleaning lady, ""Dear Mr. Cantwell, Here's a book mark to help you keep track of your reading.

Top notch,Kasimir2013,"We stayed at the Four Seasons on a business trip for 5 days and it was first class all around.  Breakfast was a great buffet with some changes each day. On the second day they already knew what each of us preferred for coffee or tea.  Fitness is very good too, as is the blue hour at the bar.  We found dinner to be extremely good too. Again they knew our wishes and needs. Rooms were spacious, the beds first class...  there was nothing to complain and I mean nothing.  Even the Spa is very good for a business hotel.

Sadly not up to the usual Four Seasons standard,BunburyTim61,"Stayed for 4 nights at this hotel. Usually I would give Four Seasons properties a 5 star rating but unfortunately it slipped a bit for me this time round. My biggest gripe was the fact that when I used the gym and pool twice during my stay I was confronted by a terrible stench from the male changeroom. To describe it would be the stench of urine. I mentioned it on the first day to the staff manning the gym but to my dismay it was still there the next day. You must realise that all over Singapore, there is this thing about cleanliness. It would be one of the cleanest cities in the world. You just have to go to Changi Airport to know what I am talking about. So to be confronted with this problem at one of the World's best hotel chain was a bit disappointing. Apart from that little‚Ä¶",4,,
By far the BEST!! Wedding,cassandra elish... c,"GWP and Shangri-la cannot come close to the service we received at Four Seasons Hotel. We were blessed to have Eddric and Affandi to manage our wedding! I am no bridezilla but I had a typical big fat Greek wedding kind of wedding to plan. They both had the patience of saints when dealing with us and our families. Both were so sincere in their advice and help.   One (out of many) moments that truly touched my heart was when Affandi  came to offer me bedroom slippers right after the dancing. My feet were sore, but even before I could say anything he was there with he bedroom slippers and a bag to hold my shoes. If ever one decides to have their wedding...I wouldn't think twice if it is with Four Seasons",5,,

During that time I have also stayed at other good hotels in Singapore (of which there are plenty) but no other hotel compares for the quality of service and the truly excellent staff.  There have been design changes in the bedrooms in the last year or so. Writing desks have been replaced by a side table and comfortable chair; chests of drawers have been replaced. However, when I requested a writing desk (I was in Singapore on business and needed a big surface for documents and my laptop) it was brought to the room the same day.

Both are convenient although the walk along Orchard Boulevard is somewhat easier because it is straight down to ION Orchard Shopping Centre. The other walk from Four Seasons to Orchard Road through Hilton Hotel (a connected passageway) is a bit annoying because it winds a lot, up or down several stairs, around corners, so I prefer the first walk. Either way brings you to Orchard Road in just minutes: all in all a fantastic location.  The room We had Room 1920‚Ä¶",5,,
Four Seasons as Always,Nikos N,"I have never felt dissapointed of Four Seasons. The same stands for Four Seasons Singapore. The experience is excellent. Even the guests are gentle and discreet. The hotel us over 20years old, but you don't see it anywhere. The staff is welcoming and efficient. Even using the guest's name comes up naturally. The location is the best; very near to Orchard Road and you can walk to the most imporatnt spots. In short: Fully Recommended.",5,,
New favourite ,Alek,"It‚Äôs really hard to fault this property. It has everything you could want and more; wonderful service, beautiful rooms, best in class f&b, and a convenient location. I really enjoyed its classic South East Asian aesthetic which felt authentically Singaporean, compared to many of the competing luxury hotels which lack local character and feel like they could belong in any city. However, the true highlight is the staff. Everyone I interacted with seemed to genuinely care about me with a level of sincerity that I‚Äôve never before experienced in Singapore, and it often felt like I was talking with old friends. If I were being picky I‚Äôd say the gym seemed like an afterthought, old equipment in a cramped space, but it was hardly in use during my time so it felt more like a private‚Ä¶",5,,
Brief business trip toSinapore,Journey08033002751,The Four Seasons staff were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel was very modern and clean and the breakfast buffet was very. very good (and that's something coming from someone who typically hates buffet eating).  ,5,,
Great Hotel,Bulungo M,Enjoyed my stay at the Four Seasons. Location was convienant. Short walking distsnce from Orchard Rd (and Ion Mall) but nestled away in quiet boulevard. Newly refurbished rooms with comfortable bedding. Really friendly and attentive staff made my stay wonderful. ,4,,
Best hotel we have ever stayed in! Did not want to leave,Tabitha D,"After being in VIETNAM for 2 weeks  prior we were very excited for a couple  of nights  of luxury to end our holiday. This place did not disappoint!! Staff were amazing, helpful and friendly from the doorman all throughout.  Our room was absolutely huge and stunning.  Gorgeous bathroom with so many mirrors, bed was the comfiest we have ever slept in. Breakfast buffet was to die for. Would recommend to anyone and everyone,  2 nights was not enough! ",5,,
"Class, peace and elegance",ikol_22,"I would like to underline the extreme courtesy of the receptionists and the concierge. As expected, everything at Four Seasons is perfect. I loved the fruit in the room (and the orchid). The only ""minus"" is the fan of the air conditioned a bit noisy but it's really a minus.",5,,
One of the best hotel ever in Singapore.,ChrisHamilton,"Low-key but attentive. It has a very welcoming attitudes with its quality. Location is perfect, close to Orchard road and other main areas. Easy to access subway. More than this, the restaurant is also a highlight. ",5,,
Good hotel,KANG LAM,Very good location which is next to Ion Orchard. The hotel looks old be the room is very well renovated and nice. Best is the swimming pool with Jacuzzi. You will get a peach tea & towel when just sit down the sun-chair which is amazing. Quick check in & check out. Housekeeping really cares to the detail. I just requested for ice bucket for the first day and I got it everyday without request. What an amazing service. Highly recommend Four-season Singapore ,5,,
Still top of the game,Melb-Doc,"I stayed for 5 nights on a business. Everything about the hotel was top quality. Stand out quality was the service. Whether it was the outstanding dedicated staff (thank you Chloe) looking after us all day, everyday at the Grange room, to the room service, helping me with my special meal 5*****.  Facilities are top notch, rooms are large, clean, modern. Restaurants are amazing, especially the ground floor restaurant buffet.  There a 20m outdoor lap pool, which I had to myself for an hour in the morning!  Concierge will help with anything and location is perfect. Good to know is that there is a walkway from 4 Seasons through a quiet mall and through Hilton, to Orchard Rd. There‚Äôs a nice Irish Pub up the street, if you feel like casual food and a short stroll. Great stay.",5,,
My first out of the country trip with my family in Singapore,cfjude,"One of the best luxury hotel I have been. Staffs were so friendly and accommodating during our stay. Very posh. Nothing negative to say but Excellent! I look forward to come back and spent few days on my next holiday. And by the way, The room we were had a very nice view! Everything was excellent..",5,,
My home away from home,Dean5star,As per usual my experience at Four Seasons Singapore was outstanding which is why I keep coming back. They say it's all about the position but that's only half of it. The hotel itself is beautiful and the the staff are brilliant and nothing is ever too much for them. This truly is my home away from home.,5,,
Nicely renovated property with high standard of service,Maarten B,"Recently stayed at this property for four nights with my wife and daughter. Really enjoyed the renovated suite and services overall. Friendly and caring staff especially in restaurants. Food in one-ninety is well prepared, not complicated and good value for money IMO. Pool area on the 20th floor can use some improvement, small shallow pool, limited seats and drinks come from bar in ground floor which is not entirely efficient. Hotel should consider to open ground floor pool for families. Surrounding area is a bit rough at night not suitable for families after dark. Minor complain I thought I was awarded a complementary late check out but discovered a half day's charge on my bill after I received it by email. Will stay again on our next visit,",4,,
The beds were really comfortable,Layla Remington,"The beds were really comfortable! Hard to get up in the mornings! Location of hotel was within walking distance to Orchard Road. Service and amenities were excellent. Like the gym,tennis courts and pool. A mini resort in the heart of downtown Singapore",4,,
Stunning Service,MaryJ2016,The flowers in the entry way are just gorgeous. The front desk people are so helpful. The room was beautiful with a fine view. The Michelin one star restaurant was truly good. I arrived very early in the morning and the staff could not have been more welcoming even at such an early hour. I also had to leave on a very early flight and once again everyone was just so helpful. I had a spa facial and a spa massage. Both were quite good. I celebrated my birthday and the staff was so celebratory. I loved when they asked me 'when will I return'!,5,,
We weren‚Äôt disappointed!,Chris B,"A great hotel with real attention to detail. We loved the city view suite which had curtains that automatically opened when entering the room, or via wall switches. The views are stunning, and the rooms fitted out to the highest standard.  The staff were all fantastic. Our only slight criticism was the Michelin Star restaurant, which we felt didn't live up to other Michelin restaurants we have visited.  A few people in the reviews complained that the hotel isn't directly on Orchard Road, however perhaps they didn't realise that there's a discreet door next to the lobby bar which walks you straight into the shopping centre, and will bring you out on Orchard Rd by The Hilton lobby.  We will almost certainly stay here again on our next visit, however we'll eat in other restaurants.",5,,
5-star at its best,LEWI_13,"Every detail in this hotel is 5-star ! Rooms, room service, and especially breakfast. The breakfast is an absolute highlight with the variety and quality of food. Everything prepared with passion. The hotel is in a good location, easy access to all the attractions of Singapore with the tube.  Low rates for taxis. So no problem to get everywhere. ",5,,
Four Seasons - Always Five Star,drmellos,"Beautiful Hotel. Large comfortable room with fantastic view, great location, morning breakfast is amazing and the service is impeccable.  Only spent two nights after arrival in Singapore, before flying off to Bali to catch a cruise. It was a great place to check out the shops on Orchard, relax by one of two pools, and car/driver picked us up at airport and delivered us again for departure.  Highly recommend.",5,,
"Lovely Hotel, Excellent Service, Great Location",Suellen T,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore on a stop over to the Maldives and enjoyed it so much that we booked to stay again on our return trip.   This hotel is in an excellent location, close to shopping, MRT subway and an easy walk to Botanic Gardens which is a must visit.   It's a beautiful hotel with lovely, comfortable rooms and luxurious bathrooms. There are numerous delightful areas (restaurants, bars, 2 swimming pools, guest lounges etc) to enjoy. We thoroughly enjoyed cocktails and nibbles in the bar each night.   The staff at this hotel are outstanding. They went over and above to stand out and offer a very personalised service. Each time we left the hotel or arrived back the doormen were ready with cold water. The Conceirge team were excellent, listening to‚Ä¶",5,,
Just Flawless from start to finish!,Toronto N_Bacon,"From before we arrived, an email was sent to us to greet us and asked for our special requests.  And only at Four Seasons, all our requests were honoured (never happen anywhere else other than Four Seasons Hong Kong).  The room is newly refurbished and comfortable.  Breakfast was amazing and very cozy, comfortable room. Location is great, only 3-4 minutes from the Ion Orchard and the metro and 20 minutes walk to the Botanical Garden.  But most amazing aspect of the hotel is the staff and the personal service that they provide.  I mean everyone and every moment. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental prior to Singapore Four Seasons, and the client service at the Four Seasons just excel in every way.  Mandarin was good, but Four Seasons was just BETTER.   The only minor criticism is‚Ä¶",5,,
Cool pool,29abduazizm,For my first 5 days in Singapore I stayed at The Four Seasons hotel. It has amazing food and two pools and one hot tub and 20 floors and it has overwhelming beds.

very good hotel,Kulchaya J,"Excellent service Room are comfortable , spacious, clean like toiletries, fragrant showers , places near shopping areas, Orchard Road and next time if there is a chance. Definitely stay like a lot. and we will recommend this Four Seasons hotel to my friends.",5,,
"Nice, but could be better.",arkom,"Newly refurbished rooms with super comfortable beds.  One thing that I found annoying is coming back to stuffy room after a hot day.    Maybe because of some sort of eco friendly a/c system but every time we came back to the room, the a/c was always set to a low setting the room was always stuffy.   One thing I found interesting was that is seemed like they copy and pasted the room design for the new Four Seasons Seoul as it almost looks identical.",4,,
"Convenient, but not special",ladodgerone,"My expectations for a Four Seasons are very high. This Four Seasons was fine but not great. Room was a little bit tired and it was noisy with the construction. Ion orchard mall nearby was convenient but it didn‚Äôt seem to be near any place else I needed to go for this trip. Gym was good but I had to use it when the spa had not opened yet, and you sort of had to walk through a tomb to get to the gym itself which was very creepy. Valet took forever in the morning to get a taxi.   Overall I would give this an average score and definitely on the lower end of Four Seasons standards. ",3,,
Pleasant stay,Roving62851745639,The location is just a 5minutes walk  from ION Orchard but quiet area with green around. The room was refurbished recently so all facilities in the room were new. Staff were attentive n feeling like I was a home.,4,,
nice but not comfort,Arwa a,"we stayed there for 2 nights  our room was in the 14 floor  , the house keeping only empty the trash and re do the bed , they didn't vacuum or map the furniture , we found spiders in the bed and other sports in the sweet, its really annoying especially when you are allergic.",3,,
Super comfortable rooms and impressive overall ,dsbali,"My first stay in a few years and since the rooms were refurbished.  I loved my room - the most comfortable and luxurious bed, spacious and lovely bathroom.  Everything has a luxe feel. The hotel lobby is beautiful with the most stunning flower display (smells amazing too).  Breakfast is great - great quality and selection. Service overall is very good although more effort could be made at checkin to explain amenities and hotel facilities.  Overall, one of my favourite hotels in Singapore and one of the best Four Seasons properties I‚Äôve stayed in.  ",5,,
Great experience and comfort,Passenger36594429495,"The hotel was overall an amazing place. Especially the outside bar which allowed us to ran away from all the air condition in the building. The food was amazing and the chef catered for our request, and a variety of choices. It is also wonderful for the staff to call you by your name and always greeting you and interacting with you. Another one is comfort of the room. Its spacious and the bed and pillow is so comfy. ",5,,
"Singapore Four Seasons has excellent facilities, rooms, and staff",Michael H,"The staff is excellent.  The restaurants have great food and excellent service.

Exactly what you would expect of Four Seasons,travelhappy111,"Arrived after a very long flight.  Receptionist was welcoming and check in was quick and smooth.  We were offered a good deal on breakfast which I deliberately hadn't included in our booking. Glad we took the deal as the breakfast was great.  Large selection of everything and option of freshly cooked dishes too.   Room was large, luxurious, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  Great view which was so good at night.  Housekeeping was excellent. Couldn't fault anything.  Every member of staff we came into contact with was friendly and helpful.  We ate in 190 on a couple of occasions and enjoyed the food especially the bread they bake in house.  It was superb. There are two swimming pools.

Excellent location ,Mike Lim,The hotel is situated around the corner from the famous Orchard Road.

Perfect,drjmax,Four Seasons Singapore is a delightful property. Check in was personalized andr suite was simply divine.  The breakfast buffet is world class and multi-cultural.

From the reception to the room cleaning everything was perfect. Room was spacious , moderrn and with all necessary amenities. We used the pool and the gym was Amazing. Just a walk away from Orchard road where the major shop are , we have really appreciated our stay.

Top Hotel in the center of Singapore.,Connector46217939536,"I think this hotel is even better than staying in the crowded Marina Bay Sands. It was a very good choice given that the rooms are very spacious, food was very good, and staff were personally involved to every guests' needs. The city view was also really nice and value for money was very obvious in each facility. The hotel was not crowded as compared with other hotels and if you're finding for a place to relax, contemplate and spend a valuable quality time, this is your hotel. ",5,,
Wonderful hotel,Sylvia Yan,"Good location, walking distance to ION or Takashimaya shopping center.  Rooms are very spacious. It is like newly renovated.

The interior is stunning, the flower arrangement breathtaking. Requests have been answered immediatly and to our fullest satisfaction. The location is perfect: one is only a few steps away from Orchard Road, other highlights of the city can be reached fast and easily. Although our stay was a bit a mix between business and leisure, we were able to enjoy the (two!) pools which gave us a feeling of pure holiday relaxation.

Perfect Hotel with which to Pamper Yourself,WadeJZ,We were taken care of and staff went out of their way to meet our special needs regarding a late check out.  The pools and gym were excellent.

A Discreet Home Away from Home with excellent service,Clive L,"The hotel has a warm clubby traditional feeling, and the service and decor reflect this. This is not a glitzy hotel but one of refinement ,reliability and tradition. This is obvious by the nature and quality of the service which is considerate and efficient. We were there during Chinese New Year and service at breakfast did struggle a bit but this was more due to large families arriving and being rather demanding. We were upgraded to a large comfortable suite which you can not fault and the chamber maids were exceptional, old fashion service. If you want a sedate elegant and charming Hotel this is for you",5,,

A dining disappointment,WDN,The hotel was up to 4 seasons standards except for it‚Äôs starred Michelin restaurant.  The staff were extremely pleasant and the food extremely uninteresting.

Our 5 year old twins were warmly welcomed and we appreciated all the special touches for them (kids' bathrobes, toiletries etc). The Suite was spacious, beds were comfortable and bathrooms were perfect.  The hospitality here shows a special willingness to go above and beyond. When one night our daughter's favourite dish was not available and my wife expressed disappointment to the in-room dining, they went above and beyond to source the ingredients from outside the hotel and make it specially for her. They even surprised her with a gift and a cake to make up for the temporary disappointment. This was a great approach to resolve what was in reality not much of a problem‚Ä¶",5,,

Of particular note was the excellent staff we encountered at every step - Porter‚Äôs, check-in, concierge, room service... and the housekeeping was immaculate.

Staff are courteous and professional while also discrete. It‚Äôs well maintained despite its age, and is slowly being refurbished (the rooms have all been facelifted, while the one-ninety has been elegantly refurbished).   The third floor fitness and spa facilities are generous (complimentary drinks and fruits) and comforting (although the gym could do with a bit of a refurbishment as well).   A special thanks to the highly professional Christopher at reception.   I look forward to my next stay here!",5,,
Amazing stay,Dulani Guruge,I stayed with my family during a recent visit to Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.

As such, the focal point of the wedding for the guests was really the food and service of the Four Seasons staff. Despite having to take the weight of the focus, the Four Seasons staff were superb and made our wedding celebration a great success and a delight for us and our guests.

"Excellent service, quality hotel",Jet60531173092,"Service was excellent, the team made every effort to make us feel welcomed - personalising at every possible turn (remembering our names, leaving snacks in the room etc). It‚Äôs also very cool that there is an app allowing you to communicate with the hotel from your phone. Highly recommend the Four Seasons. Would stay again. ",5,,
Beautiful Oasis,KitKat1238,Stayed here for almost a week while on business. Beautifully renovated rooms and great location near all of Orchard Road shopping. Food in main restaurant was delicious and varied with a magnificent breakfast buffet. Less of a fan of the bar food. Outside terrace with water features is beautiful. Staff friendly and warm. Had a wonderful stay and would love the opportunity to come back.,5,,
Setting high standards,Pioneer48467838200,"Luxurious hotel with superb personal customer service from all staff, from concierge, reception staff, room service and cleaners. Every encounter was a positive and warm one. I travelled with my husband and three sons and we were all extremely comfortable and satisfied during our stay at the Four Seasons which was a recommendation from my sister who is well travelled. Glad to know that it met and exceeded my expectations.Thank you to all for a lovely stay. ",5,,
Fabulous Four Seasons ,BRODIE02,"We booked this hotel as we had a 3 night stopover before flying to Auckland New Zealand during our stay the staff were amazing, friendly, helpful and considerate. Delicious breakfast and clean comfortable room. Also great service at the rooftop pool - Beautiful orchids displayed in the lobby - I would definitely stay again. ",5,,
A Luxury Hotel with Warm Service ,toohill50,"We stayed 6 nights at the Four Seasons prior to a cruise.  Our room was perfect with a great view of downtown, comfortable chairs and a couch, great shower and two sinks in the bathroom.  The breakfast buffet is the best one we‚Äôve ever had and we‚Äôve done a lot of traveling.  We particularly enjoyed the Asian specialties, the smoked fish, and the homemade bread.  We sat out on the terrace which manages to give a tropical oasis feel even though you are on a busy street.  We had several other meals at the hotel including dinner at the Chinese restaurant, a regular restaurant dinner, a lunch, and cocktails during their aperitif hour where they serve charcuterie, spreads, and other antipasti.  All meals were very good. The specialty cocktails were good.  We really enjoyed the‚Ä¶",5,,
Truly Special,K chan,We have been fortunate as a family to stay in some wonderful hotels around the world over the last two years. And the standard we keep referring to is the four seasons in Singapore. The hotel is absolutely lovely in terms of the physical but why we so look forward to staying at this hotel is because we are treated like friends that have not seen each other for a while. We have just had the privilege of staying for 10 nights and it was again such a special experience.   You won't be treated like a number here and if you take the effort you can make connections with the staff that makes the whole experience something really wonderful. They have essentially kept all their staff particularly from the concierge and bar/restaurant over the last two years which is amazing in this time‚Ä¶,5,,
Beautiful Hotel,Lizzi J,"The Four Seasons in Singapore is absolutely beautiful and very modern. The amenities are great, especially the rooftop pool and breakfast buffet. The staff are all extremely thoughtful and attentive. The room was spotless, very comfortable, and homey. The location of the hotel was also great - a short drive from downtown and near many restaurants, bars, and shopping. ",5,,
Luxury redefined,Cintamuzika,"First time staying here, albeit for one night only and it was a great experience. Because it was such a short stay, I cannot comment about the restaurants but will heartily recommend the staff and service provided. The room was decadent in style, and even though I just stayed in a ‚Äústandard room‚Äù, it certainly had me oooohing and aaaahing.",4,,
Great hotel,832MJB,"A most enjoyable stay with but one disappointment- the advertising for the hotel lists B&B charges at $470/night and deliberately omits the extra $80/night unavoidable taxes, meaning you‚Äôre actually paying $550/night when you get there",5,,
Refined elegance perfect location,andibagus2016,"We have stayed many times at this hotel , rooms have been refurbished and are tasteful ,comfortable with great beds and large bathrooms . The location is perfect for shopping and access to orchard road , check in and out were seamless ",5,,
A tropical paradise,DavidNeil_11,"Its perhaps the greenery and the outside bar with its sounds of nature that makes the Four Seasons on of the few remaining hotels in Singapore with a ""tropical"" character. Its quietly situated but close to Orchard Road and the life of the City. It also has a very traditional approach to comfort and outstanding service, with excellent rooms and a couple of wonderful restaurants. In years gone by I stayed when on business; this trip was for leisure en route back to the UK - it was perhaps my best hotel experience in several years. I enjoyed every moment!",5,,
Dinner buffet at four points eatery,Ilovesg,Chef alan tan was extremely commendable. He constantly took the effort to have short conversations with customers to ask if the food was to their liking and how he could improve further. He took criticisms constructively:),5,,
Fantastic,GTfivestar,"We stayed a few nights pre Christmas. We had a small issue with a noisy air conditioner however like any good brand they more than made up for it.  The rooms, food and service was superb.  We will be back!",5,,
Nice Hotel.  Lovely Rooms. Not so great Concierge,ChaiLady,We stayed here at the end of January.  It's a nice hotel with lovely rooms but the concierge are not very knowledgeable and that makes it hard to get advice on where to go etc.  Don't recommend the overpriced Chinese Restaurant.  I'm not sure how it got a Michelin Star because it really is very ordinary.,3,,
Not up to standard,Jeordie84,"The hotel location is great, the staff are wonderful but the food is such a massive let down.  Staff were exceptional, room large, housekeeping went above and beyond.  The restaurant was being refurbished during our stay - on day 1 it felt almost as though i had rocked up at a premier inn - a huge 'queue'. Kudos to the staff who dealt with it very calmly, efficiently and made different arrangements for the following day. The food, however, really left a nasty taste in our mouths - nobody looks forward to a hotel breakfast as much as I do, it really signifies being on holiday for me. Breakfast on both days was just a mess, the only live station was for eggs. Everything was wholly unappetizing and lacked any real appeal. Indian food was mixed up with american breakfast, beans‚Ä¶",2,,
Amazingly thoughtful and gracious,mza455,"This Christmas, I was traveling with my family to Singapore from San Francisco and were booked at the four seasons for 4 nights (for 2 rooms).    We had a special prepaid rate.  Literally, the day of travel, we had a total travel snafu and couldn't leave.    And the earliest we could rebook was 2 days later - cutting our trip short by 2 days - and leaving us only 2 days in Singapore.  I called the Four Seasons to let them know, and they were exceedingly nice and proactively told me to not worry - that they will bill me for only 2 days and still honor the special prepaid rate that i had - even though I was calling them the day we were supposed to arrive.  It was so over and above the call of duty.    We like the Four Seasons due to the great service, but this was a step beyond. ‚Ä¶",5,,
Best hotel in Singapore,Bernice Sim,"Best hotel I've stayed in Singapore. Held my wedding here in 2016, and had two nights of Bridal Suite allocated to us. Service was impeccable, rooms were clean and additional pillows were given on our requests. I love how the food was excellent there, from the semi buffet at One-Ninety restaurant, to our three course meal on our second night of stay. It was amazing.  My husband and I went back again in June 2018 to celebrate our anniversary and nothing changed. Everything was still up to standard or even better. When we had our dinner at the restaurant, the servers made an effort to remember our names which we thought was a very good personal touch.   Last time we were here, it was in November 2018 for a wedding. My mother-in-law wasn't in the best of health hence didn't want to‚Ä¶",5,,
Not good enough!,Edwin K,Need some face lift... Why no complimentary carpark? For knob at the bathroom door missing..  Toiletries not sufficient.. No shaving kit. but overall room is good but expect the standard of Four Seasons to be above many other hotel chains.. Therefore not impressed..,4,,
Not as good as before ,Luxtrave11er,"Nothing major to complain about but it isn‚Äôt as good as it used to be.  Rooms are nicely refurbished although not particularly impactful or luxurious - no wow. Hallways are not refurbished which is weird as the decor is beige and dull in the hallways and blue and fresh in the rooms.  Some of the doormen are still there from the old days. Nice and helpful enough but the polish and slickness is gone.  Main restaurant closed for refurbishment, bar really really needs a refurb too. The Spa looks like something from the 80s.   It seems they are making small decor changes but the owner doesn‚Äôt seem to have made the same investments in this hotel and it‚Äôs showing.   Overall it‚Äôs ok - I‚Äôd stay here again for the location, but not so much for the decor and the service doesn‚Äôt quite make‚Ä¶",4,,
Outstanding,Sarah H,"this hotel is right in the middle of the famous street that is Orchid drive shopping centre were if you love to shop this hotel is right up your street. The hotel is beautiful we arrived early so did not expect our room to be ready as we arrived at 10 am , we had to wait a short time so we made the most of singapore and ventured out. our room was located on the 16th floor with not the best view as we overlooked the car park but our suite was incredible we had a beautiful lounge area with a huge tv , two toilets, and the most fantastic bathroom the shower was powerful and if you favour a shower over a bath you will not be dissappointed . the bed was so inviting big with the best pillows . the bed just hugs you and we really did enjoy sleeping in it? with a tv also in the bedroom‚Ä¶",5,,
My favorite Singapore Escape,Melody Carstairs,"Without a doubt, Four Seasons, Singapore, is a class above. It is a 5 star hotel with a boutique feel.  There is nothing I can fault, from the front desk, to housekeeping, to the barman.   I visit Singapore a few times a year, I love that they remember me with every visit.   Yes, I reccommend the Four Seasons. ",5,,
As always it exceeded expectations ,skm2012,"We arrived yesterday afternoon and were received by no less than Sherona, the manager herself who opened the door of the hotel for us and took us to our room herself along with her front desk staff. This was FS service par for course.  My daughter got a FS teddy bear (but of course) and the staff were racing to see who could do it first. That‚Äôs just incredible. When we got to our room, we were taken aback that the front desk lady knew we needed a stool for the bathroom sink for our daughter to use and presto it was there in the evening, there was toothbrush and toothpaste for our wee daughter as well as even bath gel for her too. As usual the slippers were: one for him, one for her and one for the daughter. The room was brilliant; an executive suite which is phenomenal. There‚Ä¶",5,,

World traveler,Flyer37392872607,This experience was very disappointing.I could have been in any 4star Hilton.Staff were friendly.But the whole hotel needs a major refurb and the housekeeping needs a good shake up.And they definatly didn‚Äôt address a major problem with the airconditioning properly.!!The bar area is very nice  the terrace outside the bar area is however unwelcoming and basic!but the breakfast area  is really awful. And depressing.,2,,
really top class,brandenburg5,"We stayed here on both legs of our trip. Both stays were perfect. We booked through Four Seasons and got a 3 for 2 deal, which was nice. On arrival, we were offered a breakfast deal, which was not particularly cheap but we were so glad we took it. We've stayed in luxury hotels in many countries, but this was by far the most amazing hotel breakfast we've ever had. The variety of Western and Asian foods was just unbelievable. I'm a baker and even the fresh sourdough bread was fantastic.   The room was very large (SO rare in Singapore) and of course the location near Orchard Road and the MRT Is fantastic. We slept perfectly.  The only disappointment was our dinner at the Chinese restaurant, which I will review separately.",5,,
Still tops,manchesterianBangkok,"Having stayed here on numerous occasions it feels like coming home,the staff are very accommodating and genuinely seemed happy to welcome me back. Some if not all the rooms were recently refurbished in a classic way. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped.

Nice boutique hotel in quiet location,docletran,"This is our first stay in Four Seasons Singapore and it will not be the last . The Check in was delayed but the check-in agent took my mobile phone number and informed us straightaway when one of the room was ready unlike at Mandarin Oriental Marina Bay who kept us waiting for 2 hours then only acted when I threatened to cancel my reservation ( an apology was made later by the hotel management ) . The breakfast was nice and pleasant . The staff in particular our waiter , Tamil and the restaurant manager , Ivan were friendly . The rooms ( cheapest category) were luxurious and large . We are definitely coming back to the Four Seasons again and recommend our fellow travellers to do the same",5,,
Pre CNY getaway,CCHCHo,"The hotel is a stone throw away from the glamorous Orchard Street, quiet and accessible. The rooms and public area is maintained well in a timeless decor. I quite like the non intrusive service of the hotel initially, though after 3 days upon approaching the front desk we were still unnoticed is kind of surprising. It is a good experience for any business hotel, but with the Four Seasons brand name, we kind of expected a bit more.",4,,
Headache not peaceful,Patrick S,"They ruined all the magic by taking 1000 SGD deposit without even telling me. They took this deposit from my bank account very fast, the same day we checkin, but they now claim it'll take 10 business days to give it back to me. The problem is that 1) they did that without mentioning it 2) this is an extra headache to look after now with some phone calls and emails and bank account checks. Extra headache is the exact opposite of what I expect when I go enjoy a nice hotel with family.",1,,
Excellent Hotel,FarAway44171575012,"Great place to stay in Singapore, awesome location,  friendly courteous staff, excellent breakfast buffet, and well maintained luxurious facility.

Home away from home,Anna I,"My top hotel choice for trips to Singapore.  The renovated rooms are modern, clean, and spacious. And moreover, the staff go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and cared for.  For instance, the staff remembered that I'd commented on their pillows being too soft during my last stay.  When I arrived in my room, firm pillows had been prepared, and they made all the difference to my sleep quality.  ",5,,
Excellent hotel food location service ,Sheikh M,I stayed in singapore Four seasons for the first time and was very very happy with the hotel. The location is excellent just few min walks from main orchard road and ION. Rooms are big and good amenities and fixtures. Rooms are big and bathrooms are beautiful and big. Reception service is prompt and restaurants offers good food. I tried the lobby level restaurant and level 2 Cantonese restaurant both were good and Cantonese restaurant was too good. Only on this room cleaning service need little attention on the day I checked out I gave ‚Äúclean up my room‚Äù at around 11:00 am and despite giving reminder to the floor cleaning person it was not cleaned till I checked out at 4/00 pm. It sounded little surprising to me in presence of such a good hotel with excellent service elsewhere .,5,,

The staff  couldn‚Äôt do enough for us! They seemed to be able to anticipate our needs.

Outstanding Elegance!,terpjohn,"Our stay at this hotel couldn‚Äôt have been more seamless. If location is an issue, you can walk to all the great shopping on Orchard Road. Everything else is a short taxi ride. Singapore is very small. The property is lovely. The rooms are spacious and the staff seems to anticipate your needs. They have a nice spa and a good workout room. They have a great Chinese restaurant and the bar is beautiful and has a fun menu. The best is the staff. A concierge team that cant seem to do enough for you and a thoughtful housekeeping staff who asked, after we‚Äôd left the do not disturb light on if in the future they should clean the room if they know we are out of the hotel even if the light is on. Stay here. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!",5,,
Quiet and personal,Cranny,"I stayed with my two teenage girls for 6 nights.  We had joining rooms on the 12th Floor. Much research went into this holiday including pressure from my girls to stay at Marina Bay Sands...probably because they thought it was more Instagramable !  I never regretted for a moment choosing this hotel.  The Hotel is in a lush part of the city.  The building and decor is quality as are the staff.  Professionals at their jobs.  We frequented the 3rd floor pool mostly rather than the top floor.  It was peaceful and had a decent spa...plus I could do laps.  The staff were on first name basis after a day or so. The gym is awesome with excellent equipment, towels , water ...everything you might expect from a 5 star hotel.  Location is set back from the main roads and shopping areas but‚Ä¶",5,,
Good location near Orchard Road,BigSur707,"I come to Singapore a lot.  This is the first time I stayed in this hotel.  Overall, a good impression.

Two pools, one on the roof, the other on the third floor.  Third floor pool is a lap pool and quite large.  Room was in good condition.  Large bathroom.  Everything in good working order.

The room was beautiful and spotlessly clean, the breakfast as good as any I‚Äôve experienced. But what really sets the Four Seasons apart is their staff and their unobtrusive desire to make your stay all that it can be, nothing is too much trouble. Outstanding in every way, thank you for a memorable ending to a wonderful holiday.",5,,
Excellent stay at Four Seasons,nuyihS,"Exceptional service at Four Seasons. Staff at restaurant overheard that it was mybirthday and delivered a complimentary cake.

Fantastic stay in Singapore,DDCTravels,"Stayed for three nights at the Four Seasons Singapore and can't wait to return. Service was impeccable  from the moment I stepped out of my car and checked-in to the moment I checked-out. The hotel is in great condition, with rooms spacious and clean. It is well-located, within walking distance of shopping (e.g. less than 5 minutes from ION Orchard) and the MRT, but still offers a calm oasis away from the traffic and crowds.  One Ninety has a beautiful breakfast buffet, varying its selection each morning. The staff was wonderful, making sure that this jet-lagged, caffeine-deprived zombie turns into a human by the time she leaves for meetings. A few double shots of espresso and sufficient encouragement to return to the buffet for seconds and thirds go a long way! And they do run‚Ä¶",5,,
stop over,Yulia S,"Stayed in this hotel in September, both on my way to Europe and back. This was my sixth trip to Singapore and every time I tried a different hotel to compare with others. I thought it was perfect - rooms are spacious, excellent breakfast choice, attention to detail. The only small minus is the size of the pool, however if you go there after breakfast during the week there is no one there. Overall very happy!",5,,
Amazing Amazing Amazing,lynh564,"My recent 6 night stay at Four Seasons Hotel was one of the best experiences I have ever had.

Great location and Wonderful service,Well Planned Travel,"Four Seasons is an easy bet and you pretty much know what to expect. FS Singapore ticks the box.  Close to Orchard road, easy flowing service, newly updated rooms and good food.   Yes not the cheapest properties but then again if you looking for cheap then skip these brands. If you wish to have attention to detail then go ahead and book.",5,,
"Brilliant service, top notch Four Seasons property",Londonfoodie88,"We have stayed here on a number of occasions.  On this visit, we stayed in a Boulevard Room on the 12th floor (room 1217).  The rooms have been upgraded with improved technology (large television, excellent lighting controls). The shower has been greatly improved with the most easy-to-use controls.  The service as before was outstanding right from the porters through to the management team.  The location is convenient to Orchard Road.  Breakfast offer is wide ranging with high quality produce.  The Four Seasons Singapore is a great hotel in this exemplary group of some of the finest hotels in the world.",5,,

Fabulous !!,Claire_Keriman,"Fabulously outstanding experience staying at this magnificent hotel in Singapore.  I have 50 years of international travel experiences all over the world, and I can truly write that the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore exceeded my expectations, especially for location with limited and very expensive space.  The manager of the hotel as well as all the staff treated us royally.  I highly recommend the Four Season Hotel Singapore !!!  More than 5 stars !  We had 2 rooms, both fine, for our 3 generations, including my teen grandchildren.  We all loved our stay at this outstanding hotel.",5,,
Adequate stay ,MTWT,It was nice that our room was upgraded by the hotel during the F1 weekends as the hotel rooms have been overbooked. The suite room is spacious with one bed room and in the corner overlooking views of the city with open scenery. The outdoor swimming pool and the next indoor gym however look outdated and have not been upgraded for many years. Adequate equipments but reminded me the ages of this property.  The location of Four Seasons is slightly far away from the busy F1 event hence the traffic has not been too bad.  ,4,,
Excellent Stay,ssamra,I stayed for three nights and got an early check to a very well appointed room - truly Four Seasons standard. Hotel is in a quite area but very close to orchid road. Very responsive staff offering great personalised service. Would definitely like to stay here again.,5,,

All You Can Expect From A Four Seasons ,Juan B,"This Four Seasons is not an exception of quality and luxury, spa was very nice, breakfast also with Indian and Chinese flavors, also American options.

Always on point.,OZENO,Excellent excellent concierge. I didn‚Äôt get the name of the female concierge but she helped me from movie suite tickets to hard to get dinner reservation to avoidance of tours traps and suggestions of local mom and pop dining places. 4S delivered and more. The bed was supper comfy which was a nice change from Leela Palace in New Delhi. The breakfast was excellent and after spending time in Delhi I acquired a craving for Masala chai which they accomodated (30 min prep time). To access orchard road us the link walkway between four seasons and the Hilton.,5,,
Wonderful place to stay,Grant O,"Singapore has lots of great hotels but the service and attitude of the staff at the Four Seasons lift it above most 5 star hotels in town. The Food at the Chinese restaurant is superb.  The views, decor and facilities aren‚Äôt as outstanding as some other hotels in town but the rooms were very comfortable and the amenities as expected from a Four Seasons.  I‚Äôll definitely stay here again.  ",5,,

Business felt like leisure,nbbii91,"Went on a business trip but it felt like a short getaway. The staff were friendly and hospitable, they made me feel comfortable and valued. The whole hotel ambiance was very relaxing. I especially loved that I could connect my iPhone to the TV and that there was a speaker in the bathroom so you could listen to music or the news or your podcasts while you soak in the bath tub! The decoration, furnishings and amenities were well thought out. The gym was also well equipped and just enough for one to continue their fitness routine while away from home. I don‚Äôt think I want to stay at any other hotel for my future trips! ",5,,
Highly Recommended to everyone,tripleCs,"The newly renovated room was very nice and the entire hotel had a nice atmosphere.  It is conveniently located, just few minutes walk from Orchard Road.

Amazing hotel staff amazing ,Campaf,"We are currently staying here for 4 nights. My husband needed a Dr our first morning and they organised and booked his Dr appointment and transport and also continued to check on him (they could have also got a Dr to come to our room). The rooms are very comfy and nice, all have just been refurbished. The extra bed added for our son is also really comfy.  Room service from the Chinese restaurant was beautiful. We also booked our universal world tickets from reception which saved us lots of time.   Also two really nice lounge areas with free coffee and snacks.   We will be back because the staff are amazing, great location and easy to walk to yummy affordable food options and the rooms are 10/10.",5,,

Re : Not Good Enough,BENLEE123,"I had a 2 night stay at Four Seasons Singapore which I booked through a virtuoso agent. The rooms at Four Seasons have just undergone a thorough renovation. I booked an Executive Suite. I usually prefer the Ritz Carlton but decided to try the Four Seasons for a change.  Arrival  I arrived by taxi. On arrival, check-in was quick but the lady reception I felt wasn‚Äôt very friendly. I was given the room keys ( room 1407 ) and that‚Äôs it. No escort to room. Upon entering my suite, I was repulsed by the strong smell of paint in it. I called the reception to complain, the same lady that checked me in. Her immediate response was the hotel was fully booked and she offered to send me some air fresheners instead. I told her the smell of paint was very strong and clearly the room has just‚Ä¶",3,,
Perfect for a city hotel!,NataNyoman,"I visit Singapore regularly and always stay on Orchard Road. However, this time I decided to stay here due to the fact that my usual hotel is getting too crowded and was becoming just a number. However, this is not the case at the Four Seasons. The staff is lovely and the hotel is small enough to feel intimate, despite the fact it's Four Seasons. Hands down, my nicest experience staying here amongst the hordes of other hotels. I will be returning shortly....",5,,
Pleasant surprise ,oren3417,I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. A really good 5* hotel.  The service by all the staff is very attentive.  Just to mention 2 things: the wifi not so strong all the time in the room. In my opinion the breakfast is overpriced and there are many options outside.  Despite those 2 things I highly recommend this hotel.,5,,
A Pampering Staycation,Sandy C,"The deluxe room was spacious and the bathroom was beautifully designed. Little things like Loccitane toiletries, TWG tea, Bose sound system and comfortable bedroom slippers made the short staycation a pampering treat. More importantly, they served delicious breakfast of bread and butter, with four choices of jam. If you're looking for a stress-relieving experience, staying at Four Seasons may be worth every penny.",5,,
A nice stay but jit as other 4 seasons ,Ronygr,"We came for a few days. The rooms are nice. And service is good. But. We just visited four seasons Seoul, snd there us nothing to compare. It us not as good. First, few times they did not come for turn down service , efrngjough the sign.eas on. Everytime we had to.adk for more soap. We got 2 bananas in the room the whole week. Better they wouldn't give anything. The service in the pool is limited and they font go atop d with some special things to make it fun (go to fukkeryon bay and kesrn) So all in all it was ok, but MIT more than that for this class of hotel. But no.mistajes, the hotel us good and people are friendly and helpful.  It just lacks the extra.you expect. ",4,,
Our favorite hotel in the world.,Stefania_P_11_11,"This is our favorite hotel in the world. It was our fifth stay ay the Four Seasons Singapore which is, to us, our veritable home away from home. I will explain in three words to those who are looking for the perfect hotel in Singapore why they would definitely pick Four Seasons.  First and foremost, service.  Four Seasons Singapore provides the best service possible, so either you are travelling for leisure or for business this would always be the best asset any hotel can offer.  Secondarily, quality.  Four Seasons Singapore provides quality in every possible aspect. They won‚Äôt just cook your breakfast, they will cook you the best breakfast with the best ingredient available and they will serve it to you with care and flawless professionalism. They won‚Äôt just make up your room,‚Ä¶",5,,
Beautiful Singapore!,biondidibiondi,"We stayed here 3 nights on a business trip and had an overall good stay.  The hotel is located in the center of a super-crowded city with crazy rhythms.  It‚Äôs worth the money cause the rates are not that high but there were certain issues that you can‚Äôt avoid.  The room service was always a bit late and the breakfast was average.   The service was good but not like other four season hotels that we have been to , we didn‚Äôt had the feeling that we were being taken care of and this happens to many ‚Äúbig‚Äù luxurious hotels.  The housekeeping was exceptionally good compared to the other departments of the hotel.  The room was modern and always tidy.   ",4,,
Fantastic experience,ranabir2017,"4 seasons made our stay extremely memorable and special. Everything in the Hotel was perfect, the food, the stay, the location.

Singapore - Four Seasons of Smoke Smell,Rey B,"My Four Seasons stay in Singapore got spoiled by rooms with smoke smell -despite being in a non smoking room and floor.  Two of my four stays at the Four Seasons in Singapore, I got burned by ‚Äúsmoky‚Äù rooms.   Great property, great service but disappointed that in my last stay they would not change me rooms but rather insist on lending me an air purifier machine. It did not work. Unfortunately, there is not a customer loyalty program at Four Seasons and despite me being a Four Seasons world frequent guest -I am the same among all guests.  To give them credit, I heard the smokers issue is a common problem in all hotels in Asia. Guests don‚Äôt respect the non-smoking policy but, I must also admit, that American hotels seem to do a better job at enforcing it. There are some hotels‚Ä¶",3,,
Top of the top customer service and kid friendly,Betsy T,Wow! What a blessing to be well treated while traveling with children! As anyone who does travel with children knows...the experience is challenging enough and not very much fun without friendly faces! You can sure find them at Four Seasons Orchard in Singapore! From the unending graciousness of Ivan Martinez who hosts the dining room to Gladys and Sean in the conscierge services we could not have been treated more like family! In addition the food and accommodations were outstanding and it was fabulously located in the middle of everything!!!,5,,
Exceptional service.,rochelle702,"From arrival to departure the service at Four Seasons Singapore was exceptional. They exceeded my expectations and met all my family's needs.

The perfect recovery after a busy biz trips ,MariHiya,"Whenever I can, I try to stay at Four Seasons because of many reasons. This stay in Singapore at Four Seasons didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all despite a construction just next to the hotel. The quality of cares from staffs that I received was excellent and they made me feel being at home. I felt that I was well taken care of by the whole team. The bed is always excellent and FS‚Äôs bed is one of my favourites.  I used all facilities, spa & treatment, swimming pool, gym, restaurants and bar. I felt very comfortable and relaxed staying even if just one night. 2 Restaurants and the bar served fantastic food, teas, sweets and drinks. Staffs were very accommodating. I will definitely stay here again during the upcoming next biz trip.",5,,
Great Views & Central,Mark K,"Washed up here for a night before going to somewhere less swishy.   Very impressive place, right down town next to all the malls (if you like that sort of thing).  Usual 4-seasons great service ; got me into room early (no hassle) as I came of an overnight flight.   Stunning views from corner room (see pics).  Beds v high quality (reminded me of Buneos Aires one).  Highly recommended.",5,,
"Once again, not disappointed",RobT,"We love coming back to the Four Seasons Singapore, because they are consistent.   The service here is seamless, friendly, and genuine.

Our Virtuoso upgrade was declined this stay, it must have been a very busy weekend for the property, but we still had a lovely updated boulevard view room.

Just wonderful,AKW52245,We went here for my husband's birthday. Everything was top notch. The spa staff even sang happy birthday and gave him a rich piece of cake.

Very enjoyable stay! ,GSK_Pharma,"Four seasons Hotel is my favourite staycation choice and the reason is although it is located in the city centre, it is slightly away from the hustle and bustle of the crowd.

The cleanliness level of the room is impeccable and whenever we make requests for amenities, the housekeeping/concierge will be very accommodating to make it possible in most efficient way!

Extraordinary Staff is One of the Kind,Perlee,"We stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore for 5 nights July 3-July 8.  Location is within walking distance to ION mall, Takashimaya and other stores, restaurants along the Orchard Road.

We stayed at the Boulevard View Room at 18th floor using our Amex Platinum Fine Hotel and Resorts for reservation.   My family and I traveled a lot and have stayed at many luxurious establishments in the past. However so far, Singapore Four Seasons is the only one that made our stay so memorable and special, and it was because of its wonderful staff at the One-Ninety Restaurant especially Ms. Shou Wei and Mei Yin.

A more personalized helpful service ,Stephania Astrapia,"Location is perfect: seated in a more quiet neighborhood, second layer from the busy Orchard Rd. And yet they have direct, air conditioned access to Hilton which is at Orchard Rd.

Hospitable staffs, and got swift, helpful answer when I used their chat service in their apps. Room is quite spacious, with good and complete amenities - also clean. Really like their color pallete used for the bedroom.  Unlike some - other 5stars hotel in the area: their lobby is more private and intimate.

My Favorite Hotel In Singapore,KTraveler17,"Stayed here for 5 nights on a recent business trip. Having stayed at several of the top hotels in Singapore in the past (Intercontinental, Fairmont, etc), this is by far my favorite hotel in Singpore. The level of service from the staff is truly exceptional. I have idea how they train everyone to know your name- it's really impressive.  Food is great, the newly refurbished rooms are well thought out and extremely quiet and again, the level of service is really amazing. Staff did an excellent job of anticipating my needs before I could even ask for things. For example, I was in need of tooth paste and used the small tube from the dental kit.

Very nice hotel; outstanding service and very good location;  Nothing super special though;,doberman32,"I really liked this hotel very much;  Four Seasons is probably the best chain of hotels around for a reason.  Amazing beds, which one can purchase by the way.  Big room and the front desk could not do enough for us throughout our stay.  Two very average swimming pools were kind of odd.  Very good breakfast, as is typical for the Four Seasons;  As another reviewer put it, this hotel is really solid and nice, but without a wow factor--not really unique in any way, save for really good service and comfort if that makes sense.  It seemed a bit outdated in some ways, though I did really enjoy the hotel.",4,,
Solid hotel without the wow factor ,jaydee,"Title says it all really, hard to fault the hotel really, but at the same time nothing special for the money.

"16 nights at Four Seasons.  Fantastic service, nice rooms.",Florentine_Gourmet,"Just spent 16 nights in a Boulevard room.  Overall, after the renovation, this is clearly one of the best choices in Singapore.  Given the spectacular service, it is clearly superior to the Ritz Carlton, JW Marriott, Fairmont, Sofitel, or Marina Bay Sands (all of which I have stayed at).  Only complaint: the reservation promised a room upgrade based upon availability.¬† Upon check-in, no room upgrade was offered, even though their web site showed availability.  So, just assume that any such promises are worthless.  * Room  The renovated rooms are very nice indeed.  Very airy; nice furniture; all the outlets you could need; great TV.  One downside: limited closet space, so I had to leave a few items in my suitcase.  * Service  Absolutely spectacular.  They immediately learnt my‚Ä¶",4,,
4- Night in The Four Seasons Singapore,Thavtan,"I experienced a super service of the room attendance on noticing that I used a computer mouse on glass table without any mouse pad which was inconvenience, so she/he brought me a mouse pad and left a message.

Where everybody knows your name,MRSMannersPortland,"The Four Seasons Singapore isn‚Äôt the most flashy and modern hotel choice that you can make in Singapore but it is absolutely elegant and perfect. From our airport pick up, to a swift and pleasant check-in to check out, the whole process was smooth and very pleasant. We enjoyed easy access to SMRT for day trips, a very convenient mall and food court, a lovely hotel bar, high tea and afternoons at the rooftop pool. Everyone at the hotel was friendly, attentive and knew who we were. Housekeeping was excellent. I highly recommend you stay here, relax and be pampered while exploring Singapore! Four Seasons never disappoints! ",5,,
First visit to Singapore,JohnjohnCruz,"This was our first trip to Singapore, there were so many hotels to choose from with awesome reviews it made it hard to choose. In the end we decided to stick with what we knew and booked our stay with Four Seasons, Singapore.  I'm traveling with my family and wanted a hotel that was focused on family but still provided that luxurious ambiance that takes your breath away.   Several days before our trip, Ali Alsagoff, the  Guest Experience & Concierge Manager contacted us and asked if we needed anything prepared in advance for our stay and like all the other FS properties, he asked for our daughters name so he could make sure the stay for her was personalized.   We opted to have the FS hotel cars pick us up at the airport; they have different vehicles to select from. We selected‚Ä¶",5,,

Good solid Four Seasons,Picardnj,"I was fortunate enough to stay in a King room that was recently renovated. Great room and an easy 2 day stay. I always find that when dealing with a 12 hr time change certain simple tasks can become quite complicated. In this case it was the lighting and trying to locate all the relevant switches. I am a regular in high end hotels and I am generally pretty familiar with all the lighting subtleties but when jet lagged I can sometimes get stumped. In this case, the room has multiple light switches which allow for different dimming levels. Additionally, there are manual switch reading lights, bed lamps and desk lamps. What should be an easy one touch exercise before bed becomes a 'light hunt.' Please read this with a sense of humor and context of jet lag. There was another issue‚Ä¶",4,,

Nice hotel right in the middle of city,sats71,"Stay three nights at four seasons this week to attend a conference. The building is not the most modern at first glance, probably because it has been there for long enough. My check in was pretty smooth and was given a room on higher floor, as I like it.

I'd like to echo what most of the other reviews here are saying. Slightly older hotel but absolutely fine if you get one of the refurbished rooms - they're great! Warm service throughout from the doorman to the front desk to the cleaning staff. Everyone seems genuinely happy to be working there. And finally, it's in a great spot.

Excellent!,Dr David Vishnu Kumar,Can't wait to get back here and be pampered by the lush rooms and delicious food.  I have to mention the breakfast spread that was absolutely perfect.

Food selection and quality was as expedted at FS.  The reason i dont give it 5/5 is that it does not give the same grand feeling that imo many FS hotels gives.

The only exemption was the overzealous waiter who cleared my table at breakfast when I had gone to get some bread!

Feels like coming home!,ladybugwanderer,"I'd have to literally be peeled away from this hotel every time I'm in Singapore. Everyone feels like family, particularly the gentlemen at Guest Services (luggage services) and the always helpful Concierge. Location is fantastic - seconds from Orchard Road, but hidden away for privacy and peace. Food - we've only ever done Room Service, but custom orders and every single time, without fail, they've accommodated us (we're in Singapore 4-5 times a year).",5,,
An impressive hotel experience I would highly recommend to those seeking something special,Linda K,"The Four Seasons Hotel, Singapore, is an exceptional hotel in terms of amenities etc. but what stands out for me is the level of care and attention one receives from the hotel staff, at every level.

One of a kind,chrisfromaustria2018,"There are many good Hotel in Singapore, but Four Season is different it feels  not like in a Hotel, it feels like home. I have the feeling the management thinks a lot what can be done better than in other Hotels. But the Staff is so nice one of a kind ! ",5,,

"A good stay, but lacks something...",PhillipP,"I was a little bit disappointed by my stay at the Four Seasons. Located just behind Orchard Street, it is only a five minute walk from Orchard MRT station.   Check in and out were both smooth. My room was spacious with a large, comfortable bed. Overall, the decor is nicely understated, with wood and light marble. The room had a large bathroom with separate tub and shower. Unfortunately, the shower needed some TLC, as parts of the sealant were coming off and with it, small pieces of marble. In addition, the shower handle was a little temperamental.   Breakfast consisted of a large buffet with many cold and hot options from across the globe. Unfortunately, there was not enough room to sit all customers and on one occasion I was asked to sit across by the bar/cafe. This was not the‚Ä¶",4,,

They kept a look out for baby as it was slightly drizzling. The rooms were neat and nice. Overall the best hotel stay I had since I started staycationing 3 yrs ago.

The interior decor is also amazing, every visit to the hotel in the lead up to our wedding was a visual treat in the form of the constantly changing floral decorations in the lobby.

I will let that go and move on to the positives.  I will give high marks for many of the staff...the lady that manages the top level pool, the pastry chef...she is lovely and that takes me to the breakfast, just fantastic.

A very good hotel up to four seasons standard,AmitRoadster,"The only comment I might have is that there isn't anything surprising about the Four Season Singapore - you get what you come to expect from Four Seasons hotels... Comfortable, spacious rooms, everything in perfect shape, great service for anything you might need. Gym and pool are up to date with all the top equipment, clean and well maintained. When I was sitting near the pool for a few minutes to cool off after a Gym session , in 2 minutes a nice waiter came over with a cool drink and some fruit, all complementary... what can I say. ",5,,
Went there for high tea,cherietomkins,"My friend and I went to the Four Seasons for high tea, it was a bit disappointing as in Australia you get your savory food first but we got the sandwiches first cakes next the savory again then sweet again. The sandwiches were terrific and we has 4 types and the lovely waitress came back 3 times, then came the cakes they were very nice, but to have savory after cakes was strange. All through we could have as much coffee and tea as we wanted, but we were shocked when we were told the price as there are extra charges included on the bill and I feel that when its advertised it should be mentioned the other charges that must be payed so you know the exact price of the indulgence. Dont think I would go again because it was too expensive for what you got",5,,

Great Stay at the Four Seasons Singapore!,rafalution_2009,"Four Seasons has always been my favourite - it sets the standards in terms of service, luxury and the comfort, which of course, comes with a price.   Location:  Next to Orchard Road - ION mall is a 5 minute walk away (Orchard MRT station is within ION mall itself),   Hotel/Service: Checking in was smooth and service are within the Four Seasons standards.  The hotel is undergoing a major refurbishment of the rooms. Despite us being allocated un-refurbished room, the interiors were well-maintained and clean.

(Another) Perfect Stay at Four Seasons,RobT,"We stayed at Four Seasons on 11 and 12 November, during a stopover before flying to Bali to holiday with friends. We've stayed here in the past, and in May I submitted a review that although was 5/5, I did fault a couple of things (nothing major, just things that I felt let down a FS experience). This stay demonstrated the lengths FS goes to, to make things right, and how they listen to and value customer feedback.   The short version, the stay was faultless. If you're going to Singapore, book this hotel.   Now with that, I'll give my detailed feedback from this trip. I'll apologise for vague descriptions/partial names of staff.

They know your name, what you like, and the service level is spectacular.  The rooms are comfortable and spacious and offer everything you'd need - comfy beds, spacious bathroom, etc. The food and drinks are great too.

A separate lounge, dining and kitchenette made things very easy to stay there as a family with more than enough space and the feeling of being someone special at this hotel. We were also provided with a proper cot (i.e. not a portable one) for my son and this included baby bath lotions for him and nappies which were nicely‚Ä¶",5,,
Upgrade and fabulous service,Ragnar H,"Beautiful flower arrangements meets your eye everywhere which are renewed daily. Room , that was an upgrade, were new and even though they smelled a bit of paint still it was exquisite as was the furniture. This is Four seasons and you expect the best and that I what you get. The location is great as well.",5,,
Top Hotel at Orchard Road,JuergKaufmann,"You will get what you can expect from a 5-star hotel like Four Seasons. Perfect Services, excellent rooms, good Spa, good Restaurants, great Breakfast Buffet. Location wise I wouldn't choose a location around Orchard as the first choice because besides of shopping Orchard road isn't the place to be. And it is also not best located for business meetings. Don't get me wrong, it will take in Singapore max. 15 minutes with the taxi anyway. When it is rainy, you have to wait quite a bit for taxis there, so you better book your land transport in advance.",4,,
Excellent service,Forbish,Excellent service from the staff. Nothing was an issue. Service with a smile. Great location of the hotel near the biggest shopping mall and also metro station. Rooms are good size. Pool was great with one being at the top of the roof and the other on 3rd floor.   All in all impressed with the service and attention to detail. ,5,,
Exemplary Hotel,alusinek,"The service at this Hotel is impeccable! Every staff Member is eager to help and you can tell they love what they do by the smiles on their faces, the attention and care they give you. The best hotel I ever stayed in!",5,,
Classic Luxury Hotel in Singapore,KRDeal,"I have always had fantastic stays at this hotel in Singapore. The rooms are large and tastefully decorated (a bit more on the 'classic' side than the modern Asian decor the newest hotels tend to use), with large bathrooms and good views. The two swimming pools offer enough space that they are never too crowded, and I love the location just off Orchard, near Tanglin, rather than in the CBD. Service is excellent.",5,,
Always a Wonderful Stay,Noisette-May,Have stayed in this property for years and always happy with the experience. The friendliness and professionality of the staff make all the difference. The room is very comfortable; with the bed that helps a lot for a good night rest. The bathroom is spacey enough with great pick of amenities. The food and beverage served is another plus point. Seems impossible to find a reason to be dissatified! ,5,,
Corporate Private Lunch,LamN,"Went to a corporate presentation, where a western meal was served. It was a relatively small event (8 tables with about 70 guests). The food was surprisingly quite good for such an event - certainly above average: soup was served hot, main course very flavourful. Service was excellent: they systematically served ladies first, special requests were promptly attended to. Lightings and acoustics worked well. Great location if you‚Äôre looking for a place outside the CBD.",5,,
"Friendly staff, excellent location",Raj S,"The hotel is located just 2 minutes walking from Orchard Road hence its terrific location for anyone who is in Singapore whether tourism or business. Room was large, bath was nice, bed/mattress very comfortable for good night's sleep. Decor was old world and nice but still hotel is under renovation and rooms are being modernised. But I had no inconvenience in my room and was very happy with everything. Breakfast is just about okay, nothing special or great. Staff especially the reception, concierge and people at the gate were all excellent. Hotel definitely worth returning to.",4,,
Most amazing place,Nsrk,"We stayed here for 8 days and we loved coming back to the hotel every single day after a tiring sightseeing. The rooms are lovely , lighted and huge. I have a toddler and they had a children's menu which was wonderful. Swimming pool was great . But more than that the service was top notch. In fact we left our wallet with money while checking out and they actually took the trouble of finding it, sending pictures of it and wiring the money. I don't think you can expect more than that. Whenever we travel to Singapore even for a day we wont think of staying anywhere else.",5,,
Not impressive and worthed,KSup77,Hotel is old and I was given old room. The room is dated and One of the chair in the room was broken. I wasn't informed there is four season apps. Breakfast was average and lunch as well. Nothing special at all ,1,,
"Outstanding Service, Fantastic room & good location",Andytravel2015,"Room was very spacious, nice bathroom with tub and separate shower, very comfortable bed and excellent view. Every staff member provided exceptional service & made us feel very welcome. From Doorman, bellhop (Ravi),  front desk, dining room and tour staff were simply fantastic. Bellhop Ravi brought our luggage to the room but refused to accept tip & wanted to ensure we were satisfied with our room. Gym is nice with plenty of equipment though a bit cramped. Breakfast buffet was very extensive and superb.   I would definitely stay here again when I visit Singapore next. Our sincere gratitude to all the staff for making our stay exceptional. Thank you!",5,,

Excellent service beautiful gem of a hotel,Travelcat19,Amazing service and beautiful hotel. Guest services even went the extra mile to set up a play tent for my daughter and write her name welcoming her to the hotel on the mirror and draw a little teddybear for her. The stuffed animal Lion that was complimentary at the hotel was not available when we stayed so the hotel went the extra step and actually asked for our address and mailed it to us after our stay. This is the only hotel that we would ever stay at in Singapore.,5,,
Good Memories,Sniveler,"I am not sure how, but on a second visit, the staff remembered my name at breakfast!  Good memories I suppose, but more importantly this is one of the finest hotels in Asia. I love the pool, the breakfast and the very exceptional service from front door, to front desk to room service. And the pool is so nice I will mention it twice.  ",5,,
A true luxury stay,Matthew Y,"The Four Seasons do traditional luxury well, from service to bedding, restaurants to transport. The FS Singapore is no exception - I was greeted warmly by all the staff, my bags were whisked up to my room upon arrival and the room was always looking great with the help of housekeeping twice a day.  Highlights include the fantastic breakfast spread, being able to freshen up in the spa/gym changerooms before my late night flight and the premium taxi that they had waiting for me once I was ready for the airport. Nothing was too much trouble throughout my stay...",5,,
One of the best hotels in Singapore,yuunanase,"Four Seasons Hotel is one of the best hotels in Singapore.  Very close to Orchard Road, very few hotels has the convenience, as well as the quietness.  Not only that, but the staff were very helpful.  Concierge service does help in restaurant booking and recommendations.  Even after we have checked out, we can use their shower and lounge area for a good rest.  Only wish that Four Seasons group has a membership recognition program.",5,,
Needs immediate renovation,t1t2ny,"This property is too old and dated with worn out carpets, rooms and furniture. Air conditioning is old and could not maintain humidity. My room felt damp and smelled bad. Plumbing was noisy. The room felt like a 3-star motel. Until the property is renovated and upgraded, it  should not be a Four Seasons Property ",1,,

Superb host,MMMKl,What makes Four Seasons stand out among other luxury hotels is definitely the staff service. Extremely personalised and likeable staff.

Excellent Personalised Service,alimahar,"The check in / out process was smooth and staff was very pleasant.

Our favourite hotel but a disappointing stay,CLKPerth,"This is one of the toughest reviews I have had to write. I love the Four Seasons Singapore and have been going there for 10 years  - we never stay anywhere else in Singapore...up to now.  We recently spent 1 week at the Four Seasons in an Executive suite. Love the room, very spacious..was a little disappointed to be right next to the lifts given our repeat business but nevertheless great room. The noise of the lifts didn't bother us but our third guest was on a rollaway in the lounge and it disturbed them greatly.  What was disappointing about this trip was that there was a large conference being held at the same time of our visit. This had a major impact on services and overall ambience and enjoyment of the hotel. We have discussed all our concerns with one of the Guest‚Ä¶",4,,
The best there is in hotel management,robertandersonc,The Management Staff at the Singapore Four Seasons is the best in the business.

No one can match the level of service provided at Four Seasons Singapore!  They are simply the BEST!,5,,
Worth Every Penny!,robertjs465,The staff and services received were above and beyond expectations. The locations is fantastic! it is minutes from MRT and bus transportation services.

Superb Hotel in Singapore!,zzzyxgnuf,"Four Seasons Singapore has a high accessibility. The hotel surrounding is peaceful and quiet too, which is very important to me! There is just a walking distance to the main metro station and large shopping mall from the hotel, not more than 5 minutes. You can even walk to the Regent Singapore for drinks within 10 minutes.    Hotel facilities are a luxury. The room is spacious with a board garden view. They also use the Italian branded bath amenities - Lorenzo Villoresi!

Pampered,mariajellicoe,"The welcome at arrival at the hotel sold me. After a 13 hour flight and in the early hours of the morning, the very efficient check-in followed by an offer of a cup of tea/coffee and pastries was heart-warming. Also the chance to freshen up in the gym even though we did not take it. The concierge was extremely helpful at all times. We were surprised that staff who did not know which room we were in also knew our names. The restaurant was obliging enough to cook my husband noodles the way he wanted them. And room service was also very good. All the staff were friendly and ready with a smile.",5,,

The staff was super- efficient, always smiling and very customer-oriented. The hotel even provided me a small microwave oven in the room to heat my special pre-cooked meals.

A review overdue but still deserving for one of the best hotels in Singapore!,Zulazman28,"What can you say about the Four Seasons, Singapore. I've stayed on and off for many years (at one point for a week almost monthly for 2 years straight!) albeit it's been a while now but the Four Seasons deserves a review. Undoubtedly one of the best ""hidden secrets"" of Singapore hoteling.   Elegant, discrete, luxurious. That's my sum up of the Four Seasons, Singapore. The setting is not on the hustle and bustle of Orchid Road but just one road behind which makes all the world of difference. It's like a little ""resort in a city"" (sorry about the clique) but walking distance to everything Singapore has to offer with Orchid Road about 5 minutes away and a MRT station under Tangs the other side of the road. That will bring you anywhere in Singapore!  You walk into this marbled‚Ä¶",5,,

Exceptional in every possible way,CeylonBoy,"We had one of our best hotel experiences, ever, at the Four Seasons Singapore in August 2017. It was a first for us at a Four Seasons and we would now struggle to find comparable alternatives in other places. Each aspect of our stay was that good.  We can ditto to all the good things written by other reviewers but what deserve praise are a few small things that were presented to us during our stay.  The welcome was personal and warm. It's a nice touch to be called by your names and to be greeted in the room by tea and cakes and a personal note from the Guest Experience Manager, Ms. Amanda Chiam.

Not too much had changed over the time; the property has been well maintained throughout although some upgrading of fixtures may be necessary to make it competitive with the newer luxury hotels in this bustling city. As is expected of the Four Seasons chain, especially in an Asian city, service was impeccable - the staff took great pains and pride to know your name and make you feel welcome and comfortable.

It may not be a 5 star hotel but the service is exceptional everywhere. I believe in all my travels this hotel's service is 6 star. Check-in was efficient and our luggage was brought to our room. The concierge was helpful in making a reservation for us at a restaurant we wanted to visit. This was confirmed with a letter that contained all the necessary details for us to get there. The hotel attendants outside were equally helpful with getting taxis and ensuring we had cold bottles of water when we left the hotel. The room is grand and spacious. We were on the 13th floor.

Its location on Orchard Boulevard is ideal, both for business or for leisure and shopping. The hotel is a little dated but what we enjoy most about this is the welcome we get each time we arrive here. The wonderful thing about FS Singapore is that staff turnover is very low and you see familiar faces, from the doorman, the receptionists, the waiters in the lounge and restaurant, and they have an amazing knack of remembering names and faces. Its like going home and though there may be some minor shortcomings, they always go out of their way to help.",5,,

Just book here and you will find the best service in the world, the most elegant and flawless interiors, the greatest quality in food (oh my God, that breakfast...) the most exclusive and authentic luxury in any detail and the genuine care which will make you feel special like never before.

Top hotel,216emilygraces,"I stayed here for a recent trip, having stayed at the Grand Hyatt on two more recent trips.  I was not disappointed.  The hotel staff were very attentive, responding to requests quickly, bringing fruit and juice to guests when they were by the pool, cleaning the room very well and leaving fruit in the room every afternoon.  The staff were also very helpful when I lost my phone. I found the business centre easy to use, I could print off any documents I needed.  Room service arrived quickly when ordered.   The one thing I missed from the Grand Hyatt was yoga/pilates classes but I would still choose Four Seasons over GH.  The gym had everything I would have wanted (except Kettle Bells) and was mostly empty or very quiet when I used it.  I would definitely stay here again. Lovely‚Ä¶",5,,

My Son says it was UltraSplendidAmazing!!!,larc_lyle,"Great hotel; Great location; Great staff and services. My son and I loved the 20th floor pool.   Went twice in July and the staff remember my son's name. He even lost his phone but the staff found it and kept it for him.  There's upper floor construction but you'll only notice it because they mention it. Nothing really bad to say about it.   This is our new Go To hotel in Singapore.

Splendid!,Andrew,"I would say one of the best hotel we stayed with.  Though it didn't start well as the room wasn't available until 3:30pm but the manager ""Sarah"" has extended all effort to appease us. I would have rated lower than 5 because of this but how they handled the situation makes it a 5 star for me.  The staffs are very warm and accomodating, we also love the kiddie bathrobes they provided along with a complimentary bed and food was great with good selections. Great location as it is very close to Orchard road.",5,,
Best hotel in Singapore ,kenc4444,"My wife and I had a fantastic time at the four seasons... the main reason is the staff who were universally helpful, kind and accommodating, they did everything they could to make our stay special. We arrived very early and were lucky to be given a room after a 13.5 hour flight!! The room was spacious and clean, bed super comfy.. bathroom was top notch.. check in and out were a delight. The only critique I can suggest the hotel considers is making better use of the rooftop pool.. I went there a couple of times but it was overrun with kids, the adults only lap pool on the lower level is nice and quiet but it's in permanent shade meaning if you want to top up that tan you have to suffer the kids running about.. and that isn't the sort of environment where you really want to sip a‚Ä¶",5,,
"Great Stay, Centrally-Located",tinhau,A lovely hotel in the classic design located within walking distance of the shopping district on Orchard Road. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations but we were not disturbed by it. The staff are welcoming and helpful. We were a little disappointed with the breakfast choices and had expected freshly-squeezed juices and a better selection of hot items. The gym was well equipped and the pool was a good size. ,4,,
"Simply wonderful, special caring staff, central location",Ctmom90,"Never having been to Singapore before, we chose Four Seasons because it was close to our local friends.  What a wonderful experience on so many levels.  After many hours flying, we arrived at the hotel around 1:30am. Check in was easy (alas, no AmEx Platinum upgrade since they were full the night we arrived) and they did advise that 2 floors above us, starting at 9am, there would be construction. Yes, we heard the noise, but it wasn't an issue. Rooms were beautiful, elegant, generously sized and with great city views. Beds were super comfortable. Location was an A+.  Around the corner from Orchard Road and the huge Ion shopping center (Singapore is famous for its world-class shopping, among other things).  We could easily walk to many places as the location was very central. THE‚Ä¶",5,,
Lovely five star with easy access to Orchard shopping street,lieuprivate,I stayed at Four Seasons with my two teenage-children and we enjoyed the five star hotel very much. Hotel decoration inside and outside is lovely. Spacious room. We were well-satisfied with all room facilities. Best location. Away from traffic noise. Only 2 minutes walk to Orchard shopping street. Check-in check-out is fast and easy. Breakfast is excellent. Two nice pools. We preferred the pool for adults because the other pool had noisy children. Overall very high service. We would like to come back.,5,,
Nice hotel at shopping district,Cheongzz,"Stayed one night in Jul 2017  Excellent service as staff initiated contact on check-in timing a week before and accomodated to our earlier check-in time request. This was for a birthday celebration and it was a nice touch with the manager personally meeting us and wishing a happy birthday, with a complimentary slice of cake.  Room is spacious with a particularly large bathroom. The shower area and bath tub is separate and it comes with 2 sinks.  Breakfast has quite a good variety and quality. Service is also very good. We were allocated at a place that is further than the breakfast area and the staff offered to carry our food over to where we were seated.  The hotel is also situated at the shopping district of Singapore with good eateries and cinemas nearby as well.  Pool is‚Ä¶",4,,
Fantastic hotel,711akhilg,"Our stay at the Four Seasons began with the hotel staff contacting us twice to ask us what would make our stay more comfortable. We requested an early check-in since we were coming off an early morning red-eye and our room was ready by 9 am! As a result, we slept comfortably -- the room was very quiet and had a wonderful view of Singapore. The hotel itself is very conveniently located just off Orchard Road, so it is close to the center but on a quiet, leafy road. This is by far the best hotel that we have stayed in Singapore.",5,,
Another Great stay at 4 Seasons Singapore ,Michaelburd20,"We experienced another great stay  at Four Seasons Singapore on way home from Israel . The service from all the staff is consistent ,  great food excellent massage / Spa how many hotels have indoor air conditioned tennis courts .

Great location and wonderful hospitality,Yeji-Olivia,"I stayed there for 2 nights. Very elegant and beautiful interior and furnishing. Lovely breakfast. Good location to shop and dine on orchard road.   The hotel was under construction and my room was noisy. I talked to the front desk and they arranged a complimentary spa treatment for me which was very generous of them. I was not happy at the beginning, but they really did three best to make my stay pleasant. I also appreciated that I was able to relax at the lounge until my late night departure after check-out.",4,,
Not even close to luxury,sanjayk892,"I stayed at Four Seasons Singapore for one night. Not what I had expected from a renowned Luxury Hotel chain. I arrived on the red eye, and needed a few hours of rest before heading out for meetings. Construction noises were so loud I thought the drill was going through my head. Rooms and bathroom are really dated - the bathroom sink would fill up and take forever to drain. Returned in the evening to find that my room had not been made. Complained to front desk and spoke with the manager - he apologized profusely, and offered me a limo ride to the airport to make up; also offered a complimentary upgrade for the next time. Appreciated his sincerity and genuine apology; I would not have expected a brand like Four Seasons to be so lax on the basics. I've seen Four Points by‚Ä¶",2,,

Best hotel in Singapore,Syrigos,"The hotel is located in an IDEAL spot in Singapore, being just a 1' walk away from bustling Orchard Road, yet not ON the main road.  Therefore, it combines the proximity to Orchard, with the peace and quiet of not being directly on it.  The interior is excellent, since it is not the chaotic big hotel that is impersonal, and it has the luxury that is becoming of the Four Seasons brand.  But the best feature of this hotel is the people: I stayed there just four nights and the staff made me feel right at home!  I have stayed in many 5* properties around the world.  The Four Seasons in Singapore is at the top of my list.  10/10 -will stay there again!",5,,

My experience was to the utmost of satisfaction with credit to 2 delightful characters - Yoga (restaurant) and Nesh (concierge). These 2 are a credit to your establishment and should be rewarded with your inhouse staff applaud and recognition programs. The team outside the doors managing taxis and arrivals/departures is outstanding. The service is a reflection of your staff engagement and satisfaction. You have won me over and I will be a promoter for your brand. Thank you and looking forward to another Four Seasons experience.",5,,

Truly exemplary guest services,globetrekker88,"The Four Seasons has always been my top choice of properties whenever my husband and I travel. The facilities and accommodations are always first class and the service outstanding. As one knows, however, it is when problems arise that a company and its employees truly differentiate themselves. In a recent stay at the Four Seasons in Singapore, my husband accidentally dropped his cell phone in the taxi enroute to the airport and didn't realize it until it was too late prior to boarding our flight. We immediately called the Four Seasons and with lightening speed were able to locate the taxi company, contact our specific driver, locate the phone, have it returned to the hotel and express mail it to our next stop which happened to be the Four Seasons in Sydney.

The front office person who checked us in let us sit and relax white my kids are running around.  She followed up on a request via a note to the room with good news.

Rather than giving us solutions, the reception lady named Kyle was very rude to my friend and rudely spoke to us as nothing could be done. We thought the reason for her behaviour might be because we were not from Western countries.  The room decor was great but overall the warmth and hospitality was missing.

Its the hotels staff duty to correct the parents who do not educate their children while staying in Hotels,Joost,Hotels should do more to service the international (business)  traveller without children.

Decent Hotel - But Poor Service,austinchuksenl,"The Four Seasons Singapore is located in a relatively convenient location just off of Orchard Road. However, the service that we received at check in was unacceptable - shortly before departing on our trip, we had confirmed a nonsmoking room and twin beds, only to find that these were no longer available when we arrived on schedule. They attempted to place us in a nonsmoking room on a smoking floor - but beware that these floors still have a noticeable smell.   Overall, the hotel is average, but certainly nothing extraordinary. Most importantly, the customer service and guest rooms fell below the Four Seasons standard.",2,,
Great value,Kristina O,"The Four Seasons Singapore offers a great value for money. It has a great location, two nice pools (one is only for adults) and a very nice bar in the evening. The staff is extremly friendly and well informed: the concierge gave us excellent tips for our stay in Singapore, which made our stay with our 9 and a 13 year old boys much more valuable. Only Minus: the breakfast is offered in a room next to the Lobby with hardly any daylight. Both mornings we had to wait in line for about 10 minutes until they could offer us a table in a room which had a little bit the charme of a canteen. The atmosphere there was not nice at all, but the choice and quality of food was therefor very good. ",3,,
Great service to compliment the location,merlitamd,Great way to start our 4 week holiday with a stop in Singapore staying at Four Seasons. Best experience so far with hotel service with quality.

No detail too small,Adam B,"I am usually a tough rater of hotels, I travel a lot and know what good service looks like. This place is impeccable. To the point that the hotel manager came up and greeted me by name at breakfast. It is not just the service but the comfort and quality of the food and finishings. They are going through renovations which they manage from 9 am to 6, so I was never bothered by the ""noise"". They have a beautiful spa, pool, steam room and sauna on the 3rd floor and another pool on the 20th floor for families.It is a quick walk to Orchard and shopping and not far to Botanical Gardens took me 15 mins to walk there.",5,,
A mixed experience for a Four Seasons,Todd S,"My stay at the Four Seasons was a rather unsettling experience.   At 8 am the first morning of my stay, I was rudely awakened by the sound of drilling and hammering‚Äîso loud that it sounded as if it were occurring inside of my room itself. In light of the fact that I had not been forewarned of their ongoing renovations, I anticipated that the Four Seasons would‚Äîat the very least‚Äîoffer me a discounted rate for the remainder of my stay. After all, for a rate of over $400 USD per night, I could have easily stayed at any of the other six American Express FHR hotels located in Singapore. Yet, I was initially offered only light discounts on certain amenities (30% off laundry or 30% off already-expensive spa treatments) in exchange for my troubles.

Service was examplary at every turn. The staff at the coffee house in paricular went out of their way , offering us breakfast options in addition to the already extensive breakfast buffet menu.

The rooms are comfortable and spacious and there is a pool, jacuzzi, spa with sauna and steam rooms and massage.  There is a choice of restaurants all very good. I am a vegan and had no problem getting well fed. The staff remembered when I came down for breakfast the second day and had creative suggestions.

Not quite up to scratch,Dennis C,"Had a couple of days in Singapore on business and as the people I was meeting were staying here I opted for it too. One plus, book on line direct with the hotel, it's cheaper than every portal I use. Disappointed with the F&B offerings as there is one small bar downstairs and that is it. The cafe on the ground floor is just adequate and the breakfast was a 5 out of 10. There is a lounge on the 3rd floor for guests for meetings etc. and the iced tea is free, but you pay for the coffee. Not quite what you expect when paying over $400 a night even though it is Singapore. And don't get fooled into thinking it's on Orchard Road, it's not. The correct address is Orchard Boulevard, a quiet street that runs parallel to Orchard Road. You have to go through an unmarked, hard to find‚Ä¶",4,,

Great? I think so.,MG440,"Few hotels understand the needs of the long distance traveler as well as The Four Seasons in Singapore. As a regular guest over many years it's time to acknowledge just how good The Four Seasons is. No matter how dusty and bedraggled I am when I arrive, I'll be ready for anything within the hour. Wherever you choose to eat the menus are excellent, the service impeccable. The beds and pillows are sublime. Concierge, housekeeping, room-service, front desk - all brilliant.  Its greatest asset is its staff who are unfailingly helpful, polite and efficient. But the thing that lifts The Four Seasons out of the Very Good into the realm of Great is its ability to be consistently excellent year after year. A truly great achievement.

It is always a pleasure to stay at this hotel and the hotel is very well located not far from Orchard Road. The hotel also has excellent facilities for business. I always stay at the Four Seasons when visiting Singapore.,5,,
"Beautiful hotel, great service!",sxm10,"Stayed here 4 nights, after spending one night at Marina Bay Sands. Although the latter was beautiful and services were very good, the Four Seasons was of a much higher caliber more personalized. They treat you as if they really care about you, calling you by name each time you approach the front desk and constantly going above and beyond to make sure you're happy. In fact after I told them my daughter was sick, they offered to bring soup up to the room! The property and facilities are impeccable and beautiful, from the pools to the gym to the room. We were in an executive suite, with separate living room/dining area. They replenished our suite with fresh fruit every day. The rate included buffet breakfast, which was a huge spread with incredible variety of foods.  The only‚Ä¶",5,,
The staff make all the difference,Rifscoe,"I've stayed at this hotel many times and it's truly wonderful. The ambience and room quality is perfect and the variety of food in the breakfast buffet is excellent. It's gym, spa and pool facilities are very good and the hotel is in a very convenient location. However, it's the warm, friendly and well trained staff that make this hotel a home away from home and it's a pleasure to stay there.",5,,
Modern Singapore,zenjuris,"My family stayed nearly a week at the Four Seasons Singapore in July 2016.  The Four Seasons Hotel Singapore reminds me of modern Singapore in the following sense:  Everything works in the way that you would expect everything to work at a Four Seasons hotel; the staff is professional; the service is good; the rooms are clean and comfortable; there are extra touches here and there; but there also is a certain sterility about the place.  There are many adjectives to describe the Four Seasons Singapore.  Charming is not one of them.  We also found the food in the restaurant to be decent but not great when compared to other Four Seasons properties.  All in all, however, we did enjoy a pleasant stay.  We also were impressed when we returned to our rooms after our first day to find‚Ä¶",5,,

"Excellent Service, Great Facilities, Comfortable Room",CyrilJulien,"The moment you enter the main lobby of the hotel, you are greeted by smiles of the bell boys, hotel manager, fresh flowers and a room fragrance that makes one feel at home. I love the quality of the food from the in-room dining menu. In my stay, I ate the One Ninety Laksa thrice, pricey but I personally love it!   I love their service. The moment you call the operator to get the bell boy to attend to the luggages and get them stored, within minutes they are up at your door step.   I had an encounter with one of the service managers in the hotel, and she took the initiative to offer me to freshen up in the locker room at the spa level without having me to head back to my room.   I love how the gym facilities had all the equipments I needed. There were sufficient equipments to‚Ä¶",5,,
Another pleasant stay at Four Seasons,Sabrina C,"Stayed at FS Singapore for 4 nights in February for business.  The hotel is sort of tucked away from the main street, but still centrally located that you can reach restaurant/shopping within 5 mins walk. Just across the street you‚Äôll find an office building (Wheelock Place) which is connected to ION shopping mall via underground pass. From there you can explore the endless options of stores and food all in air-con comfort.  Service is top-notch, and on par with other FS properties I had stayed in. Buffet breakfast has good selection, albeit a bit dark as the restaurant has no windows. The only area of improvement is probably the gym. Since there was no staff stationed inside the gym, equipment was left in disarray if previous users had failed to tidy up after themselves. . .‚Ä¶",5,,

Great service,Patricia T,"Apart from the breakfast in room dining (forgotten drink and wrong order of eggs), the service at this hotel was 10/10.

Home Sweet Home,globaltraveler97,"I came to Singapore to hold a charity dinner, and I chose the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore.  This was my first experience at this property, and I was thoroughly looked-after from the moment I was welcomed at the Front Entrance to the moments of fond farewells on departing for the airport.

This active engagement from him was both assuring and impressive to us.  His reliability was so good that we were anxious when he told us that he would have to hand the reins over to the Banquet Manager, Mun Yee, and the Captain, Constance, on the wedding day.

Great location and excellent service,purplecarman,What a pleasant stay! Only few mins walk to Icon and the orchid mrt station. Great location! The hotel is a bit dated but the fantastic services offered by the hotel staff (ESP the gentlemen at the front) made the stay very nice!   My advice is make sure you request non smoking room if you don't smoke as the smells are very strong!   Also a suggestion to the hotel if they can consider not to replace the tooth brush and paste daily. I put mine in the glass after first night stay and they were gone. It's very wasteful I think. It's okay if you would place new sets in the bathroom in case guests would like to use new ones daily. ,4,,
Aging nicely and highly recommended ,Siglo,"This was a fleeting visit. I used to be a frequent guest of this hotel but have not stayed here for many years. What struck me from time of entry to time of departure was that very little has changed in terms of service, reception and the Premier Room which I occupied. Credit to owners and management for being able to maintain everything to a consistently high level.  The Premier Room is indeed extra spacious and my only regret was that my stay was too short to enjoy it. In relation to the newer hotels, the room can now be described as classic and very comfortable. With a large bathroom and separate dressing area.   ",4,,
Great Hotel,TimNitnoy,"Hotel is everything you expect from a Four Seasons property.  Reception was quick and friendly.  Room was spacious with a very nice bed. The had a adult only pool but the pool on the top floor was very nice with great views,",5,,

"Intimate, cozy hotel",Salena K,"There are some hotels in Singapore, particularly on the Orchard Road stretch, that are like Grand Central Station. Families with luggage hanging about, laden with shopping, rushing around, checking in and checking out.   The Four Seasons is a little haven - close enough to the action but just that little bit removed from the frenetic shopping. Its location seems cut off, but a 3 minute walk to Wheelock place and you are connected via the underground pass to All the major shops.  The bathroom and closet area are spacious- you won't be bumping into your partner trying to get past. Beds are comfortable and sheets dreamily soft.

Excellent stay,lilyl625,"I love it when it's located in Orchard Road yet not crowded. The staff were friendly, I was greeting by name by the door man every time I enter or exit the hotel.

Fantastic Hotel - Truly a Four Seasons' Experience,John T,"The staff was very friendly and accommodative. The room was brilliant. The buffet breakfast spread was good. Everything was just Four Seasons' quality, as you would expect.  The location was great as well. Away from the bustling shopping belt, Orchard Road but near enough to walk there; 5 minutes.  The room was clean and you feel a certain sense of luxury as you enter the room. There is the clean and expensive feel when you enter certain hotel rooms but with Four Seasons, you feel luxurious (if that make sense). Lol. And I was there for only one night. Haha. ",5,,

Also I'd like to experience how Orchard road living is like.   The flower arrangement is just so welcoming and tranquillising.  The service is impeccable as always. Staff are more kids friendly than Ritz. they always addressed the little ones when we head out and came back and took really good care of them wherever we go - restaurant, swimming pool, room or out. Apples are everywhere, kids took a bite every day and stayed away from sweet treats naturally.

At Four Seasons, its the above expectation things I enjoy, the surprises...  we've always had little goodies left on the bed, something special besides turning down the bed (a chocolate, etc).

Amazing (as always),TravellingPenguin,"We only stay at the Four Seasons when we visit Singapore. Aside from the great location and the fact that it's very quiet, it's the staff that makes it fantastic. This is by far the warmest and friendliest hotel. They strives to provide a personal touch - greeting you by name, thoughtful handwritten notes etc.  I recall on one of our first visits that we left an item behind in error and they kept it for us until we returned months later.  This time we were celebrating a birthday and were given a lovely cake and fruit. We also returned to find afternoon tea in the room with a note welcoming us back again.  We have stayed at a few Four Seasons or visit others to dine but this one is our favourite.  ",5,,
"A high standard, nice location but .....",charmary,We spent 4 nights at the Four Seasons Singapore last week and were generally very satisfied with it. The hotel is in a lovely leafy location in the north west of the city(near the elegant Orchard Road area) but as the city is not very big this was not a problem. Cab rides were relatively cheap and another advantage was the bus stop just opposite the hotel where we were able to pick up the Hop-on Hop-off buses for easy sightseeing.  The hotel is beautiful and the public areas immaculate and gorgeous with vases of orchids and oriental art on display. The room was large and generally well appointed. However the twin beds had only one bedside table between them which had only one lamp on it with an awkward switch only reachable by one person. There was more than ample room to have‚Ä¶,4,,

But the stand out was the service we received from everyone we encountered. Our daughter was made to feel so special, with a welcome message for her on our bathroom mirror, her own bathrobe and slippers and toiletries, treats and special attention from the gorgeous lady at the pool, and friendly conversations with the greeting team.

I also had a wonderfully relaxing massage at the spa on the third floor.  What really made my stay was the service, as it always is at the Four Seasons. The staff addresses you by name from the first minute and is quick to offer assistance. A hand-written note from the hotel manager waiting for you in the room.  Orchard Road shopping and dining is within walking distance, of course, and (this being Singapore!) everything else is a short drive away. Cabs were always plentiful. I would recommend‚Ä¶",5,,

But what really impressed us is the attention to details we experienced, especially to our 2 little kids.   When we entered our room, we found 2 bottles of juice, Pretzels and some cupcakes (or brownies i think, don't remember), all in kids bowls.

Exceptional family holiday - outstanding hotel and team,lilyuburns,"We spent four days and three nights in Singapore. After spending a great deal of time trying to figure out exactly where to stay (with a three year old) we decided on the Four Seasons.

From the moment we made our reservations the hotel we responsive to all of our inquiries, and upon arrival they meet every single one of our needs.  The staff - ALL OF THE STAFF were exceptional.

Singapore Luxury ,SMSCEO,You can never go wrong with the Four Seasons. We had a suite and a room interconnecting. We were met at the airport by a representative and when we arrived at the hotel we were taken directly up to the suite where checkin occurred in the room. The hotel had special treats for the kids that were personalized with their names. At every point it was just an extra step the staff took to make you feel special. Would definitely come back.  Lots of good shopping and eateries around Orchard. Great central part of the town. ,5,,
My favorite hotel,SSadique,"I love staying at the Four Seasons anywhere, but the hotel in Singapore is definitely one of my favorite places to stay in when I am there. It's nearby to Orchard Road and although a little pricey I feel at home here. The rooms are spacious, clean, and beautiful and room service is impeccable - their pancakes are so good. I know I can come back home and have a good night's rest and relax after a whole day of outing. ",5,,

Nice place to stay,pnmehta,"Stayed with wife in Singapore for four nights. Very centrally located and yet in a quieter street away from Orchard Road. Very pleasant and attentive staff and the rooms were spacious. The only jarring note was the air-conditioning either stopped cooling or was turned off around 3 to 4 AM every night. Consequently one felt warm and was woken up from sleep. Repeated attempts to re start or turn down the temperature didn't help. Also, a hotel like this needs to have docks installed for iPhone or iPads for music playback with a decent sound system and remove the antiquated DVD/CD players. Otherwise a great property and worth staying at.",4,,
Good business hotel and base for the city,wheelie07042,"Like all Four Seasons, this is a wonderfully appointed business hotel.  Rooms are lovely (mine seemed spacious) with top quality linens and towels, free bottles of water and very comfy bed.

An Outstanding and Memorable Hotel,Inspired2015,"One of the best hotels we ever stayed in for a busy city!  Great service and professionalism from the staff.  Thanks Ali for all your help!  We paid a little extra to upgrade to a one bedroom suite, but well worth it as the room was spacious, immaculately clean, and had breathtaking views of the city.  We had room service breakfast included and it was simply delicious with local, fresh fruits. The hotel is also located a short walking distance to the malls so very covenient.  We thoroughly enjoyed this luxurious stay as it went above and beyond our expectations, and would highly recommend to other travelers.",5,,
A perfect hideaway to explore Orchard road,STEWAWAY,This is a truly luxurious hotel in a great location just minutes away from Orchard road. We stayed in a suite with separate living area. This was a great choice and we made use of the excellent room service after a hectic day shopping.,5,,
"Nice Hotel,",D8618ILjorges,"It does not include breakfast, at least not in the rate I paid, for the price that I paid, Other hotels same quality and price includes this. The service is excelent but when you travel for bussiness, it is a must to have breakfast in the hotel to optimize your time.",4,,
A brand that speaks its service,muhamadsyafiqs,"Stayed for two nights during the Coldplay Singapore tour. Hotel is conveniently located at Orchard, surrounded by lush greens with walking distance to the main shopping street. We reached the hotel from Kuala Lumpur about one and half hour earlier and were immediately checked-in although it was not check-in time yet (no question asked). Friendly staff and very accommodative on numerous occassions. Hotel room was immaculately clean and tidy with twice a day turn-down service, comfortable bed and spacious bathroom with excellent amenities too. Excellent buffet spread during breakfast with coffee/tea served in flask/pot. Overall, a very pleasant stay, will definitely stay again and recommend to other travellers as well. ",5,,
Nice Business Hotel,danielarig,"Great service, attentive housekeeping staff, and plenty of connectivity for business.  I stayed a week for business--easy to get to subway and CDB and also very convenient for shopping (and USD exchange rate is good right now).  I'd stay here again in a flash unless I decided I wanted to spend more time in a different area of town.  But with great subway access at easy taxi/Grabtaxi access, you can get anywhere pretty quickly.",5,,
Above and beyond,QuickWhitTravel,"This is a stunningly beautiful hotel. As soon as you walk in, you're met with cool air and the scent of fresh flowers. We got upgraded to a gorgeous suite, which was certainly a welcome delight after some uncomfortable flights!   The gym here is absolutely one of the best I've ever seen. They had so much good quality equipment from free weights to machines to multiple cardio options. They also have several yoga mats and balls, but the best part for me was their two foam rollers. This is an inexpensive piece of equipment that is invaluable to runners, yet most hotels do not have even one. The staff even provide water and a towel at each cardio machine, and one employee working very early in the morning made a special effort to show me where more water was available in the‚Ä¶",5,,
You can't go wrong ,Evelyn E,"I love the four seasons. I have stayed at a few of their properties and have not been disappointed. This property is no different.

long stay,ukguytemp,This hotel is outstanding - the staff are second to none - they are superb and very professional - I think with doubt the best hotel in Singapore. I would not stay anywhere else.

Quite hotel in Orchard road area,Olga-and-team,"Well, generally the hotel is nice but I would say it was a bit bellow our expectations from Four seasons chain. When you stay at Four season you always feel personal attention in any little details like small presents for kids with their name on it, bathrobes of your size etc. It was not like this at all this time. I informed the hotel about age of my kids and their names before arrival but after I had to ask to change bathrobes to kids size and we didn't receive any named welcome letters my kids are used to have. If you ask for something you will definitely get it but the problem is that you always need to ask...  At my opinion the location is not the best one - it is pretty far from all main attractions and the places when you can get a nice view.  Positive points: the fitness‚Ä¶",4,,
Singapore Stay,Charles F,"This hotel is conveniently located very close to shopping malls and a MRT station. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The room attendants pays close attention to little details and the room is very clean. The bed and pillows are very comfortable.

This should not have happened with a five star hotel.",4,,
By far one of my best hotel experiences ever!,AmericanBadger,"The service at Four Seasons is what really made this hotel stand out. The staff went above and beyond expectation from the start. Waitstaff greet you by name when you come to breakfast in the morning. I had not notified the hotel of my birthday (and was traveling solo) and there was a cake, flowers, and card in my room when I returned for the day. The bed was exceptionally comfortable with the softest sheets I've experienced. The bathroom was beautiful. I would stay here or at any other Four Seasons in a heartbeat.",5,,

BFF staycation...,Blueming,"To celebrate our more than 35 years of friendship and counting, we girls decided to treat ourselves to a stay at the Four Seasons.  The experience and treatment we received was impeccable. Knowing that we were there for a special occasion, the Guest Experience dept of Four Seasons delighted us when we walked into our rooms.  There were balloons, cakes, chocolates, macaron and sandwiches and to top it off, there were framed pictures of ourselves on our holiday trips. That was special to all of us and we appreciated the warm and thoughtful gesture by Four Seasons.  Here's to more special moments at the Four Seasons Singapore. ",5,,

Not the Four Season I expected ,Nesh,"2 nights stay at the well located hotel that you have lots of expectations from. After all it's the brand that matters. But it was not to be. My wife and I were disappointed.   Once you get great experiences in the likes of Taj , Ritz etc and then getting anything less, will leave you asking for more.  Here are my goods and bads in short.   The good -  1. location 2. Room size  3. Ok breakfast for vegetarian  4. Good for non vegetarian   Not so good  1. Sleep quality - we hardly slept both nights due to ac and bed quality  2. Air con - really annoying issue in our room was that the ac would go on auto fan mode in middle of night.

Excellent service with perfect staff !!,Bau D,"When we arrived to check in, the staff is so professional and able to speak different languages. The hotel also provided gifts for the kids. All of them were so happy for that. They also provided some refreshment specially for the kids as to avoid them from being hungry. And the adults had more time to plan about their trip. They also provided free flow of drinks and cookies at the lounge. So that, at night when we were exhausted after the whole day journey, we managed to get some bites and enjoyed the cozy environment there. This is absolutely the best hotel for family with kids. I will surely visit there again if I return to Singapore. And I will surely recommend my friends about that !!!",5,,

Asian F&L Meeting,M3150RUfrankd,"Recently attended the 2017 Asian Fuels and Lubes international conference.  Having traveled from a distance over 12 Hrs in air travel, I was greeted on arrival courteously and welcomed.  The Hotel was very clean and the room was very comfortable to relax and become prepared for the meeting.  It was very convenient to have the opportunity to meet in various areas including the lobby cocktail lounge.  When asked if the hotel could accommodate a teleconference in one of the meeting areas by lowering the sound system they obliged without hesitation.  This helped us and was appreciated. In summary I would look forward to any opportunity to return to the Four Seasons Hotel.  Thank you",5,,
Four wonderful nights at the Four Seasons,AliAndalucia,"First impressions are always the best and once you hop out of your limo or, in our case, taxi from the airport, you are in for a nice surprise.  The entrance is beautiful with a huge flower display and lit candles.  Staff friendly and efficient as one would expect from a Four Seasons establishment.  Yes the rooms are looking a bit dated compared to new builds but they are extremely spacious, well maintained and the bathroom, old fashioned elegance, all marble and mirrors and soft lights.  We were very happy and comfortable there.  Breakfast was excellent with a European buffet at one end of the dining room and Asian at the other.  We chose from both to experience something different.

Definitely more than comfortable,PhP_Tokyo,"That was my first time, and I would be more than happy to come back. Purpose was business, and it is always a kind of stress to go first time when it is a 6 days stay ... But great. Dedicated service, very much gentle but efficient. Rooms and bath rooms are large enough for a long camping stay. Room service is quick and of great listening - Laundry and dinner experimented. Wifi is optimal from bedroom to meeting rooms, and there are plugs enough all around the bedroom to power 2 iPhones, 2 iPads and 2 MacBook Airs at the same time ... Two pools (3rd flood and roof) to enjoy some relaxing time after work.  The concierge is your best friend for any activity, so don't hesitate to ask ...

"Absolutely nothing to fault, a standout in SIN",mat,"Staff's attention to detail - spectacular! Remembering the names already on the 2nd day - just amazing.  Though the hotel is not one of the recent creations in Singapore - the location: perfect; rooms & cleanliness: perfect; staff: perfect; food: perfect; attitude and ambience: can't desire more! Plus the rooftop pool and its kind staff :)  There is just one negative side of it - after the stay here, every next hotel has too big shoes to fill... :)",5,,
Fabaulous hotel in a great location,Bigbaldy64,"Stayed here for 5 nights on business. Location is really good and the quality of the rooms fantastic.

Only negative is the price of food and drink, though the location gives you local options for all tastes and budgets",5,,
Good location,Twinomugisha,The hotels is situated near the major shopping mall which makes it easy to do shopping.

What happened here,Mark S,"I don't know what's happened. I am a Four Seasons Hotel devotee. Been staying in this wonderful hotel chain since the mid 90's. Recently I visited Singapore on a business trip. I booked a junior suite.  Upon entering the room, large enough to be certain, I couldn't help noticing that the furniture looked like something I'd be more likely to see in a 15 year old 3 star hotel in mainland China. That is, old and not very clean looking. I called reception to ask if they had any updated rooms and was told no. Asked if the bigger suite was any better, again no. Had I not prepaid I would have checked out immediately.   Sorry to say, if you're a business traveler or on holiday and lucky enough to be staying in a 5 star hotel I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere. The Fullerton‚Ä¶",3,,

Wonderful for Families and Children,Tonya S,"We are Americans currently living in Jakarta and travel frequently to Singapore for medical care and holidays. We recently decided to try the Four Seasons as a change from our regular hotel. There is no looking back now! My most recent stay, I brought along my 11-year-old son. The reservation specialists kept checking in with emails about my son's age, preferences, allergies, etc. Most hotels do not show concern for our children. From the moment we stepped out of our taxi, we were greeted warmly and by name. The bellman led us to reception, where again we were greeted graciously. Each person made a point of speaking to my son. Once in our room, my son was so excited to see that the housekeeping staff had written a special greeting for him on the mirror above the bathroom tub!‚Ä¶",5,,
OMG.. amazing it was,RAHUL G,"Stayed at Four Seasons Singapore with my wife and 4 yr old child and they have completely spoiled us (booked boulevard room). Customer service is paramount to them and we noticed small nitty-gritty things they were doing. I have stayed in so many hotels worldwide but this one was simply amazing. The location, staff, room, breakfast and other amenities were simply fab. Cant get over there plush rooms and celeb style bathrooms (massive). While checking out i whispered about a nice umbrella as it was raining and the guy at the reception even though he was on other call heard me and gave us a brand new umbrella to take along as a gesture. We couldn't imagine staying anywhere else other than Four Seasons.",5,,
Great Hotel and Great Staff,Chefhmd,"We enjoyed our stay the fullest. From the moment we arrived at the hotel until we left the hotel. We only went for the breakfast and this was really good. Great variety and flawless Service even during the busy morning rush.  We left after breakfast the hotel and went to the Zoo, Universal Studios, Aquarium and River Safary. That was an amazing family trip and we where flat out every evening. The Four Seasons bed led us sleep like in heaven. Love the bed and hope we have one day this bed in our home.

Standard,Steven B,"The hotel is conveniently located on the Orchard Road and has a good gym and nice swimming pool. There is a spa - I asked for a pedicure and was told the lady wasn't based on the site so they would have to call and see if she was free (which she wasn't). Given we were in Singapore and a leading hotel one would think there would be a back up. The hotel felt a old fashioned and tied. The staff were very helpful and breakfast was delicious - they make lovely healthy juices for you. At the sister hotel, The Regent, 5 mins around the corner, is the Manhattan Bar which is worth a visit",3,,
Four Great Moments,SandraN1,"Without a doubt Four Seasons has lived up to their promises and Singapore hotel is not an exception. The hotel lobby is not very large with low ceilings and dim lighting and somewhat with Egyptian feeling. The first great moment is when entering the room (we booked deluxe king and suite). The smell, the space and the marble bathroom created such a sanctuary for a good rest after a long trip. Small lyxury details, auch as L'Occitane bath amenities, Lavazza coffee, But what they really didn't overlook is the quality of the furniture and finishings. The second great moment happened the next day. I left my latop with a mouse on the coffee table and by the evening I have noticed a mousepad and a bookmark for my book left beside it. Such a great attention. The third great moment was‚Ä¶",5,,
Good service,Buttonwoodwriter,"The staff were very friendly and helpful in this upmarket hotel with big clean rooms and a comfortable bed. There is a very nice rooftop pool. But I was rather put off by being told, on arrival, that breakfast was S$54 so I avoided eating and drinking while I was there. Don't head out of the front if you want to go the restaurants/shops but wander through the passage (and a strangely deserted shopping parade) to the Hilton which opens up onto Orchard Road.",4,,
Service was excellent ,Hasit K,"The hotel is well located near Orchard Road for shopping and eating out, which is always nice between meetings. Facilities are as you would expect in any Four Seasons hotel. I would say they went the extra mind by wishing me Happy Birthday which they would have picked up from my passport and sadly I have been away many times in hotels during my Birthday and this was the first time a hotel celebrated this day with me, for which I am grateful.

Absolute excellence,VivienneSki,"My husband and I needed a break in a first class Asian hotel. We didn't know anyone who'd stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore but have stayed in other Four Seasons and had been very satisfied. So we gave this one a punt and booked for six nights. We upgraded to a spacious suite with breakfasts included. The service from start to finish was exceptional. Genuinely friendly staff. Sparkling clean and exquisite tropical flowers throughout. Let me single out Arvin who served us most mornings in the breakfast room - he was so helpful and friendly and on his day off, organised for the staff to give us a traditional Malaysian breakfast sandwich. Michael Casey at front of house couldn't have been more helpful, nor could the concierges, including Rachelle (or Rachel?), who lent us her‚Ä¶",5,,
Nice tranquil spot,kangelini,Very nice hotel with large rooms and excellent service. Very personal and helpful touch from all customer service staff...quite unique these days...

Perfect stay,Miguel S,"First i have to thank the person at front desk (sorry i forgot his name) who was extremely nice and accommodating and even gave my little son a stuffed toy lion. Our flight arrived at around 11pm so we were extremely tired and worn out. He gave us water and time to chill at the lounge right next to the front desk. Then he accompanied us to our suite (it was supposed to be a regular room but he even offered us a promotion for a suite then and there which we could not resist) and showed us all the room functions and features.

The room was immaculate with colonial touch and bed sheet, amenities, scent etc was totally as expected. The room was spacious compared to other hotel. Mattress and linen was top. The bathroom was also very spacious with 2 wash basins (yay!). The water flow was great and the bath tub was filled in with no time.

Excellent weekend break,wandrian95,"I had a weekend break during a recent grueling business trip and planned a few days to relax and recover. I could not have chosen a better place to stay, as it was exactly the remedy I needed. Every person I dealt with was professional and kind, and the room was perfectly furnished. I would happily stay again on my next visit.",5,,
Interesting experience,ulrikko,"This is my first online review but having benefitted from online researching so many times it's time for me to chip in.  I did the classic stopover from Australian to Europe with 1 night only in Singapore.  Having stayed at many Peninsulas, Mandarin Orientals and Amans I was curious for my first Four Seasons experience.  Arrival,  I had a moment of panic when the taxi driver didn't accept credit cards but the smiling Four Seasons door man said he would take care of it and simply add it to my bill. Ahh luxury. The feeling of being taken care of with a smile. Very nice.  Check in,  Not having been to this hotel before it took me a second to find the check in counter. Small detail but a host would be nice from the door to the check in counter. Again to continue the feeling of home‚Ä¶",4,,
An Amazing hotel,Nancy O,"Loved staying here for two nights - amenities are great, the bed is so soft and you sleep soundly.  Great location and the restaurant there is wonderful - great food as we had breakfast and lunch here.",5,,
A Great Family Stay,Lisa199622,My family of 4 stayed in a superior room.  It was very spacious with a fantastic bathroom.  This was our first time to Singapore and we enjoyed the location as it was close to shops and restaurants but not overrun by tourist.  The breakfast was among the best I have seen.  The staff was 100% dedicated to making sure we had an enjoyable visit in Singapore.,5,,
Great stay,Bharat,"Four seasons as always delivers the best with service and cleanses. Hotel is not old and so the decor is. Rooms are spacious. Service is great. Loved the breakfast which includes Chinese, Indian, western and Japanese choice.  They have a special gifts for kids which is really nice of the hotel staff. We have received a greeting card for our little one left in the rooms with cookies and gift. Really appreciate that. I will suggest that card and gift is good enough and parents don't want to feed anything sweet now a days to kids.   Great stay overall   ",5,,
Very Good,Lissa1502,"The rooms are big, clean and it has a nice decoration. The view is not the strongest point of the hotel, but it is not bad. The restaurant is good and with a kind service. The location is not the best one, but it is ok. It is a good hotel, but it is not the best Four Seasons I have visited. ",4,,
The Four Seasons in Singapore is everything that you would expect from a luxury hotel.,chendricks0,"I was very pleased with my stay at the Four Seasons.  The room was large and very quiet which is extremely important to me when I travel.  From the moment I checked in the hotel, used their wonderful spa for a massage and facial, breakfasted in the hotel restaurant to my crack of dawn check out, the Four Seasons staff tried to anticipate my every want and desire.  Bravo!",5,,
Thanks for all staff how take care of me,l a,"As my first time visiting Singapore I take to many time searching for perfect hotel and I find the word exceptional as a review for this hotel ..and I find it in the reception in the room and services. And exceptional service the hotel give you a handy wi fi portable that you can use Internet in any place you go around Orchard Blvd with free locale calls and Google map . I choose the premium room and it was very comfortable ..you can reach any places from the hotel like shoppin, supermarkets , restaurants, metro station around the hotel .. My best regards and thanks for all staff how take care of me",5,,
Home Away from Home ,Audrey W,"First of all, I was able to get a room for one night at $300. That's such a great price for a hotel in Orchard. Second of all, not only was the room spacious, but the bathrooms were beautiful and had a large bathtub. This king size bedroom was perfect.  Lastly, the staff were kind and assisted me to my room as I checked in. It was lovely. 10/10 for service.   The experience here overall is worth every penny. ",5,,
Did not like my rooms and the location,Cucuruchito,"We were on a large suite with view to the tennis court but we didn t ike it, it was clean and spacious and the bed was wonderful but we did not like the decor, and colors, it was kind of old style and sad.The aisles were noisy and there was desinfectante smell . Very nice reception desk. We finally moved to The Fullerton as we found the location to far away from everything we wanted to enjoy in Singapore. We liked the chinese restaurant very much.",4,,
Exceptional!,Hamad516,"Amazing hotel, great location, beautiful rooms with plenty of space, very hospitable staff and exceptional concierge services.   It was my first time in Singapore and the staff were extremely helpful to recommend things to do and gave me insights on some of the hidden gems if the city known mostly to locals.  I highly recommend it and would personally stay here again.",5,,
Anniversary Treat,Off_down_under,"We were traveling from Sydney to the UK on our Wedding Anniversary and decided to have an overnight stop in Singapore to break up the flight.  Having stayed at the Four Seasons in Sydney a number of times, it made sense to experience the Singapore Hotel.  We weren't disappointed. We were very pleased of the upgrade to a suite and the room was amazing. Very spacious and very well prepared.  They had very kindly prepared a welcome gift for us, for our Anniversary and whilst we only stayed the one night, we were made to feel like regular clients.  We will certainly stay here again on our next stop in Singapore",5,,
Best hotel around Singapore famous shopping area.,Utojo P,More like boutique hotel with excellent staffs & services. Book in advance especially during high season because rooms are limited. Walking distance to shopping area and you will feel warmth welcome inside the hotel.,5,,
As always excellent,Carl S,"Once again I had fantastic stay at the Four Seasons Singapore. I just love this hotel  The staff is superb and the rooms are great. I only wish I could stay longer.  The pool area is very nice overlooking the city, very nice areas to sit down and work",5,,
Four Seasons standards: great hotel excellent rooms,LTraveler7,"Great hotel, will be hard to add a lot of information considering all the other reviews so I added some photos from the room. Maybe one of the only disadvantages is that it is not walking distance to anything that interesting and you would need to take a car to get a bite a a hip restaurant in the city. Amenities are great with 2 pools, one adult-only and one for families on the rooftop",5,,
Excellent,Rene V,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore. The rooms are very nice, the breakfast is fantastic with a large variety of food and the location is convenient in the middle of the shopping area and a subway station nearby. But most important to mention is the extremely friendly and helpful staff!",5,,
On of a regular trip to Singapore ,Peter K,Fore Seasons Singapoore is an old fashioned Style Hotel which I like. Service is very good. Once you are a regular guest the porter is welcoming you with your room key and you don't need to go to the reception desk. That's what I call service. The rooms are big and with usual comfort. Nice big pool on the 3rd floor. If you check in the bar try the Negroni. They do it very good. ,4,,
Excellent hotel by any standards,anne c,This hotel really makes a point of making you feel at home and welcome.  The entire staff seems to memorize your name immediately. It is an ideal location for shoppers and for all else it is a short taxi ride away. There are two swimming pools to get away from the heat and an excellent spa.,5,,
The best calm and luxurious hotel in Singapore,Ï†ïÏ£º Ïù¥,"Everything is calm and luxurious. If I get a chance to stay, I will choose Four Seasons again. Almost of stay this hotel was Biz trip so I just need relax and sleep well. In this view, Four Seasons Hotel is best in my experience. The only thing bad side is location. There is nothing around hotel but Orchard Road is 10 minutes walk around.",4,,
"Compassionate, empathetic, cheerful staff with the highest level of competence in a top notch property",Parnassusfox,"As a stopover recovery from two weeks of travel in Northern Laos and Cambodia, this was exactly the respite we needed.  Beautiful room, cross-city view, high-end amenities -- all exceeding expectations.  However, it was the extra energy and professional awareness of the staff at every turn that made this extraordinary.  In addition, dinner at the JIANG-NAN CHUN restaurant within the property was outstanding with service and food quality that matches the best in Paris or London.  Take some time to just look around and appreciate the design and commitment to excellence in the lobby, the rooftop pool, the antiques and art pieces everywhere.",5,,
Great location ... Bell Boys always go beyond !,Keratine,My second stay in two months and huge kudos especially to the Bell Boys! Nothing is impossible - they remembered me and I remembered their kindness showed to me when I had sprained my leg badly on my earlier trip! ,5,,
Fantastic Hotel,Uustuner,"We stayed in this hotel 6 nights during new year with my 10 year old daughter. Room (1217) is spacious and the view was fantastic from 12th floor. Staff is very friendly. Concierge is really helpful and are like expert like a travel agency. At breakfast there are plenty of food and wide range of products. Hotel is near to Orchard road where you can find luxury brands. Taxis are at front door, they can take you wherever you like. The only down side is the bed and pillows that are very soft therefore isn't very comfortable to my liking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would like to come back again.",4,,
Impeccable service,267Debra2013,Lovely hotel in an excellent location.  We had a Boulevard room which was spacious and elegant.  Bathroom. Is huge.  Breakfast buffet was extensive and the Chinese restaurant was superb.  However the real star here is the service which is impeccable.  The staff greet you by name and go out of their way to assist.  ,5,,
the best,yasmin2004ali,"everything is awesome, the staff are kind, and the hotel is child-friendly, they literally have everything! the food is ultimately world-class, especially the one nighty restaurant, which has the best buttered chicken. do ask the concierge about anything you want, they can assist you happily and help find your way in the country.",5,,
Wonderful hotel to staying !,cingder,"In first image in Hotel service is very friendly, and always keeping smiling face and welcome visitors.   Room is clean and wider, very quiet. washroom also very large and clean. breakfast is so nice so many choices from different cuisine. Hotel location very closer to the high street, easy to walk thru. hotel is on small high hill, so walk around very comfortable with lot of trees and fresh air area. If you staying over 10 floor you can see beautiful singapore city view.",5,,
Amazing! ,veronavarros,"Great Hotel, perfect location.  This 5 star hotel is perfectly located within walking distance of high end shopping malls and 15-25 mins away from Marina Bay Sands and Sentosa.  Service is impecable, everyone is courteous and willing to help.  Very kid friendly, they make them feel welcomed with treats in the room, slippers and a little bath rope.   Breakfast has lots of things to choose from. Room Service menu is extensive and arrives in your room within 30 minutes.  Overall is an outstanding property with quality and elegance. Definitely will be going back soon. ",5,,
Outstanding,haddockSussex,"Well how to start ,it's hard on arrival we had problems with a room won't go in to detail but was sorted straight away food was excellent the staff were truly out to this world and could not do more for my family , one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in , can't recommended enough and will return as soon as possiable special thanks to Christopher , Ali  and Doris from housekeeping .",5,,
Top class ,Crawfordsburn,"This hotel is just about perfect. Our premium room was spacious and very well equipped. Staff were discrete, efficient, and friendly. The concierges could not have been more helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was excellent. Great choice at breakfast. We especially enjoyed the Chinese restaurant's signature Peking duck. Four Seasons have got it just right. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone. ",5,,
Comfortable stay with good size rooms.,Rajesh B,"Comfortable stay with good size rooms. Bathrooms are very good as well. The staff was very courteous. Would recommend the hotel for families to stay. Not on Orchard road, but only 5 min walk. The food was also good.",4,,
Luxury hospitality at its finest,Nevash,"It was my first time staying with at the Four Seasons and it was wonderful. From the time my Uber pulled up till the time I checked out, I loved the way the staff treated me. They were always smiling and ever helpful. The Hotel is not on the main Orchard road so to speak but it is only a short walk away. The rooms are really clean and well kept. The showers were great and I loved all the big mirrors they had. The hotel bar was quiet and suitable for a quick one-on-one meeting. I would definitely stay here again.",5,,
Coo,Phyo L,This hotel is quite good and it's only a short walk to the shopping area  but it's also quite scary how well the hotel runs because I once use the free toiletries and went out for half an hour and came back and got new toiletries again. ,4,,
Customer service at its best!,Daz_8,"This was our first stay at a Four Seasons hotel and what we experienced will definitely have us consider the hotel chain in future.  We had an amazing experience centered around their extremely positive approach to customer service.  Everything was possible, very flexible, and just simply made us feel at home.  Our kids absolutely loved the attention to detail that the hotel put towards making their stay enjoyable.  From a kids shampoo and bubble bath, to robes available for the kids, and even a small stand for the kids to be able to reach the basin and wash their hands, well done Four Seasons.  To top it off, the service on the rooftop pool from the pool lady attendant (who's name I cannot recall) was probably the most amazing and genuine customer service we have ever‚Ä¶",5,,
Totally Zen,Kaveh S,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights, starting on Christmas Day.  The check in and check out were quick and painless. Considering the hotel was full we hardly had to wait. The gym and two pools were quiet and again maintained to a high standard. The spa was set to 40 deg centigrade!!  For a city hotel the place was quiet and tranquil. We had two regular rooms on 9th floor. The rooms were impeccably clean. The Marbel bathrooms had a separate large shower cubicle. The breakfast spread was good enough.  I fully recommend this hotel. Would definitely return.",5,,
"First class service and outstanding staff, making each guest feel welcome and special.",Margaret V,The staff here at this hotel are exceptional from the minute you drive up to the minute you leave.

Four Seasons Singapore,chuako,"Extremely good service and good quality of food.In room dining is recommended, staff are very helpful and thoughtful. Very luxury hotel in a very good location .  Will definitely stay in Four Seasons again !",5,,
Not up to the standard,BrianGradySF415,"This is my second stay at the Four Season Singapore in about a year. Both experiences were similar. I checked in to the hotel at approximately 9 pm on December 24th.   I had booked through the AMEX Travel website, using the Fine Hotels feature and my AMEX Platinum card. First, the could not find my reservation. I was shown a reservation card with a name similar to mine, but with incorrect information.   Secondly, they did not seem to know about the AMEX Platinum program. Thirdly, and crucially, they were unable to accommodate my request for a non-smoking room.  I was speechless.  This is 2016 and they still have smoking rooms? I was informed that housekeeping had ""refreshed"" the room and that if I needed, an air purifier could be brought up.  (The manage also very nicely offered‚Ä¶",3,,
Super service and comfortability,Ivancica S,"This hotel is reslly luxourous. Hotel staff is extremly polite, helpful and friendly. They offer brilliant service. The quality of the food is also at the highest level. When travelling to Singapore, either for business or private purpose, it os really highly recommendable to stay at this hotel. There are no weak points at all.",5,,
The best hotel in Singapore,David C,"I have been staying at this hotel for many years. I moved to the Four Seasons from the Ritz Carlton Marina initially because the location is more convenient and because the construction of the Marina Bay Sands and other buildings ruined the view from the RC. I have continued to stay at the 4 Seasons many times each year for more than 10 years because of the outstanding staff and service, the excellent food, good gym and pool, nice rooms, and easy access to Orchard Road. Having tried the Mandarin Oriental, the Marina Mandarin, the Intercontinental, and the Regent, for me the Four Seasons Singapore is easily the best hotel in town.",5,,
Very big luxurious room,Vibunrith L,Luxurious hotel with huge room and bathroom within walking distance to Orchard shopping area. The room was definitely one of the best I stayed and I stayed in many plush hotels already. Though I think the mattress is overly soft and facilities is still limited.,5,,
Wonderful,Carole B,"The Four Seasons was an excellent choice from every aspect...my room was absolutely lovely and spacious which was great because my daughter in law was joining me for one night. It is just a 5 min walk to Orchard Street the main shopping street.  It has a wonderful roof top pool and you are well looked after by a lovely lady who came to warn me when a storm was on its way. I had breakfast delivered to my room which was great, the selection superb A wonderful couple of days and I would definitely recommend a stay.",5,,
Fantastic property with great location ,hm83,I stayed in Four Seasons Singapore from 22-25 Nov. Boulevard room was quite nice and spacious. Amenities in the room were very nice. Breakfast was good too. Excellent service. Orchard road is 1 minute walk. They also have internal hallway which connects to Hilton Hotel. It opens directly to Orchard road. MRT is very near.   Overall I would rate it 5/5.,5,,
An Excellent Experience,Bonita_Preacher,"This hotel is in a fabulous location - quiet but minutes from the busy Orchard Road area. The room was wonderful with a very comfortable bed and the views are great from the windows.  The breakfast catered for every possible taste with wonderful fresh fruits and juices.  Hot food catering for western and eastern tastes.  The staff were very helpful.  It was very hot and the staff were always giving you bottles of water to take with you when you left the hotel.  We ate one night in the Asian restaurant and had a very good meal.  Overall, it was a great experience.",5,,
Awesome services,Dennis S,Great atmosphere and easy to locate the hotel. Provided alot of help and service during my stay there. Allowed quite a few friends to come up and celebrate the occassion with me and assisted me in a lot of ways without ever saying NO or unable to do.,4,,
"good service, but average hardware",Ryan744,the hotel was too cold in general (environmentally unfriendly). the bed was way too soft - hard to get good sleep (felt so tired even after a night's sleep). Their staff were friendly. The location is just so so.,3,,
Excellent staff and nice location,Filip P,"Been here due to busuness activities, I was suprised by the warmth of the people working within the hotel. Rooms  are spacious and clean, and the attendants are taking care about everything. There is a pool on the 20th floor and it is very good using it during the day.The breakfast on the ground floor offers variety of fruits and different cusines like chinese,european and american. Consierges and people in fron of the hotel  are more than friendly to give you guidance about anything you want to visit. I am recomending this hotel for sure. Would be nice If I come again to stay here.",5,,
Wonderful Experience,ConeRod,"My stay at the Four Seasons was lovely. I expected no less, but I was not disappointed. The staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was comfortable and always well kept. Central location allowed for easy access to the rest of the city and option in walking distance. I would stay there again and recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,,
Great Location and Service if Aging Hotel,Nessa V,"Our family had a lovely time at the Four Seasons.  The hotel prepared surprises for my son's 2nd birthday.  The suite we had was spacious, our every need was considered.  The breakfast was looovely.  Excellent location as well -- just a block away from Ion Orchard!  We will come back for the service and the location.  However, for a luxury hotel ... the rooms feel a little old/in need of refurbishment.",4,,
there is still things improve,daydee123,"the reason why I didnt give 5 star was because I was quite disappointed with the check in process. Not even a glass of water was given to us, not to mention juice, hot towel or anything else. This is unexpected from such a luxury hotel. I was staying at other luxury hotel around the area just 3 weeks before so I can't help myself compare them.  As for others, everything was great. The location, the food, the cleanliness.  I had breakfast for 2 days. limited choice but suite my taste and my son, the picky eater.",4,,
First Class Service,KarenWoods29,"From the moment we entered the hotel we were treated as valued guests.  Check in was speedy and painless, the room was large, lovely bathroom and a very comfy bed.  The restaurant staff greeted us by name every meal time and went out of their way to adapt a meal for my husband who has a severe fish allergy (Asian cooking uses a lot of fish sauce!).  If you're looking for a central hotel with top class service, look no further than the Four Seasons.",5,,
Excellent service.,Margiefloi,"The hotel is well located near the malls and Camden Medical Center, the venue of my therapy. The room was large enough to fit a cot and a crib. The concierge helped us with recommended restaurants and a staff even helped seal our boxes filled with the things we shopped.",5,,
Great stay,philaveller,"All I was hoping for was to get the Four Seasons service which I appreciated so much. And I did get it! Nice hotel, friendly staff and good location for shopping next to Orchard Road.  Indoor Tennis is a great experience, although not that cheap.  Breakfast is elegant, many small details which make a difference.",5,,
Perfect Stay,delligill,"My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore as the first stop in a long, multi-location trip to celebrate our silver wedding. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. Lovely room, great service and a wonderful, warm and calm atmosphere. Location is also really good. Would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,,
Great place to stay while on business in Singapore,JaimeH601,"This hotel is in a great location, within walking distance of several attractions (such as Orchard street) and across the street from the stop of the hop on, hop off tour bus. The accommodations and service are what you should expect from a Four Seasons' hotel, so you should not be disappointed. Surprisingly the price per night was not that much different from other hotels, including the Orientals. The breakfast was very good, with multiple options for westerners and locals, as was the Chinese restaurant in the second floor, which was highly recommended and we enjoyed, and the bar in the first floor, which offered multiple unique cocktails as well as the usual ones. I would definitely recommend this hotel in Singapore.",4,,
A great hotel,Christophe B,Service is really excellent and rooms are big enough to feel at home - bar is indoor and outdoor which is perfect for those who smoke - food is good - location is perfect and allow to go shopping in 5 minutes by walk - highly recommended ,5,,
‚ÄúA seven star customer service‚Äù,KelvinNG11,"Our staying at the hotel has been made a very special one by each and everyone of the respective well trained and professional hotel staff members whom we have come across to deal with (the wonderful and knowledgeable concierge team, the hotel representative and driver who met us at the airport, the front desk staff member who welcomed us at the main entrance upon arriving at the hotel and guided us directly to our room where he explained to us the various benefits we were entitled for, the attentive and exceptional housekeeping and room service staff and the friendly bellmen). Very high attention to every single and small detail which contributed to the outstanding service. I would say that based on our experience this is a seven star hotel.

Needs an upgrade,Prasheem_Seebran,Rooms poor by Four Seasons standards and needs an upgrade. Service is excellent. Dinner at the restaurant was horrible. Very limited options for mains - and they didn't have our preferred option. Went for an alternative (grilled chicken) which was the worst I have ever eaten anywhere in the world. Starters and especially desserts were excellent. But can't emphasize how good the service at the hotel is! ,4,,
Always outstanding,ssas4,This hotel is consistently outstanding.  A smaller property and more of a boutique feel.  The on premise Chinese restaurant is superb.  The cocktails at the bar are fun and very good.  The bar has small bites that are well prepared.,5,,
pleasant stay,arieneflor45bautista,"me and my friends traveled to singapore last week of october to spend our long week end here, having a break at work. we chose to stay at four seasons, and our stay was amazing. the hotel experience was excellent, from the warm welcoming and very helpful staffs, to the rooms, very neat and clean, big enough to accommodate the 3 of us. plus its excellent location and delicious breakfast. what else could you ask for, four season adds a remarkable experience on our trip to SG. highly recommended",5,,
"One of the best hotels we have ever stayed, hone away from home and very personalized.",MaCrisD,"Four Seasons Singapore have a great team.

Fantastic experience once again,Paradectral A,"I spent five nights at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore. This was my second stay, and it was once again an absolutely amazing experience.  There are so many positives to the hotel:  1) Staff are generally very courteous and professional 2) The lobby is gorgeous and well maintained 3) Rooms are generously sized and well maintained (even if they are somewhat dated, this hardly shows).  4) Breakfast is divine. I'm obsessed with their rose-infused honey (a creation of Chef Yoshi, who unfortunately no longer works at the hotel). 5) The gym and spa are also very good. 6) Location is excellent.  Highly recommended - I look forward to my next stay.",5,,
bring your  parents to enjoy an unforgettable stay experience ,Prrishhan,"I have been travel to Singapore very often , this time come with my Mun.

Service better than Five Star,stevepatta,"After having the worst experience at The Four Seasons Mumbai, the Four Seasons in Singapore exceeded my expectations majorly!   The service at this hotel was absolutely 100% excellent. Personal attention and care is given to your every need.  Staff are friendly and are always ready to help.   Stayed in the Boulevard room and those rooms have Ana amazing view of the city and are very spacious.   Location wise, it's within walking distance of the famous Orchard shopping district.   I would definitely go back and stay here every time I visit Singapore.   ",5,,

Old world charm....for those who like that,VonVintlo,"Large bedrooms, very comfortable bed. Bathroom is large, dual taps, separate shower. Rooms are not completely sound proof. Hotel is not in the financial district, so a taxi ride into the CBD. Good breakfast selection, excellent service. Great gym, 25m pool.",4,,
A very relaxing stay in a quite boutique hotel,Jin Lee T,"Singapore hotel's have always been up to a very high standrad, but this hotel was really so relaxing and quite that you feel like you are the only quest which was not the case of course it was actually quite full, as I dislike crowded and noisy places and believe me Singapore has plenty of crowded places.",5,,
Fabulous few days,teddy542016,"We came to the Four Seasons Singapore as part of a stopover before heading to Bali. The hotel and the staff that work there are fabulous. From the moment you arrive you are impressed by the warm greeting from the door staff and,as the doors are opened, you are welcomed by beautiful floral displays and the gorgeous scents.  The rooms are spacious and facilities up to expectations. I see that people have criticised the breakfast offering but I fail to see why. The quality of ingredients used, the amount and variety offered at the buffet and the attentive nature of the staff made breakfast superb for us. The bar at the hotel is great and the food even better. Kids are welcome and it is a lovely place to chill out after a long day sightseeing! Singapore is an amazing place to visit‚Ä¶",5,,
"Conveniently located, great hospitality, comfy room",SNCTM,"We booked a deluxe room with breakfast but took the offer on an upgrade to a premiere queen room at special discount upon check-in. The room was spacious featuring 2 queen sized beds and the bathroom featured a separate shower area and a bathtub.  Though the furniture were dated, they have been well maintained.   The buffet line was a disappointment with a limited variety offered and we had to request for coffee for several times.  Not to mention that the concierge forgot to make a dinner reservation for us. That being said, we were still impressed with the service especially from the bell and pool staff.    As the hotel is located right off Orchard Road, I would highly recommend this hotel for those who look for convenience and comfort.  But do not expect much from breakfast‚Ä¶",4,,
Fantastic stay at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Michaelburd20,"My wife and I and Two daughters with their families just spent 10 days at the Four Seasons Singapore { daughters 3 days each] .

I can,t complement the Hotel staff and service enough the best service I have ever experienced. Food in restaurants and poolside excellent. Well done Four Seasons Singapore , we have been staying at the Shang for over 25 years whilst the Shangri-La hotel has a better outside swimming pool area it is a much busier hotel and not so personalised Special thanks to Hospitality Manager Amanda she went over and beyond her duty to  make our families feel special.

Lives up to the Four Seasons name,kzap,"TLDR. The Four Seasons Singapore lives up to its name and quality in every aspect despite the age of the property. The food and service are impeccable and you will leave with a smile.  Getting There. We took a cab from the airport and when we arrived the doorman greeted me by name which surprised me but its the little things that matter. The hotel is not huge or majestic on the outside and looks small from the lobby but feels more boutique and very well kept. You can walk to Orchard Road via the back and the Botanic Gardens are nearby so its location is ideal.  Accommodations: We were booked in Boulevard Room, and got upgraded to a Premier Room. The bathroom is spacious with 2 sinks and a tub. The room is clean and modern, everything felt right at home. The view was of Orchard‚Ä¶",5,,
Quiet 6 Star Hotel Escape ,Betel Nut,The beauty of the Four Seasons is you don't have the mass crowd and yet you are just a short stroll away from Orchard Road.

Very good ,Oliver S,"This hotel is very good. Good service, good rooms, good pools, etc. All in all a true Four Seasons.   I would have given it five stars but it needs a makeover. The decor is a bit old school and the gym needs a complete makeover.  ",4,,
"Fantastic location, but hotel could use a make-over.",Cyd S,"Hotel is a bit dated, but location is great.  We had a very large suite with an awkward layout.  The bathroom was in the entry foyer and you had to walk across the entry foyer to enter the bedroom.  Therefore, if you were getting showered and dressed, you could not have guests in the living area.  The housekeeping staff and room service was exquisite, but many of the other hotel staff had a bit of a sour attitude.  Also, there was no ""club level"" at this Four Seasons, which was a disappointment after staying at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong.",3,,

Five star experience ,Holly C,"Stayed at the Four Seasons on a business trip.  This hotel is centrally located and right across the street from a bus stop.  You can easily catch the ""hop on, hop off"" bus to see all that the city has to offer.  But what makes my rating 5 stars is the hotel staff.  From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave , the service is impeccable!  Very friendly and accommodating. Definitely recommend staying here.   ",5,,
Child Friendly Luxury Hotel,shilpy,"Rooms - We had booked a suite and the rooms were simply awesome. Huge with very comfortable beds and linen.

Coffee maker, clothes drying stand, locker was provided. To give you an idea about how child oriented they are - cookies and chocolates were available in the room when we checked in, child size slippers, bathrobe, toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo were provided in the room. A pram was also provided as we had requested for it earlier which was super convenient.  Superb Service - staff is very courteous and helpful.

One of the best in Singapore,Peter L,"After having stayed at the Four Seasons multiple times, it is always a pleasure to come back and find that the service, which is on a  constant high level has been increased and you are pleasantly surprised how this is still possible.  It is the little things such as staff remembering your name on arrival, when you step out of the taxi from the airport, or things where the guys from house keeping just provide you with a little mouse pad so that your computer mouse will work on the glass surface of your in room working desk. There are many of these little examples, which make a stay at this hotel so exceptional. Thanks to all the staff and i will definitely be back and am already looking forward to the great rooms, amenities and of course the great service.",5,,
Home away from Home...,Reem B,"I came to stay at this hotel during a work visit in October and having stayed a terrible hotel before, coming to the Four Seasons was a breath of fresh air. I cannot describe how amazing the Four Seasons Hotel is in Singapore. Just walking into this fabulous hotel, you feel welcome and right at home. From the door man that opens the car door for you to the smiling receptionist that checks you in smoothly and quickly. On entering my room, the feeling of happiness and relaxation just over comes you. The beautiful big bed, the soft pillows and the mattresses that the hotel is famous for worldwide.

Exceptional...just what you'd expect,jholetraveler,"Stayed at this property with our 2 children (8 & 10 years) and had a wonderful experience.  What I love most about the Four Seasons is how they cater to families and children in general.  The small touches make our kids feel so special.  The usual amazing beds, robes, toiletries and comforts you'd expect in any Four Seasons property.  We had a mid-morning flight into Singapore so our room was not yet ready but the staff escorted us to the spa to use the facilities to freshen up and use the pool until the room was available.  The staff were all incredible, especially the exceptional service we received at the pool.  Beautiful hotel in a great location.",5,,
Nice but not what i would call a 5 star hotel,rajsantiago,"Don't get me wrong - four seasons is a nice hotel , but when you compare this hotel to other 5 star offerings within the same price range, we just don't think its upto par. We stayed in Four seasons in January on our way back home to Sydney. When you compare this to say Shangri-la or Ritz Carlton the following issues comes to mind :  * There is no grand entry/hall way. The four seasons entry is quite small with no real ambient light - looks somewhat depressing * Breakfast is definitely not upto 5 star. When you compare this to Shangri-la or Ritz it definitely doesn't have variety or quality. Moreover, due to the lack of natural sunlight entering the breakfast area  - the place looks somewhat depressing. * We felt this hotel wasn't really accommodating to our young kids (We have‚Ä¶",3,,

Conference Venue,Anser A,"I went to attend a local conference and while the lobby and entrance to the conference hall are fairly spacious, the actual conference hall was a little disappointing given the low ceiling.

Otherwise great venue, clean and good service! ",3,,

"Nice hotel, a bit outdated.",Paola S,"Since the minute you get to Singapore's airport you get the idea of the impecable city you're getting to. Everything in the city is incredibly clean, modern, luxury and kind people.  The Four Seasons couldn't be the exception. Incredible service from the second you arrive, as expected. Luxury, orchids everywhere, beautiful lobby. But, the rooms, the common areas such as the pool are outdated. They were clean, a good size, but definitely could have a remodelation. They're The Four Seasons after all, that's what you expect, Excellence.  Foos and the bar were really nice, breakfast buffet on the other hand, was average, expected a bit more. A good experience, nice location, but next time I would rather stay at another hotel for that amount of money.",4,,

The Four Seasons Hotel is a lovely, characterful hotel with well-appointed rooms.

Very Disappointed,mims0683,"I stayed in this hotel for a night staycation with my cousin. We were both so disappointed. Four seasons hotel so old and low maintenance. During our stay our room number 1312 we were not able to sleep so well because we felt so itchy. Like some small ants or whatever biting us. It kept me awake until 4am. Even if you just stand inside the room or sit in their chair you will feel something biting you and so itchy. Aircon is not cold and i could smell dusty carpet. Pillows are so old and my neck hurts. I hope they focus more on the maintenance. This is four seasons hotel,yet we were disappointed.",1,,

Concierge people very helpful and resourceful. Location was convenient too (just 5 minutes to ION shopping mall where you can hide from the heat while exploring Orchard road.

Good and bad,Rektikano,"The good: excellent staff (universally friendly and eager to help). Decent bathroom. Truly seamless, working, non-fiddly, reliable wifi literally everywhere in the hotel. Huge desk in room for working (exec suite).  Good quality room service. 20m pool, so you can do lengths, and good gym.   The bad: room a little tired - this is not a new hotel - and not very light. There are a lot of hotels out there with floor to ceiling windows and this is not one of them. Location is so-so (if you know London, it is just off the Singapore equivalent of Oxford Street. Not everyone would think that's a classy locale).  Friendly but slightly tired spa - again, feels as if it is waiting for a facelift. ",3,,
Faded Gem,HPtraveller,"I recently travelled with my 18 year old daughter to Singapore. I have been coming to Singapore nearly every 18 months since I was a child for a getaway, and therefore I have stayed at numerous 5* hotels over the years. Four Seasons Hotel whilst in a wonderful location is still not as ideal as the Grand Hyatt. Four Seasons has lovely common areas but it's rooms are out dated and very tired looking. In need of a serious paint job and new bath mat at the very least. St Regis wins this hands down. Four Seasons buffet breakfast was very lack lustre, and the staff inconsistent  in quality and attentiveness compared to the Ritz Carlton. Four Seasons rooftop swimming pool was fabulous.

Not what you expect from Four Seasons,Grahambda,"For those of you  that frequent Four Seasons properties on a regular basis I feel you may be disappointed with this one. I would put it at a level of an average  Marriot or a Hilton. Although the service levels were very good  the property itself is ageing and in need of a major upgrade after 20+ years of operation. It just doesn't have that 4/5 star plus feel about it.   We didn't have a great initial experience after a long flight in from Africa, we were more than  ready for a 6 night stay at our ""go to"" high end hotel chain. However we were  put in a smallish lower end room overlooking a building site (not their fault of course - the building site but a heads up when booking would have been nice) nowhere near the standard we have come to expect from 4 seasons.

Nice hotel but not living up to the FS standard,Phoebe H,"The hotel is in a decently convenient location and I would say this is probably one of the top 5 star hotels in the orchard area.  The checkin was fast and the room was quite nice. Although this hotel is not the newest hotel in the world, the room was pretty good for its age and kept in a nice condition.   I think there are a few areas that require improvement in order to qualify as a true FS hotel in my perspective. Firstly, the doormen are really not that helpful, they did not offer to carry bags and did bare minimal. The housekeeping was also a bit slack, small bits of rubbish still here and there after making up the room, needs a bit more attention to detail. However the most disappointing was the pool area.

"Great location, good standard ",MrsWorldly,"Had two interconnecting rooms on the 9 th floor Facing treetops.  Be warned there is currently construction on the other side of the building so we were unable to get an upgrade as included in our booking. No compensation was offered instead  Rooms were nice bathrooms big. Mine had a leaking bidet and a slight musty smell. One night some noise woke us all in the hallway Breakfast good, loved the fresh coconuts  Pool areas there are two  Go to the 3 rd level if you don't want to get sunburned as its always in the shade Rooftop pool attendant was fabulous. Treated us like royalty  Great area soft loungers and free sunscreen lots of umbrellas  Loved to location. Luxe & great concierge service that helped with our flights and meal bookings no hesitation  ",4,,

Superb,Jon S,I don't often stay in this part of Singapore as much of my business is a bit to the west and I like to avoid staying so close to the CBD.  But I had the opportunity to stay here for three nights on a stopover from Tokyo.   Other Four Seasons hotels I've stayed at maintained a high level of excellence throughout the property.  This one is no exception.  The famous Four Seasons bed is amazing.  The room size was fine.  The room furniture very nice and the rooms were quiet.   The hotel itself is in a park like residential setting but just a few steps from bustling Orchard Road.  That makes the location superb in my estimation.  Dining choice were equally good. Room service was prompt and the food excellent.  The one time I did need help at the front desk my issue was taken care of‚Ä¶,5,,
"Not bad at all, so long as good value.",Stephen A,"Stayed for a few nights (very good sized connecting rooms) you need to do a rat run (easy) through the shopping centre and Hilton to get onto Orchard Road.  Really only used hotel as a base and if the Hilton next door was same price you should stay there for location.  Staff etc, very simile but did not do a great deal for us.  Will probably never be back as just ok, not brilliant.",3,,
Great location ,Youssef Elmaroudi,Love this place best location in town near by everything great decor super nice and professional staff we check in stood 8:30 pm took us straight to our room no time wasted to our surprise they upgrade our room to a suite without me asking cause I had my 10 year old girl with us thanks to Alicia from guest relations Room are spacious clean the breakfast at the restaurant downstairs was super good different variety of foods from different continents  Overall I am not surprised when it comes to the four seasons chain they are good at what they do ,5,,
"Not cheap, but worth it. Front desk service impeccable!",Jel86,"Not cheap, but worth it. Front desk service impeccable! Rooms are nice and large. The lounge at the gym and pool level offers fruits, coffee and tea on a free flow basis for guests. Lost my access card and it was replaced within a minute without questions asked. Fab static service upon checkin and I was escorted to my room with a smile. Got a buy 2 nights get 3 deal. Without breakfast, sg$1,200.",5,,
Fantastic experience again,bmiles,"Our second stay at the Four Seasons in the last two years and again a fantastic stay. Great room, amazing service, good food. It is expensive - particularly breakfast - but felt like we got value for money.  We stayed in an executive suite with two extra beds for our 9 and 6 year old kids. It was a really good setup for us.  Breakfast was amazing (but as per above be aware it's pricey). Service was excellent.  We really like the location - easy walk or taxi to where we wanted to go. Even tried the MRT this time - pretty easy from the stop in the ION Orchard.  Finally, a big thanks to the pool attendant up on level 20 - best service hands down (sorry don't remember your name).

Traditional and still gorgeous! Strongly recommend,AnSuTokyo,"Stayed for 6 nights during a business visit, with my wife and child. We stayed at the executive suite. All staffs were extremely nice and gentle.  20F pool for children was quiet, clean, so nice for little ones, full of toys. My most strongly recommendable pool for children. One bad point was that the elevator was too slow.",5,,
Green Hotel,pleasurers,"Very convenient in the middle of singapore. Great service and clean property. Easy access to any part of singapore and can be used for business or leisure hotel. Room is nice with good view of trees.  Good chinese restaurant inside the hotel, cozy bar and cafe area. Staffs are always attentive to guest request. Superb bell and concierge service.",5,,
Convenient,Sarath R,"I have been staying here for a long time and it's a great location in the middle of singapore even though new area as MBS has developed for the place to be and where action is, still this hotel has still commanded the top quality service. The only comment is the room decoration and system in the room are abit outdated comparing to the new hotel as St Regis which is located next door offering much better overall systems in the room. Again it cult be traded of by the service and location of the hotel itself. I hope the owner and the management will do something to improve the quality of the room.",5,,
The great place to be !!,Samir Gawarvala,With my son from USA we stayed at these hotel located right on the quiet corner of orchard road to have a quiet sleep n day time walkover  busy street of orchard road. Room service n food are top rated to our satisfaction.,5,,
Great Location!,R S,Very centralized and close to Orchard Rd but minus the heavy foot traffic.  Rooms are in good condition considering they've been there for a quite a few years without a major noticeable decor overhaul.  They did have a cleaning/oversight glitch in the shower when we arrived but they tended to it the next day and were full attentive and apologetic.  Had a very good meal at their Chinese restaurant the night we left and certainly would go back.  Nothing bad on a short stay beyond the housekeeping issue.,4,,
Great Services But Aging,clubikon,"I stayed at this nice hotel for a college commercement last year.  I would have booked a newer hotel but since the Dean and everyone were staying here, I concurred.  Now, I was initially very disappointed at the decor of the room because it reminded me that this hotel was built twenty years ago and was very old fashioned.  I did not like the aging opulence and prefer something more modern.  I have stayed in a few newer Four Seasons in different cities in China.   However, I slowly learn to appreciate the hotel because the services were just so excellent and the staff made you feel so special, yet so at home.   That is an asset of all these five stars hotels in Singapore...the excellent training of the staff and their services.  I remember running downstairs in my suit and I‚Ä¶",4,,
Quality throughout,Live T,Hooray after a long holiday was such a great change to stay here with amazing detail and quality in all areas.

Great hotel with first class service,Adam G,"Always made to feel welcome, rooms are very clean & staff tend to go over and above with services provided. they emailed me to see what i might require to make our stay more pleasent & i asked for Long Jin tea which was waiting in my room on arrival!",5,,
Great Position Great Hotel,Susie27868,I recently stayed at the Four Seasons for 6 night.  Fantastic spacious rooms with a beautiful view and the most comfortable beds and massive bathroom.  The two pool areas are fabulous. The service impeccable.. Amazing concierges and our driver Shawn was the best tour guide.  A must see is the light show at Gardens by the Bay and a walk in the botanical gardens is magical.  Overall this hotel and Singapore did not disappoint.,5,,
Great roof top pool,Mark W,"A classic hotel in Four Seasons style.  Located near shopping area and easy to public transportation.  the service and quality of the hotel is top drawer.  Very helpful staff and made my wife and daughter feel very welcome.  An excellent restaurant on the first floor.  If you are in Singapore and want to spoil yourself, it is a good place to start.",5,,
Last Stay at Four Seasons,ogbonnayaukaya,The hotel conditions and decors in the suites are great.  The staff are exceptional and they make you feel at home and always reach out to help in any way they can. Pleasant and wonderful people very time I stay at Four Seasons.,5,,
Unsurpassed quality and attention to detail,RetnaTravel,"What can I say, it's a Four Seasons!  Everyone welcomes you by name from the doormen to the concierge to the dining staff.  There are always nice little touches like fresh fruit or chocolates in the room.  The cleaning staff noticed I was using a plane ticket as my bookmark so they replaced it with a nice bookmark and a very pleasant note.  Again attention to detail.  It is conveniently located a short walk to the metro station and is right next to great shopping.  You can't go wrong.",5,,
An Excellent Hotel For A Satisfying Break,lindajunelee,"I had expected the month of June to be extremely hot and humid, and was pleasantly surprised that it was fairly mild.  Possibly a big reason is that Four Seasons Singapore is only a 'long football kick' from the Orchard underground gems of shopping, eateries and transportation, besides being in walking distances of Shopping Plazas and Hotels.  I travelled mainly alone, but met with members of the family and friends.  It was a time of gelling further with family, and friendships deepened - often over the typically Chinese hospitality over famous Singapore hawker food, or in classy restaurants.  I love Singapore.  I love Four Seasons Hotel Singapore!",5,,
Excellent Service,Alaa E,"Been there as part of honeymoon trip to Far east. Service we received was excellent and remarkable. Rooms are very clean, furniture is good as well. Staff are so polite and helpful. I consider the location a very good one as you are a walking distance from shopping area and many restaurants and cafes. ",5,,
Fantastic,Dudulicious,"Attentive staff, lovely, lovely rooms, clean, flexible and accommodating about practically everything but breakfast time. Great location, everything within walking distance. Bar service - friendly and lovely complimentary snack. After a day out, door staff make you feel like you are 'home'. If I am back in this neck of the world, I would stay here again and again.",5,,
4 nights in Singapore  16 May 2016,canberra1984,We originally booked our trip through Expedia based on the reviews on this site. It was more than we originally intended to spend but thought what the heck you only live once. To save costs we were going to share a bed with our 6 year old son to keep costs down (some hotels were charging as much as $120 SGD per night for a rollaway bed). During the booking I made the error of order twin beds instead of a king bed for the wife and I.  Within 24hrs of the booking I had a call from the hotel asking if this was correct as they could see the potential problem of my error. I immediately corrected it for a king bed and they said they would include a rollaway bed free of charge for our son. Great service straight away.   We arrived about 8pm and were welcomed with arrival drinks. My son‚Ä¶,5,,
Business and family holiday,Norine C,There is something very friendly about this hotel that I haven't seen elsewhere. Booked for 6 days with a combination of work and holiday. I ordered a birthday cake for my grandson and when we were picked up at the airport the hostess and the driver both wished him a happy birthday.  This was really nice for kids and of course was repeated on arriving at the hotel. After day one being out and about we were welcomed back using our family name - it's just that much more personal. Another grandson has an egg allergy and even when I order room service they are aware of it. Great hotel in all respects.  ,5,,
Excellent four seasons service,makMumbai,"Visited Singapore for 4 nights with my wife and teenage son and chose this hotel having stayed in the past at GRAND HYATT and FAIRMONT.It was a wise choice as FS was better than both hotels in every way. We had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 full bathrooms,it was huge with an old fashioned look,it was luxurious in every way with a comfortable bed,large toilets,competent housekeeping and good room service.Hotel was 10 minutes walk to ION orchid mall ,food at chinese restaurant was excellent,concierge was helpful, I used the gym which was well equipped and the spa which was good, the lower pool looked old and uninviting however the rooftop pool was small but with a nice setting with a good view. back facing rooms face a construction site near by but we were on a higher floor so it did‚Ä¶",5,,
Super classy hotel,Izedtravel199,"The Four Seasons hotel is second to none in the South east Asian island nation. The warm staff greeted us at the front gate and quickly checked us into our 1 bedroom suite. The beautifully decorated suite with high ceilings was a lovely place to spend the days. The two full bathrooms were more than comfortable for the three of us. On most every interaction, the staff was beyond kind and was able to fulfill any request, from late checkout to dinner reservations. In addition, the concierge was very good about helping us coordinate sight seeing tours for Singapore and other destinations that we were to visit. The restaurants at this hotel were beyond impeccable and there was a wide array of local and international food types. In all, this is an absolutely lovely hotel.",5,,
Perfect Hotel,Christine E,It starts with the perfect service you receive from every member of staff when you arrive in this hotel and it just continues from there - an absolutely fantastic place to stay.  The rooms are large and beautiful with a spacious bathroom. The public areas are stunning including the pool terrace upstairs.  There is a good gym.  The breakfast buffet is a great range of every breakfast food you can imagine.  I also had a dinner and some lunches with a conference group and the food was of a very high standard.  The thing that really stands out in this hotel is the amazingly friendly and helpful staff.  Nothing is too much trouble and you feel very well looked after throughout your stay.  Just one little example of the service - I had a novel in my room purchased at the airport‚Ä¶,5,,

Best hotel in town,Thetraveler1775,"Four Seasons Singapore does not disappoint. Very friendly and personalized service, great room and facility.

A little let down by the breakfast but otherwise excellent,WaltR,Stayed here for 4 nights as part of our RTW trip. Massive room where everything worked. Very helpful and informative staff.

The first thing I would comment on was the staff, they could not do enough and it was clear that exceptional customer service was a top priority for everyone.

Other hotels offer better traveler choices in Singapore,reston10,"I selected this hotel because of the Four Seasons' consistency and because the hotel participates in the Amex Platinum FHR program, which offers certain benefits like included breakfast, space available upgrade, early check-in/late check-out, etc.    I was pretty disappointed with my stay here.  Next time in Singapore, I'll choose a different hotel.  The FS is consistently rated in the top 10 hotels in Singapore, but its a crowded field.    This hotel is located on a tree-lined street in a residential neighborhood.  But, it is a short distance walk (a couple of blocks) from the Orchard Rd shopping area.  It's a couple of miles to the Central Business District (walkable if its not too hot).    The check-in process was a little disorganized (e.g., they took a swipe of my credit‚Ä¶",3,,
One Ninety Buffet Dinner - Expensive & Almost Seamless Service,ECFoodNTravels,"As a family, we celebrated my birthday at One Ninety at the Four Seasons Hotel on a Saturday evening.   We had to choose our main course and this was then paired with a buffet of high quality salads, charcuterie, cheeses and fruit as well as a selection of decadent, delectable desserts.   There was an asparagus promotion and one of us chose that, while the rest of us chose the very generous 200g serving of Black Angus steak, although the catch was that this particular main had a supplement of S$32/- (about ¬£16/-) per steak.  Given the occasion, and the quality of the food, we still felt it was worth it.   A nice touch was when my mum was served a decadent slice of chocolate cake for Mother's Day (it's celebrated in May in Singapore) while I was served a slice of blueberry‚Ä¶",4,,
I just don't know....,Max M,"....how to review this hotel, because everytime my expectation was exceeded, they raise the bar again the next day.  The first one was a very personalised check-in experience, as well as a very thoughtful gift for a family member who's visiting Singapore after 29 years.  Then it was a visit to the pool today, where my daughter and I were thoughtfully given drinks poolside.  Then it was finding a bookmark in my book when I returned to the room, because the staff noticed that I did not have a bookmark.  So you see, it's very difficult to review this hotel, as they keep raising the bar, and Tripadvisor's rating system only goes up to five!  I am not going to bother talk about the excellent rooms and location, as there's enough comments about them already.  I'm a hotel-hopper. I‚Ä¶",5,,
Perfect place to come,Lawriesj,This was our first visit to the Four Seasons.  It's nicely decorated inside and all the staff are friendly.  We were in the bar area for the evening.  The bar menu has a good selection of all drinks.  We will come back.  My photo is a Gin and Honey Blossom.,5,,

Can't wait to go back!,annh392,I stayed here for business and we had a training session at the hotel. The rooms are lovely with huge bathrooms. The breakfasts are incredibly delicious with a mix of great international fare.   Coffee in the hotel room is Lavazza and it was great.   The staff is warm and friendly and so accommodating.

Above expectations,steve t,The room here was very nice with a comfortable bed and nice mini bar. We did not visit the pool as it was raining but it looked fine. What is amazing here is the bar and bar service. We ate at the bar and a bartender offered to go to a Hawker stand and get me an oyster omelet (learn about it on youtube). His manager told him he could not however so the kitchen made us another local staple for free just to give us a nice authentic taste of Singapore. The service was incredible and that bartender is awesome.,5,,
Located in a quiet neighborhood where minutes away from action!,Melanie Y,"About 20 minutes taxi ride from Changi airport. Located on Orchard Blvd. just behind Orchard Road. Walking distance to many shopping malls & department stores such as Ion Mall, Wheelock Place (Marks & Spencer), Tang's, Takashimaya, & Isetan. Plenty of restaurants & food courts nearby. Easy access to subway station inside these shopping malls. Room is spacious; bathroom has a separate shower & tub. Since we had eaten at food centers most of the time, we decided to try their Chinese restaurant ""Jiang-Lan Chun"" on our last day. Food is very well presented & delicious. Exceptional service & very comfortable environment. Highly recommended!",4,,
"Great location, feel the difference",Aja,"Just a few steps to Ion Orchard where you can also take the mrt and then there is the shortcut to Orchard road via the Hilton Hotel. We stayed for 3 nights.  The staff are very helpful, provided maps and tips when asked how to go around the city by public transportation.  They also arranged our private transportation to Legoland.  It was a bit pricey but very convenient.  The hotel itself was very clean, the room is quiet and beds are very comfortable.  They don't have a big lobby where you can hang around a bit but I guess most guests are in a hurry anyway so there's really not much need for it.",5,,
A gem of a hotel in Singapore,David H,"We have stayed at this Four Seasons a couple of times and the hotel, it's staff and location (just off Orchard Road), never disappoints. The rooms are large, the service is incredible and the prices are not bad at all (there are always good deals to be had). If staying awhile in Singapore or just as a stopping off point, it's our 'go to' place. ",5,,
Perhaps the best hotel experience ever,AKR0560,"My wife and I stayed in the Four Seasons Singapore for 6 glorious nights. Our check-in experience at 2am with a fabulous young lady told us this was going to be a unique experience and we were proved completely correct. Every service experience was fabulous from housekeeping, room service, the guys outside to amazing breakfast buffet. I travel a fair bit for work and this is by far the best experience I have had and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Will definitely come back. ",5,,
A shadow of its former glory. ,alpacino21,"This used to be my favourite hotel in singapore and my ONLY hotel recommendation to my international friends.

They all had an international spirit and could understand and accommodate most requests.  Today the staff, from the person who first answers your phone call and constantly confused and have no concept of the quality expected from a four seasons brand. Today, this hotel is akin to the quality level of the Hilton to which it is attached.  The vibrant sports club on the 3 Rd floor is a ghost town. No one to even greet you behind the reception.

Four Seasons service at its best,Brian M,"I stayed at the Four Seasons recently to attend a biz conference in Singapore. From the moment of arrival, when my early check-in request was readily accepted, to the moment I got into my taxi back to Changi airport, the service at this hotel was exemplary. Of course, the Four Seasons chain is known for its service and I've experienced it before in other locations but the attention to detail and care of all those on duty at the Four Seasons in Singapore blew me away.  And while it's not customary to leave a tip for the service staff (unlike the US), I felt compelled to do so in recognition of the wonderful way in which they took care of me during my three night stay.  Beyond that, the gym and spa are very well appointed.  The food was good (not exceptional, in my opinion) but‚Ä¶",5,,

NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL,MadyMadison,"Visited Singapore for a 5 days visit and chooses this hotel for its location (not in a crowded spot in town but still easy access).

Breakfast were great with many selections of food to choose. From the hotel, we could stroll down easily to MRT and accessed orchard road at ease.

I have had better check in experiences,Erik M,"Ok, this is a 5-star hotel, so I am a bit more critical than usual, but when check-in takes over 30 minutes and check-out about 30 seconds, it gives me this odd feeling that the hotel staff would rather see me go than come. Hey, I am not weird looking, don't have standing up pink-green hair or 30 facial piercings, and brought neither an entourage of drunk, loud musicians nor my 5 dogs. Just a simple one-night business trip to Singapore.  Even though I enjoy the occasional cigarette, we booked a non-smoking room in advance. On arrival this was not available and the reception-desk staff asked us to wait.

The concierge team also arranged a private guided all day tour with our own driver, what a treat. So knowledgeable and adaptable to making changes on the fly. We loved that we were given the option to check in early rather than a room upgrade. As everyone remarked if this is an entry level rooroom what would an upgrade be? The transfers from port to hotel/hotel to airport were as promised. Meals were delicious and loads of choice for the buffet breakfast with Asian, European and American dishes.

We were looked after particularly well in reservations and check in, they made our stay beyond perfect, the rest of the staff simply carried on at that high level.  We were travelling with a sick 9 yr old and my wife was still recovering from pneumonia.  We could not have asked for better service, this alone made our trip back to London much easier.",5,,
Stay at Four seasons,Sid_Kapur,I stayed at this hotel for a few hours. The checkin was quick and staff response was good. The room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is good but they should have a half day rate especially for travellers who sometimes need a stay just for a few hours.,4,,

Room is Four Season standard, staffs friendly and efficient. It is not the best Four Season but in Singapore, I think it is one of the best hotel. Cosy and private. It is our first choice of hotel in Singapore",5,,
"Classy, Quite, and Tranquil",Clara G,"The customer service at this Four Seasons was fantastic, I can't say enough wonderful things about my experience.  The pool was fantastic, the staff was friendly and experienced in providing the utmost in customer experience.  I tend to stay between the Ritz, JW Marriott and Four Seasons for work and I can say that this was one of the top hotels I've been to in the area.",5,,
Really?? This is Four Seasons?!?,happytraveller523,"The room was pretty standard for a Four Seasons, but no wow factor. The bed was comfortable, I slept well.   What really gets my goat though was the service...I return to my room at around 3pm and it was not made. When I complained, they did send someone up who explained that makeup service was from 9am to 5pm. Having said that, there were no housekeeping trolley in the corridor that would have suggested that the hotel maid was busy in some other room on my floor. And I don't blame maid service for not knowing if my room was available for cleaning since there was no signage anywhere in the room that I could put up to request my room to be made up. The maid must have forgotten to leave the sign in the room....?  On that note, the amenities were quite sparse....for a Four Seasons‚Ä¶",2,,
Prepare to have your expectations exceeded,Aik Keong K,"We love our stay and we are looking forward to our next stay with Four Seasons. Exceptional service and great location, as said, be prepared to have your expectations exceeded. Free wifi throughout the entire hotel, one of the rare services that is a premium in other hotels.  Do not miss the breakfast at the One-ninety else there will be regrets!",5,,
"Central yet quiet, with excellent service",Gerald T,"Of all the hotels I've stayed in over the years, this has left the greatest impression on me by far. The location is central (minutes walk from Orchard Road) yet quiet, and the service is top notch. The restaurants are excellent - I prefer Jiang Nian Chun although One-Ninety is not bad too.",5,,
A quiet escape near Orchard,Ruckdee,"I will probably remember this hotel for friendly front desk staff and sumptuous breakfast service. Other than that, it is another hotel with a formal ambiance and slightly dated feel. Please don‚Äôt get me wrong. There is nothing bad at all about this place. Everything is clean and functional. It only lacks something distinctive to really impress me.   It is not a bad choice at all if your business is at Wheelock Place or ION as they are both within very short walking distance. If traveling to Singapore as a tourist or for sightseeing, I am more inclined to look at other choices.",5,,
Wonderful hotel,sorloff,"Room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Lobby is nice and so is staff. As far as location, you need to take taxis everywhere. It's not so close to the tourist sights which I guess can be good. Taxis are relatively inexpensive. The roof top pool is beautiful.",5,,
The Best Service,Bella R,"I spent 2 nights on business trip in this hotel and the room was clean and the service is second to none.

An Oasis in busy Singapore,biztravelchicago,I had four nights here between business in Sydney and Hong Kong. The service was exceptional as one might expect from a Four Seasons. But the staff impressed with special touches. The lap pool is a great feature and is on a different floor from another pool open to children. Their new Chinese restaurant is amazing.,5,,
Would have been 5* except for poor meeting facilites,MCF1,"Lovely gracious hotel with very good service the moment I stepped out of the taxi. Rooms are well appointed, especially appreciated the bathroom mirrors that allow a good view of how I look fr the back! My room attendant was very efficient and sweet; day 1 he left a note saying he'd tidied all my charger wires; day 2 he left me a spectacle cleaning cloth as he noticed my case didn't have 1. Very nice personal touch.  Would stay here again but not for big meetings.  3* rating because Ballroom chandelier was clinking constantly due to the air conditioner blowing the crystals against each other. AV had awful feedback despite manny corrective events.",3,,
Fabulous!!!!,pnewbold7,"The Singapore Regent Four Seasons Hotel exceeded every expectation we had; our expectations were high. The room, staff, concierge, restaurant were all fantastic.

Their efforts bordered on terrific.",5,,
Excellent service,Marie d,"Spent 5 days in this lovely hotel to celebrate my dad's birthday.  Staff is very helpful, room and amenities are extremely clean.  They even have a 24-hour gym!

Really Wanted to Like It,jbg2,"This hotel was recommended to us by a colleague and after reading the great reviews on Tripadvisor we thought we'd be very happy with our stay here. My first impression wasn't that great as the person who was checking us in, though very pleasant, tried to upsell us on a couple of different categories of rooms. If there were better category rooms available, a complimentary upgrade would have been classier and much appreciated. We didn't upgrade and we were very happy with our spacious deluxe room. In addition to the above, we were disappointed to return to our room on our second day to find that the room was not made up (1:30 PM). We were so hot after touring that we wanted to shower and rest before going out again. Also, our room was overlooking a construction site and at 5:00‚Ä¶",3,,

absolutely superb in every aspect,Steven DH,"From the moment they open your taxi door, you enter a different world of outstanding service and pure perfection. The smell of fresh flowers, the smile of the staff, the friendly greetings, makes you feel very welcome. As you walk in, you see a see of magnificent flower bouquets, fine art, a stunning lobby. Check in is as smooth as can be. The room was beautiful, large bathroom, with separate shower and bath, separate toilet, luxury toiletries, enough wardrobe space, ... The furniture is a not very recent but it's chic, the decoration is refined, and the rooms have high ceilings with floor to ceiling windows with great views.

"Highly recommended for superb service, good location, comfort - good for business or leisure",GRW720,"I stayed twice in March for business. Both stays were excellent.  During the last 12 months I have visited Singapore four times and have stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Shangri-La, the Conrad, Crowne Plaza (Changi airport) and the Four Seasons. For a business trip the Four Seasons is the best of the hotels by a long way.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable; the bathrooms are luxuriously large, with both a big separate shower and a lovely deep bathtub. The decor is restrained and elegant, not flashy.  The desk is a good size for working. Closet space is adequate.  I have written elsewhere about the Chinese restaurant, Jiang-Nan Chun, which in short I consider to be really excellent.   At some point in 2015 the hotel sacrificed the small area that used to serve as a business center‚Ä¶",5,,
Totally 5 Star,Carlos D,"Located in a quiet area of the city, The Four Seasons provides the traveler a restful stay in elegant surroundings with all the amenities required. The service is polite & friendly, and all staff are well-trained & professional. It is a short walk to the famous Orchard Road.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,,
Overall good,Melissa W,"Food, amenities, staff was overall good. Only problem was when I had a problem with my room, the situation was not handled with customer satisfaction in mind. I need to change room because I was placed in a smoking floor, and I ended up in a handicapped room in a non smoking floor. I requested for some sort of compensation for the hassle I need to go thru, but none was given, not even a small token of appreciation (for eg: a fruit basket, etc).",4,,
Fantastic,Gorka G,"Grear service, food, smells...they take care of everything. The location is also nice. Coffee machine and chocolate strawberries waiting for you. The bed is pretty nice, slept like a baby. The price, well you cant expect a cheap thing with all the luxuries! ",5,,
Wonderful Hotel with SO much attention to detail!,ProsserKeeton,"We stayed for 4 nights, my husband and I and our 3 year old son.  As a note we spend 40-45 days per year in luxury hotels. We checked in later in the evening, our bags having not arrived from our flight.  The staff promptly gave us ""comfy"" clothes to wear to bed.  They had a beautiful bed for our son, a stuffed panda, cookies and other snacks and beautiful toiletries for him.  The room is tops-luxurious and so comfortable.  Breakfast was so incredible-in fact, we have decided it was the best one we have ever had.  Specialized jams, cheese, smoked fish etc, then the whole Asian selections-WOW, I had the best dim sum and miso soup of my life.  On our second day we were chatting with one of the staff at breakfast and we said we were planning on visiting the zoo that day.  Later in‚Ä¶",5,,

Warm reception defines some of the qualities of the hotel,Yunus F,"The warm welcome I received over the length of my stay was second to none. The room embodied comfort and peace and in all I thoroughly enjoyed every second of my time there. The moment I entered the premises the wonderful aromatic touch infused at the lobby accentuated the finer details of the interior coupled with minimal lighting which put me at a center of a golden experience. Despite the briefness of my stay, it was worth the experience and it left me a lasting impression and that desire embedded in me to instigate a return.",5,,
Another Great Four Seasons Property,1550Burke,We arrived in Singapore at 1:00 a.m. - meet by very friendly and helpful driver who filled us in on the scoops.  We used the Four Seasons app to check in while we in the airport in Narita.  The night manager meet us upon arrival - let us know what we should upgrade to a larger suite - better package deal than what we had booked.  The stay kept getting better and better.  The suite had a spectacular view.  The breakfast buffet was incredible.  Wonderful indoor and outdoor bar - great drinks and light bites.  The concierge service provided us with great recommendations for dining off campus.  I highly recommend the Four Seasons.,5,,
2nd time visit with family,tomairways,"As per previous good experience, it was also really good stay at last week. Room is very good ambiance, good swimming pool, gym also.

Fantastic Hotel,Geoff G,"Stayed here for my Nephews wedding. What a great hotel. Reception has a nice boutique feel. Room was excellent as was bathroom. We had one of the corner rooms which looked down over Orchard Road. The gym was great - really good sauna in the men's change rooms. Pool was excellent. Didn't have room service so cannot comment, but the wedding was held at the hotel and the food and service were fantastic. Hotel is a short walk to Wisma at the top end of Orchard Rd - really handy to the MRT. All round loved the place. Will stay here next time I am in Singapore.",5,,
Excellent service,Adam G,"This was a pleasant surprise, when we checked in i asked if i could get a late checkout, as my flight was not leaving till 22.00 & surprisingly the answer was no problem you can stay at no extra charge, the staff made it a point to remember you by name which makes you feel very special even though this was the first time we stayed there, i would highly recommend the hotel to any traveler staying in Singapore.",5,,

From breakfast, arranging transportation, providing us directions around the hotel and booking a great restaurant for my wife and I to enjoy.  We have been at many Four Season hotels to use their restaurant and Spa and have always experience outstanding quality of service.  This weekend was no exception which we enjoyed.    The hotel is in a great location just of Orchard and very quiet.  We enjoyed staying here and I'm sure we will look to Four Seasons when we plan our next trip to Singapore.",4,,
best beds Ever,John S,"Arrived in Singapore ex India at 05.30 and were not only shown straight to our room but offered coffee and a light snack which was with us within minutes.  Staff throughout the hotel were delightful and service from all departments excellent.

The bed was as comfortable as we have ever experienced in over 50 years of world travel!  Greatly appreciated and hugely enjoyed after an overnight flight! We will be booking again shortly for our next stopover in Singapore.",5,,
Home away from home,Khim S,"Four seasons never let me down. I sleep better resting assure that the team will look after me after difficult meeting or bad days outside the hotel.

Four Seasons Brand - Amazing Every Time!,Cocco,"a) Everything about the hotel is wonderful.  b) Most of the staff are extremely polite and ultra-efficient. You are treated like royalty from start to finish.  c) Surroundings are so beautiful and opulent, from the grand exterior of the hotel to the stunning interiors.  d) Arranged early check-in for us at short notice and had a lovely cake and card prepared by the time we had arrived off our early flight which was reflective of the sophisticated Four Seasons brand. Did not want to leave!  Housekeeping and Room Service staff were hit and miss which is surprising and disappointing under the Four Seasons brand. Examples:  a) On one day we'd have a bath mat and on the next day we would not.  b) One Espresso mug would be replaced but the other would be replaced without the saucer!. ‚Ä¶",5,,

Amazing service but location tough if your business is near marina sands,Jen R,I had a lovely experience. The service was impeccable. Pools clear and glistening. Only drawback was the location on orchard road. Taxis can add up and be hard to get when you have to take one down to marina sands every day then back out again for dinners. It is near the public transit station in the Ion so next time I might try that. ,5,,
Perfect Service in a great location,docmiri,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons for a week with our two children and we found the service from the moment we walked in the door at midnight after a long flight to be impeccable.

Our cleaner did an amazing job and we always found our room immaculate. ""Auntie"" up at the roof top pool looked after the kids so well  Concierges were super helpful and gave us great recommendations for the kids and also for dinners - Superloco on Robertson Quay was fab.

Service Stars,BeeBeaTravel,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Four Seasons.The outside of the hotel & lobby are unassuming but the room was so impressive. Especially the large bathroom with the speakers that mean you can hear the TV even while showering. The pools were excellent and never crowded. Special mention to Alison at the Rooftop Pool. She was just so lovely bringing us glasses of iced water & guava juice. She also made sure we were wearing sunscreen and insisted we use Aloe Vera before leaving the pool. Really made us feel like we were special and cared for.   The only down side was our room was always serviced very late. Between 4.30 - 5.30pm which impacted our use of the room. But despite this small annoyance, we would definitely stay here again.",5,,

Whilst I loved MBS for it's incredible size and wow factor, the Four Seasons is where I'd book into in a heartbeat, should I pass through Singapore again.  We had a basic (entry level) room on the 6th floor, overlooking the lower pool.  I loved the rooftop pool, especially the service from the staff up there - so attentive and thoughtful.

The event went very smoothly and I must say it will not be accomplished without their assistance. Like to thank Mr Fandi Haron and Mr Ho the F&B Director. Good Job guys,5,,
"Top Class Service, Great Hotel & Good Location But Not The Best For Kids' Facilities",hippodiver,"We stayed at this hotel with our 2 young kids (7 & 3 years old).  Similar to other hotels of similar class and standards such as Mandarin Oriental Singapore and The Ritz Carlton Hong Kong, this hotel excelled in the guest service and hotel amenities. It is also conveniently located near the Orchard Road shopping area.  However, we did not think this hotel beat the other hotels in the kids' department. Other hotels either provided complimentary cookies and milk, bath toys or kids' cutlery.  One key sign of ""seal of approval"" by our kids is that they tend not to want to leave a hotel where they really enjoyed their stay. When we checked out of this hotel, my kids were indifferent.  Given the number of choices of hotel in Singapore, especially for this high price, we may not come‚Ä¶",4,,

Prime location,Foo C,It's situated in a prime location. Within walking distance to most part of the orchard road but not affected by its busy atmosphere. The room is nicely decorated. Details have been attended to. The down side is some of the facilitates e.g. gym and pool a bit old.,4,,
Excellent hotel and good location,Lottie46,"Stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed every moment of it. The room was large and comfortable with fantastic view of city. Bathroom was lovely - his and hers sinks, powerful large shower and  toiletries provided. Breakfast as fantastic with options to suit every taste. Staff were all very helpful and made us feel welcome.  The hotel is within easy walking distance of MRT station and shopping areas.and M&S should you feel homesick is 2 minutes walk away. The pool on the roof  was a welcome way to cool down after being out for the day in the hot humid heat.  W dined in the restaurant on our last night and the food did not disappoint. Special offer at the bar beforehand of a double gin and tonic in a larger than normal glass  was taken advantage of as a pre dinner drink - as alcohol‚Ä¶",5,,

Stay at Four Seasons Singapore,Tony T,"The moment we walked in, we were treated like VIPs. The nice scent in air, the prompt check-in, the luggage service and the beautiful room with a great and unobstructed view of the city and big bathroom were expected of Four Seasons. What surprised me was the doorman even knew my name the next day as we waited for a taxi. Taxis may be difficult to get during peak hours but each day we had no issue at this hotel.  The hotel may be facing Orchard Blvd but the walking access to Orchard road and the malls was just 5 minutes away. Compared to other high end hotels along Orchard road if you're seeking for quietness and serenity this is definitely the one.  The club area on the 3rd floor was available to all and an added value. Our jet lag seemed to have disappeared during our stay‚Ä¶",5,,
"Excellent service, strategic location.",pwc501,"My first stay at Four Seasons was memorable because of its excellent service. The room was clean and kept tidy round the clock. My room attendant, Leo, arranged my cluttered make up and took good care of my glasses.   The pool lounge has a nice atmosphere and a good selection of drinks at the bar.  The doorman was most helpful with directions to the locations I wanted to go to, and fortunately the hotel is strategically located within walking distance to any place of interest.",5,,
"Solid hotel, won't go wrong here",dannychew73,"What you need from a hotel is a sound, solid experience. Just right in terms of service, discreet, yet personal at the same time to make you feel special. Yet not too intrusive to a point that you get annoyed. The four seasons property is well maintained and meets expectations. I get that nice colonial feel the minute i walk into the lobby / room - for me, that's a real plus point. Even though the property has been around for some time already, the four seasons still exudes luxury and quality.",5,,

Impeccable manners at all staff levels,azn_trvlr,"I had the most fabulous weekend in Singapore, largely contributed by the wonderful experience at the Four Seasons. Staff from concierge, front desk, room service and housekeeping had all displayed impeccable manners - they have all been consistently polite, friendly yet professional, and very attentive. In particular, I would like to commend the front desk personnel who checked us in on early Sat morning (12 Dec 2015; Room 709). What she did for us - early check in and late check out - were not rocket science but the fact that she was meticulous and proactive in ensuring that our unspoken needs were met had resulted in a Fully Satisfied Customer Experience for us.

Terrific hotel and amazing staff,Kimcarp,"From the moment we arrived at the airport to see the four season's driver waiting for us to the arrival at the hotel where everyone seemed to know our name and throughout our entire stay of 5 days we had a marvelous stay at the Four Seasons.  The staff service was excellent, the room was very modern and clean, the hotel was classic Four Seasons quality, the restaurants were quite good and the location was ideal to enjoy Orchard Blvd.  When we checked in, I was not feeling real well after a long flight.  The porter heard that I was not well and ordered some special tea to be sent up.  Great attention to detail!  Can't wait to return.",5,,
Fabulous visit,Mcwuk,"Great hotel,  old fashioned,  but luxurious.   The staff are the real stars,  they were all extremely helpful and made our visit very memorable.

Lifesaver.,Andrew Y,Regularly stay in Four Seasons Singapore on business.    Missed my flight on latest stay.

Luxury Hotel,Al C,Stayed here back in April as a birthday present to my Mom. We had a large premiere room facing the city. We had to call housekeeping and ask for 2 extra beds in the living room.

Had to walk through Hilton Hotel to reach Orchard Road and shopping centers.,5,,
Simply outstanding.,Mafaz I,"Simply outstanding. It's the details that make all the difference and this is where the Four Seasons Singapore really excels. There are so many instances that we enjoyed and felt spoilt by the experience. The concierge team were outstanding in organsiing our various outings, the doorman always recognising me by name, the room attendant organsiing twisties for my cables.",5,,
Expected a lot more from a Four Seasons,Bea T,Expected a lot more from a Four Seasons Hotel. Front desk was not very pro-active in providing solution for our needs. Our room and bed were small. Our stay was not all that comfortable.  Housekeeping was inconsistent. First day was thorough and complete but the succeeding days were not.  We could hear noise from construction outside and some noise from floor above.  Breakfast food spread is very good though.,3,,
Our new favourite hotel in Singapore,Reza F,"This was our first stay at the Four Seasons which coincided with our 7th wedding anniversary. Having previously stayed at Mandarin Oriental and Intercontinental, we found the level of service in Four Seasons was more personal and the friendly hotel staff made us feel right at home. As we arrived quite early, we were offered early check-in without any additional cost. Also our room was upgraded to premier which is quite large and had very nice views of the city. Overall, my wife and I had a fantastic experience and will surely come back to Four Seasons in our next visit to Singapore.",5,,
Simply Superb,David C,"My wife and I travelled from London to Cambodia via Singapore,where we stayed for three nights at The Singapore Four Seasons Hotel.

The choice of food at breakfast and dinner was varied and superb as was the service.",5,,
Luxury in the city,Agil N,"We stayed in the Four Seasons for 2 nights whilst I was on business and my wife tagged along for shopping. The property is located only 5 minutes walk from the main Orchard Road shopping area which is ideal for shoppers. Public transport is also easily available in the area. The hotel exudes luxury. The staff provided excellent service from check in to check out. The room is good sized with all in room amenities. The bathroom comes with shower and a long bath. The bed is very comfortable. The gym is not big but has all the workstations for a good workout. The swimming pool area however, is nothing spectacular. Breakfast spread was good. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel. Overall a great stay.",5,,
Great home away from home,Abstraction,Perfect in every way.  2AM arrival picked up at airport and almost directly delivered to lovely high floor huge quiet room on corner.  Amazing view.  Super quiet every night - no traffic or noise from other rooms.  Super comfortable - great nights sleep even with jet lag.  Room service was prompt and perfect for someone planning on working.  Room set up well for working/TV/sleeping/enjoying the view.  Good air conditioning.  And one of the few hotels with a pool big enough for lap swimming and a great uncrowded workout space.  Walking distance to shopping makes for an interesting distraction.  Liked the peacefulness of the public areas as well and being able to come and go without crowds of people around.,5,,
"Pleasant place, excellent service",WashingtonTraveler21,"A classic Four Seasons hotel, with a convenient location and very nice plantings around the place.  Inviting entrance and service desk.  Excellent restaurant just off the lobby with an unusually good buffet at lunch time, which (the buffet) changes a bit every day.  They offer a nifty non-alcoholic mint and lemon summer drink that will put the spring back in your step after you've spent a few hours outside in the heat.  Rooms well appointed and very clean.  A tough driveway to get into because cars have to make a 180 degree turn from the main road,but taxis and locals seem to have mastered it.  Highly attentive staff.",5,,

Quiet and relax...,cisalpino777,I enjoyed the calm of the hotel. It is not huge and you have the impression it is only you and few other people. Large room and nice view.

Great hotel in the center of Singapore - definitely the place to stay.,Bruce B,"Great service at the hotel, beautiful room and wonderful amenities.

Comfortable with friendly and professional service,Mike B,"The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to shopping centres and tourist attractions. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed - everything works as you would expect. The room service menu is good, albeit quite expensive, as is the breakfast, which is not included in the room rate. However in my experience the memory I take away is the highly competent, helpful and friendly staff. This will now be the yardstick against which I measure standards of service in similar hotels. The gym is good, as are both swimming pools. The hotel is family and child friendly.",5,,
Meeting facilities Meals,MS123NAN,"Attended a luncheon.  First time to the hotel. Very plush.  Rich and pleasant interiors and nicely quaint.   However luncheon I attended had a set 3 course menu with wines. Was dissapointed at the quality of the food and the service.  The main course was very ordinary. And the staff were rather young, not attentive and the flow of food not timely  (some arriving and other not making everyone wait ), drinks order not taken, wine served incorrectly and to a point where one of the guests had a drink spilled on them. This side can be improved.   Am sure the rooms and the restaurants must be well rated.  ",3,,
Elegant and Quiet,JoeNarberth,"My wife and I enjoyed two nights after a cruise.  Great place to escape the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Relatively small, but with every service. Room service was up to Four Seasons standards. We will book again when we return to Singapore  ",5,,
A proper luxury  5 star hotel,Nina Jasmine So... B,"After having travelled for business, it was nice to come to a proper old-fashioned 5 star hotel. The service was exemplary and discreet from check in to check out. I do think it was worth the money we paid for the rooms.   I spent 2 nights at this hotel in connecting rooms with my sister in law, daughter and niece. The children had a lovely welcome gift of cookies and a hand made note (nice touch Four Seasons staff), The bathroom had age appropriate toweling robes - also a nice touch.   The beds were super super comfortable.  Bathroom spotless and well maintained.  The food was very very good. We didn't have a single meal that was bad.

Old fashioned five star hotel,103PritiP,"The location of the hotel is good if you want to be within walking distance of Orchard Road.

Our executive room was simply impressive it was spacious, modern, showed a lot of attention to detail and was just awesome. The 2 pools were nice places to be after long days, we had water bought out to our deck chairs as we were swimming which was a nice touch. Location could not be faulted as you were within close proximity to Orchard Road which had shops, restaurants, etc. Overall staff were super friendly and were willing to always go the extra mile to make our stay as enjoyable as‚Ä¶",5,,
"Service OK, amenities OK, price not OK",Patersoneditha,"We arrived Singapore in first week of November 2015 via Singapore Airlines. Very good airline.  We arrived at the Four Seasons Hotel past noontime and we were immediately checked-in. No hassle. The reception service was excellent. For the next five days, the room supplies were promptly replenished. The rooms are not that big. The location is good, near the Orchard Road and shopping centers. The taxi fare to Gardens by the Bay is around 11 sgd during non-peak hours and around 15 sgd during peak hours. The hotel is a bit old but continued to be renovated.  To me, the hotel is a bit pricey, meaning, for the same price, I could have stayed in a bigger room, say in Hilton.",4,,
Fantastic hotel - top of its game,Paradectral A,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore for five nights, and what a fantastic five nights they were.  This is a world-class top hotel from top to bottom:  - Location: right off Orchard Road, the hotel has an unbeatable location from the main shopping street of Singapore, with loads of shops and restaurants around.  - Hotel facilities: top notch - the lobby is beautiful, the spa and gym are very very good, and breakfast is world class.  - Room:  very spacious, clean and comfortable.

Amazingly good,rajbabyb,"We chose to stay here as I wanted to be away from the craziness of somewhere like Marina Bay Sands which felt as if i was in Las Vegas!  My wife and I travelled and wanted somewhere quiet, peaceful but still near to the shopping area. Location and ambience wise, you will not go wrong with this hotel.  As a hotel in general, it is really up there. We have been lucky to stay at some great hotels around the world and this is certainly up there. I would say it is the eptimome of what the Four Seasons stand for. The room was simple but had everything you needed and all modern amenities.

Customer service at its highest level,KinSeng,"Firstly, the hotel is located away from the busy Orchard Road but at the same time within walking distance - about 9 minutes walk to the Orchard MRT station. So it is conveniently located for guests. Check-in was easy and front desk staff is polite and nice.  Hotel room was beautiful and spacious. Most importantly, it is clean and tidy. Free of dust. There is a coffee machine which provide my daily morning coffee break. Complimentary shoe shine provided. Just put my leather shoes in the shoe bag provided and housekeeping staff will take it. You will find your shiny shoes hanging outside your room door the next morning. Another brownie point.  Gym is well equipped and clean headphone provided. Towel are soft and lemon water for a good morning run. Again, well thought for guest. ‚Ä¶",5,,

Simply superb service and fine location,Belgonzo,"What really makes this hotel is the level of service from check-in, to dining, to room service, to cleaning.   Singapore has several quality hotels, but I have rarely run into a hotel where the quality of service was so consistently strong.   The location of the hotel is very advantageous to Orchard Street, as well as the Orchard Street subway station.   If the weather is bad, it is a very short walk to the entrance to the main underground mall passageway, and access to some excellent restaurants and shopping.

Arriving at the restaurant around 945pm, I requested a table away from other diners.  To my surprise, the assistant restaurant manager declined my request worrying a bigger party will arrive 15 mins before last order while the restaurant is more than half empty.

This is almost unheard of in this class of hotel. Once at reception, I was checked in efficiently, given the key but was not offered assistant to the room, which also for a hotel of the class was not expected. The room was nice but it took some time to work out all the electronics, as I was not escorted to the room and shown how the various item function.

Wonderful Stay,Kelly t,We stayed in Four Seasons on early of October with the pool view. THe room was spacious and very comfortable. Good location. All staffs were very friendly and helpful. Good breakfast. I highly recommend Four Seasons Hotel if you plan to find a good hotel for your stay in Singapore.,5,,
Incrediblely great,GuruDhanush,GOOD but costly it seems though I will get many joy but joy is not only the thing we have to know how we consume money but choosing this hotel to stay is a best one. Food is too good to eat and you will be amazed to see this. thank you,5,,
Lived up to high expectations,99Rose,"After reading the great reviews, the Four Seasons had a lot to live up to - and it certainly did! The hotel is classically styled but well maintained. Our rooms were perfect for both adults and kids (we stayed in the executive and one bedroom suite for 7 days). They were very spacious but homely (but in a luxurious way!) and the beds were blissfully comfortable. The cleanliness was perfect and the rooms always smelt fresh (I'm very particular about this). Our one bedroom suite also had a beautiful view of the surrounding area from huge windows and a large comfortable sofa to enjoy it from (highly recommended!). The staff were outstanding, very accommodating and helpful but inobtrusive. Other thoughtful, small gestures like the fresh fruit brought everyday, and little treats for‚Ä¶",5,,
Overall excellent experience. Thanks.,Lawrence L,"Stayed four nights with my family for vacation. The room is clean and extremely quiet. Room service more than twice a day. Bedding is soft and cozy. We got perfect sleeping. Everyone is nice and friendly. During our stay SGP is suffered with Haze, the hotel provided Masks for free, very considerate.  Within 5-10mins walk to ION Orchard, where MRT station connection to the whole island. Very convenient. Taxi is always available in 5 mins.   Overall the Living and Service are perfect. Only low light is Breakfast, which could do better with that price.",5,,
Perfect Hotel - Personalised Service,Mimoras,"The Four Seasons Hotel Singapore was undoubtedly the perfect hotel to complete an amazing honeymoon. We stayed there the last 3 nights of our honeymoon after having visited two other countries before. Through a great combination of luxury and quality this hotel offered us great memorable moments of pleasure and comfort. The room was very clean, comfortable with great views to the city from the 10th floor. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a great variety of traditional and international tastes plus very tasty and fresh pastries. Not much more can be said about the level of service. Me and my wife were impressed from the way all the staff of the hotel were greeting us and their will to make our stay something unique. Of course i cannot forget the receptionist who was so‚Ä¶",5,,
Classic hotel in a great location.,karoLondon,"Although not as stylish as some four seasons I have visited, this is still a very nice hotel. The breakfast is outstanding! The location was perfect next to the best malls on orchard rd. The rooms were spacious and perfectly made daily. The general manager, Sunil Narang, who we met once at breakfast was charming! No complaints. Great vacation!",5,,
Spa NIRVANA,Sharon F,"Run, do not walk to the spa at the Four Seasons. And when you get there, request Ren. I have never had such a careful, deliberate, restorative facial and massage.  She is just so terrific.  The spa area is beautiful; go early to use the sauna (dry and wet).  Ren is wonderful and the spa experience might be one of the best I've ever had.   (I only visited to the hotel for the spa)",5,,
They could not have done more for us. ,Vicksterv09,"From the second we walked in the door right up to when we left we could not have felt more welcome. Staff knowing your name is always a very nice touch but the fact they made our kids feel so welcome was just wonderful, we were personally shown to our room and they had gone above and beyond for us. For our boys they had a little welcome hamper which hand made name cards for them with cookies, cakes, sweets and apple juice. They had kid sizes robes in the bathroom and kid sized slippers even there own toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo and shower gel. Even at breakfast they were provided with kids sized cutlery and offered cushions to make them easier to reach the table, even at the fabulous rooftop pool they provided drinks for them and pool toys.

Unbelievable service!,Andre R,"Excellent hotel! Incredible service and extremely nice people. Although not close to the bay, is close to the fashion street and near the underground which takes 10min to downtown.  Breakfast is diverse and high quality fresh fruit.  Wifi works quite well.  ",5,,
Lovely stay in celebration of our wedding anniversary,crath2013,"Had a lovely stay in celebration of our wedding anniversary - which took place in this lovely hotel years ago!  We had a couple's massage in the spa - wonderful Indonesian masseuses who really gave us superb treatments.  The breakfast was simply spectacular with a wide choice of Western, South Indian, Japanese and Chinese choices... what a great breakfast buffet!  Location  - unparalleled right behind Orchard Road.  We actually walked down to experience the evening life at the shopping centres and cinemas around Scotts Road and Orchard Road.  The suite was magnificent - with lovely views.  Such great interiors and quality of linen!  Luxury bathroom, needless to say.  Pool was nice although there did not seem to be any pool side service when we went - probably late in the day... ‚Ä¶",5,,
Excellent service,Veyette,"Just stayed at Four Seasons for the past 3 nights and enjoyed excellent and dedicated service.  Very dedicated housekeeping service team who noticed that I didn't have a bookmark for my book on bedside table, and they placed one on my book with a note to let me know. They also took out the luggage stand and put my luggage on it when it was lying on the floor.   At lobby, the concierge staff are genuinely nice and friendly. Never failed to greet you with smile and good day regardless time of the day. Please remember to put on mask if haze gets really bad or do try to stay indoor. ",5,,
Recognition  Simply amazing how well all the staff recognised us from the outset,Ted H,"Walking in the room we knew that we had chosen well. Solicitous staff used our names from the outset and the attentiveness is first class. The presentation of the decor, flowers in the foyer are signature points for the brand and are well represented in Singapore.",5,,
Good Services at a quiet corner of the busiest street in Singapore,kentkam,"The well decorated lobby and the comfortable bed do meet the expectation of a Four Seasons Hotel. The staff are all very well trained and helpful, and always with a warm smile to offer help and advice which is not something usually offered in Dingapore hotel. The hotel is at the quite alley up on a slope above busy Orchard Road and you need to take a10-15minutes walk across the open carpark to the shopping area which will be inconvenient for serious shoppers with many bags on hands. The Chinese restaurant is also a surprise for Singapore standard. The food is as good as most of the Cantonese restaurants in Hong Kong although the price is a bit high. Early booking is recommended as the restaurant will get busy with outside guests during lunch time.",4,,
1st Return visit since 1998,Melvin O,I was back in this hotel for the 1st time since 1998. I found the hotel very comfortable and not tired as I was expecting. The check in and check out experience was wonderful with the reception attendant granting a slightly later checkout time due to my conference ending a little later. The room was very largest and tastefully furnished. The only downside in the room was that the lighting was a little dim and I would have preferred to have the lights adjustable for romantic dimmer lighting and brighter lighting for working in the room. The location of this hotel is very good being only 3-4 mins walk the shopping Mecca of Orchard Road. The nearest MRT station is at ION Orchard shopping mall and is only a 5 min walk away.,4,,
Perfect Experience,robynlpa,"My husband and I stayed here in September.  We had come from the Four Seasons in Bali and had originally booked our Singapore stay at the Mandarin Oriental (which I've also reviewed).  However, we switched after one night at the MO to the Four Seasons (which was quite a bit less expensive by the way).  We were sooo glad we did.  It felt like coming home-ha!  Hotel property is traditionally decorated and beautiful.  Service was typical outstanding FS service--from the first person who greets you out of your car to the super sweet older lady who waited on us at the pool every day.  We had a city view room, which was spacious, and of course with an amazing bed and pillows.  Food at the pool area and breakfast buffet were wonderful, although very expensive (as was everything in‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful Experience!,xedaway,"Arrived early in the morning and had a very pleasant and seamless checkin experience. Travelled with 5 year old daughter and the hotel had anticipated her needs and set up a play tent in the room which she loved! The room was very spacious and elegantly furnished.   More so than anything else, it was the service from the staff that made the experience really stand out, from the staff at the front desk to the bellman to the f&b staff. I could not really complain about anything. Didn't really get to try the different outlets at the hotel although I had wanted to - didn't really have time to try out the spa but had room service and the food was good.   I would definitely stay again and would strongly recommend to anyone. The four seasons difference, does really make a huge‚Ä¶",5,,
Good!,HAZELkl,"Overall is good but pricey. The hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly. The bed and the pillow are super comfortable. But morning breakfast can be improved with much more variety choices will be great. The self make salad in lunch buffet is good. They have 2 swimming pools but no chance to use it due to tie schedule. The location is near to Orchard Road, just a short walk down to the street.",5,,
You can't go wrong at Four Seasons,Gilian G,"Unlike another really bad hotel in Singapore, we love Four Seasons.  The main problem with all hotels in Singapore are the beds are too hard. But Four Seasons is a world class hotel.  Pros:  1) Good location 2) Good front desk 3) Great rooms!  Cons:  1) Price is horribly expensive as always 2) Too much light in the mornings  4 out of 5 stars!",4,,
Great hotel and location.,NSF79,"The Four Seasons Singapore is top stuff. Rooms are spacious, beds are soft and awesome, bathrooms are large and well appointed - just what you would expect from a Four Seasons. The location of the hotel, for us, was perfect. Close enough to Orchard Rd for the wife to financially ruin you but far enough away to be out of the hustle and bustle of the main road. ",5,,
A safe bet that delivers more than the room fee,Michael T,"When arranging a very last minute room for two nights from the runway en route to Singapore from KL, only one destination came to mind. With a wife, a five and one year old, I needed a reliable base.  Despite us pushing over our normal budget, the investment was returned in bucketloads. Personal service, never too much asked, the wonderful rooms and childrens robes and toiletries in the rooms - the amazing breakfast!  If you're considering it, do it. You'll never find a relaxed, professional and discrete establishment as the FS Singapore. My wife was absolutely overjoyed with the hotel.  Oh and the bed, toiletries and bathroom were all fantastic.",5,,
Loved,atxtravelinman,"Stay at the Four Seasons Singapore this August and had a wonderful stay. After spending a long day wandering through Singapore, the relatively quiet location of the Four Seasons was greatly appreciated. Even though the hotel was in a quiet spot it was still easy walking to Orchard Road and the MRT.   Our room was beautiful and kept clean daily. Miraculously, I never encountered house keeping even once, but the room was consistently kept beautiful with even our electronics cords organized daily. The view from our room was also spectacular.   If you love the gym then you are in luck. The gym at the hotel was awesome and it was a nice bonus to sit in the dry sauna for a bit after.   My one issue was that coffee and pastries ran out very quickly in the morning and was often not‚Ä¶",5,,
Incredible!,singgirl2015,"As always, staying at The Four Seasons was amazing, but this particular stay has been the best experience we've ever had at any hotel. Service Service Service....

Nice location on Orchard with great staff,VWC_SD,"I've stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore a couple times for business.  While many (most?) hotels in the Orchard areas are nice, I prefer both the service and location of the Four Seasons.  The location is perfect ... it was easy to hail a taxi in the AM  (the hotel is just slightly outside the ERP zone), and it's a short walk to the ION mall with great shopping and food.  The staff at the Four Seasons are incredibly nice and welcoming.  Rooms are spacious, modern, and quiet.    I don't dine at the hotel often given the proximity to many great, local restaurants (and the hotel restaurants seem much more expensive than the convenience offered).  The gym is nice ... plenty of equipment available at the times I went.",5,,
Just loved it,Gluten-free Traveller,"The whole experience was great.  Lovely location, loved the VIP room with the canap√©s and though most weren't gluten free they prepared some specially for me which was a lovely and welcome touch.  The service was excellent.

Incredible Stay at Four Seasons!!,Jp M,"The Four Seasons in Singapore was the best leisure hotel experience we have ever had.

The breakfast was comprehensive and of excellent quality. We will definitely visit again when we are next in Singapore.",5,,
"Ridiculous breakfast , not to brand expectation .",skipAussieontour,"Having stayed here a number of times I must say that what has brought me here may well have lost me. Service brought me to the hotel however it may well have lost me.  This morning ,22 August , in the only breakfast venue there was an extended temporary buffet set up to cope with the crowd.  Hey this is four seasons, not a Holiday Inn. To top it off there was no real area for guests to check in to get a table and thus the staff struggled and some guests queue jumped, including me .  All in all a decidedly poor experience that saw me head down the street to the Robert Timms cafe, recommended by concierge, where I had bacon and eggs and great coffee, actually better than the hotel mechanised version of espresso .  Buck up Four seasons, the restaurant should be an experience not a‚Ä¶",2,,
"Very nice place, but not that wow",Kengkla,"Stay for 2 nights for holiday  Four Seasons Singapore has excellent location, just short walk from ION and Orchard MTR. Our stay is comfortable with great service.  The downside in my opinion is the room style looks dated, but well maintained anyways. The housekeeping may be from mainland China, so he speaks little english. Breakfast can be better. it has some variety but tasteless and never hot, dont know why.",4,,
Excellent Experience,Lisa W,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights while in Singapore for business. Even though I was traveling for business, I saw numerous families staying at the hotel too. Loved every minute of it. The staff could not have been more attentive or helpful. The room is spacious, well-appointed, comfortable and quiet - I never heard anything from any of the rooms next to me. Very comfortable bed. I only had breakfast at the hotel each day and it was always very good. A lot of choices for what to eat. I will definitely stay here again. ",5,,

Another fabulous stay,USAtravelpro,"Can't say enough about this great hotel. Certainly one of my all time, world-wide favorites. Two pools (lap for adults, roof with toys for kids). Extremely well trained and friendly staff that cater wonderfully to families with small children. When we arrived our room had the kid cot (free) already set-up, cookies and apple juice, and special kids soap in the bathroom just for our son. Location just of Orchard Rd but with a direct inside passageway to the road was perfect. My only small complaint is that the beds are a bit too soft for my liking. ",5,,

Fantastic Hotel,Amanda M,To cut a long story short we were booked in at another hotel who lost our booking.  The Four Seasons arranged for us to stay with them and when we arrived at midnight had a cool refreshing drink waiting for us.  They made us feel special and welcome.  And even apologised to us for the poor service at the other hotel.  We were upgraded to an amazing room.  The room is serviced twice daily and is in top condition.  We would recommend staying here without hesitation.  The concierge is knowledgeable and guided us well and will arrange anything you wish to attend.   The hotel is in an excellent location.,5,,

The rooms are a decent size, very clean and materials used for the bedding etc are top quality as you would expect from a the Four Seasons group. The problems start when you want the added extras ... In room water bottles cost SGD$12++, a cappuccino from room service cost SGD$15++. Basic barely useable Wifi was included in the price of the room, however, if you wanted faster internet you need to spend and extra SGD$25++ a day. Don't get me wrong, the hotel, service, decor is great, but rationalising spending so much for extras which cost you a fraction of the price once you step outside the hotel is a big ask.",3,,
Biz Travel to SGP - July 2015.,Manoj S,Choice & quality of food - both in room and restaurants was disappointing.

We had complimentary tea brought to our room on the 18th floor (great view!) and a card from Pascale, who met us in the lift and brought us to our room =) Thank you, Pascale for making us feel so at home, even before we stepped into the hotel.

A nurturing oasis,Lisa R,Loved the 4 Seasons Singapore. No complaints. They took great care of us from transportation at the airport to the concierges to a nice lounge when we checked out and we're waiting for our flight. Very luxurious. The rooms were modern and lovely. Had the buffet breakfast downstairs and it was very elegant. The bike ride they offer was very nice too. You take a ride at 5:30 am while it is still dark and the roads are empty accompanied by 2 staff members and they have bikes delivered to the hotel for you. It was a lot of fun and they couldn't have been more gracious.,5,,

The breakfast buffet had plenty of options and the food and service was excellent. Location at the top end of Orchard Road was nice and quiet but close enough to the MRT and other facilities.

Outstanding Holiday Experience,Paul H,"It's impossible to fault the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore. Friendly, welcoming, helpful staff could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable.

Top Class with Attention to Details,JDSV,"There is absolutely nothing negative that I can write about the Four Seasons Singapore. At the very early arrival time no rooms were yet available but we were escorted to a comfortable lounge with coffee and sweets while waiting. Changing rooms were also available for those wishing to change and perhaps use the pool, gym or just to freshen up after a long flight. The room was, as can expected at a Four Seasons, very comfortable and offered all necessary amenities. I must complement housekeeping for their attention to detail: a microfiber cleaner cloth placed beside my reading glasses; the charge chords for cell phone neatly folded and held together with a specially designed hook (black for white chords and white for black chords). Wifi was fast. The bathroom was large and‚Ä¶",5,,

The attention to detail was great, the room attendant noticed we had forgotten our toothpaste and gave us one as complimentary. Location is great to shops and to travel to tourist areas. Concierge very helpful and efficient with help in planning our itinerary to checking us in on our flights. Breakfast was very good too!",5,,
Great Stay,SusantoWu,"I stayed here for 2 nights and was impressed by the great service. I was told that I could only check in at 2 pm but when I arrived at 12.30 pm they let me check in. The bed was big and the bathroom was fantastic. I took my bath and went out. When I came back at about 6, I was surprised to find out that the room service came to replace my towel and tidied my room. The same thing happened the next day. There were an ironing board, iron, a safe and clothes hangers in the closet. The wifi is super fast. You need to walk for about 10 minutes to get to the MRT station. You can't get food near the hotel unless you walk to the main road. This city is surely one of the safest in the world so walking to the MRT and around alone and even late at night is nothing the be worried about. ",5,,
You get what you pay for...,Jezster,"Essentially, this is a typical hotel for business people, convention-goers (like me) and rich tourists.  If you, or your employer, are paying the very high rates of the Four Seasons Hotel, then you'll get exactly what you paid for: a large, spotlessly clean room, with all the expected facilities, and attentive staff.  I cannot really fault it in any way but, conversely, there's absolutely nothing special about the hotel that makes it stand out from the crowd.  There are two outdoor pools: one on the 20th floor with excellent views over Singapore, and another on the 3rd floor, adjacent to a well-appointed gym and a relaxing guest lounge.  There are also two tennis courts (chargeable I believe) if you fancy playing tennis in searing 32 degrees heat.  The buffet breakfast was very‚Ä¶",5,,

The arrival and check in formalities are very smooth. We were also offered an upgrade with a nominal charge, which we did not feel the need for considering we were very happy with the room we had booked.

Hope to return,linbinpin,Really enjoyed our 3 nights here. Staff friendly and helpful. Room very comfortable - wonderful shower and excellent quality toiletries. Appreciated the bowls of apples scattered around the placed. Do go down to the bar and try out the cocktails - we sat at the bar and chatted with the staff - good way to work out what to try. Very close to Orchard road and public transport. We were able to use the club facilities in the evening after 2pm checkout to have a shower before our late night flight - very welcome after a humid day sight seeing. ,5,,
Perfection,Eric D,"Just stayed in this beautiful hotel, unfortunately only for 2 nights. Upon entering the hotel, you immediately feel immersed into luxury. Very spacious lobby/reception and super friendly staff. Quick check-in and I got a very nice room on the 16th floor. Great views of the city. Super comfortable bed and finally a bathroom that fit the room; so often you have a big room and a small bathroom, but in this case the bathroom was a perfect match with the room. Separate shower (a must in my opinion for a 5 star hotel), nice bathtub and great double sink. Downstairs a very cozy bar with good drinks and bar food. The adjacent restaurant served excellent breakfast (didn't have dinner there). On the 3rd floor a nice Spa and sports complex with it's own pool. Besides the pool on the roof!‚Ä¶",5,,
hidden jewel,Ion I,"As frequent traveller to Singapore it took me time to give a chance to the FourSeasons. Being a (very) little more off-centered then other 4-5* chains I was regularly, it offers the wonderful charm of feeling hardly accessible, say slightly hidden. This means calm and serenity above all and the personalized service make the overall experience very hard to match. The rooms and bathroom are as always top class. The roof top pools perfect for a quick break.",5,,

An average Four Seasons (So pretty good!),Simon R,"I've high expectations for a Four Seasons hotel and have stayed at many so that gives some context for the 4/5.  This is a little more corporate than my favourite 5/5 hotels, but nonetheless this hotel still has some nice touches (like bowls of apples on each floor) that you tend to notice. For the positives: - Great beds and bathrooms - Free internet (at last!) - but only 2 devices (I know - but I travel with a laptop, iphone and ipad) - Good fitness facilities, including a short but welcome lap pool - Excellent breakfast  Where I felt the hotel was a bit corporate / sterile was really in the common areas and the decor or my bedroom. Neither the bar and dining room were particularly nice places to hang out in, just very functional. And the bedroom had few luxury design‚Ä¶",4,,
Excellent choice in the Orchard Area,Softlanding,"Although on the fringe of Orchard Road, I like the location, as it just feels less frenetic, without being far. The Hotel itself is smaller than the norm in Singapore, which makes it a bit cozy. The service is excellent, the rooms spacious and well appointed and the tariff is not unreasonable. The dinning options are a bit limited but then it is a short walk to a plethora of choice in the Orchard Road vicinity. I like it! ",5,,
Luxury and comfort in the heart of Singapore,AngelinaAustralia,"This was our second visit to Four Seasons in Singapore and we were once again enchanted by its calm, welcoming atmosphere, the charming staff and real comfort of the room. From the luxuriant flowers in the lobby, the utterly cloud-like bed and thoughtful room extras (tea and coffee facilities, an iron) to its wonderful breakfast selection, we could not have been happier. It is also very conveniently located to walk to all the shopping one could want and a short (and very cheap) cab ride to the Marina Bay or river areas. We recently stayed at Four Seasons in Sydney, also very nice, but Singapore is definitely in a class of its own.",5,,
Great experience !!,Sharon K,"Stayed between 5/8 thru 5/14---Had an incredible time in Singapore and a beautiful stay at the four seasons!

We received great advice from the front desk and the concierge regarding dining and shopping. The bar's ambience was wonderful and we had a great time.

Restrained Elegance,ruby_girl_10,"Have just returned from 5 days in Singapore with my partner and 11 year old daughter.

Loved the flowers. We upgraded to a suite and breakfast was included and as it had been quoted at S$55 per person the upgrade at A$150 /day was a good deal. The suite was large, had a separate 'powder room,' the bed for our daughter was big and comfortable and the whole room was dark and quiet at night.  We were there to celebrate my partner's‚Ä¶",5,,

Alison is very helpful and even served us Peach tea and water. We spent the whole morning there and when we were about to leave, she pass us plastic bags to put in our wet items.

Only a five-minute walk to an extremely convenient subway line, and very close to great shopping, etc. while being removed by one quiet block from all of the noise and congestion.  Great location.  One thing for which I was very grateful was the use of their lovely spa facilities for showering and changing purposes hours after I had checked out.  Although my departure flight was not until 9:30 pm, I was able to enjoy the full day exploring Singapore before returning to the hotel to freshen up before going to the airport.  Much appreciated.  Highly recommended hotel.",5,,
A new season needed !,skipAussieontour,"I switched to the Four Seasons a couple of years ago for my Singapore trips. The service is still great . The property is showing its age. The gym is cramped , the treadmills need replacing and the gym should be expanded to take up some of the lounge space that no one seems to use. The one ninety restaurant is showing its age now so time for the owner to spend some $$$, compared to other hotels in the region ,,like the Mandarin in KL, they need to spend some serious $$ to complement their service as at over $500 per night I expect a bit more in terms of standard, and get it both regionally and globally .",3,,

Just a little off Orchard Rd, perfect walking distance to MRT and yet just enough to be out of the hustle and bustle. Also, if you have kids who love the zoos like we do, the hotel is at the right end of the city for a quick trip up the freeway.

Exceptional Service,MV_Webb,"Fantastic experience. It‚Äôs comforting to know that some hotels maintain their exceptional standard of service wherever they are located.

Our first experience of the high level of hospitality at FS Singapore came a week before we even checked in! We were in Singapore for a brief visit (staying at a different hotel), but needed to leave some luggage behind as we were planning to relocate to Singapore the following week.

A few days into my stay, I arrived to my room one evening to find a beautiful, huge blooming orchid plant awaiting me, with a kind note from the staff hoping the gift enhanced my stay since they could tell I appreciated orchids.

The prefect hotel if you're a business traveller ,TheUltimoTraveller,"This is one of those hotels that really cater to the needs of a business traveller. Upon getting off the transfer at the lobby of the hotel, the desk (at the outside of the hotel) is already waiting with your room key. With some verification, you're straight off to your room; no hassles at all. Large and spacious rooms, strong wifi connection, complemented with a decent late night room service dining menu, just makes this hotel a business traveller's dream hotel. Situated just at the fringe of the CBD, accessibility is easy. The restaurants within the hotel caters to a variety of tastes. Being at the fringe of the shopping district, also has its shopping and dining advantages. Overall there is nothing to complain about. Seriously, give it a try when you're in Singapore next. ",5,,

Staff, without exception, were excellent. Always friendly and responsive but without being intrusive which is an art in itself!

Room service was impeccable.  I returned from a day's sightseeing to find a note from the room staff saying that they noticed that the book I was reading did not have a bookmark so they provided one.

It's the little thoughtful touches that make this hotel stand out, kids toiletries placed in the bathrooms, and a huge basket of delicious choc chip cookies and bottles of apple juice were brought up for the kids on our first evebing,fruit basket placed in the suite everyday - filled with eye catching and exotic fruits.

Clean, well-maintained and included modern touches like a Nespresso machine and central lighting controls. Not the most stylish or avant-garde, which may explain some reviews that the rooms look dated, but the rooms and amenities were practical and pampering. Loved the plush beds and bedroom slippers.

Perfection!,jescott888,"From the moment we walked in, we knew this was the perfect place. Yes, the Four Seasons is a little more expensive than other hotels in Singapore and it's a little out of the way, but the property more than makes up for those factors.

The room was perfection. What a great way to start our trip!",5,,
Excellent Service,Patricia Colleen Murphy,"We arrived after 36 hours of travel on 5 planes and every single staff person we came in contact with was so respectful and caring and wanted to make sure we got rest right away. We were even offered a premium room right away even though it was 8 AM and check in was not until 3 pm. The room was beautiful, large, so comfortable, and had a great view. Beautiful building and lobby and though the pool area is small it was well appointed.",5,,
"fantastic hotel! a real value in the city and the best hotel by far. Great rooms, service and food in the best location",Matteoaless,This hotel should be on the top of the list. They do a great job with early arrivals and late checkouts and are super kind! They offer the best cocktail list in town with plenty of classics and very well prepared food. As a business traveler it is what I need and look forward to without any fuss. It is classic luxury close to everything,5,,
"LOCATION, EXCELLENT SERVICE, VERY FRIENDLY STAFF & COMFORTABLE ROOM",nancy t,I always enjoy staying in this hotel as the staff are very friendly & helpful.   Location is excellent. I didnt realised that I have stayed 25 times over the last 2 years and was pleasantly surprised to be reminded by them.

Enjoyed yet again,SBawa,"Four Seasons Singapore is a very nice and warm hotel . I have rated this hotel before a few years back, but wanted to update my review given that I have stayed in the hotel several times in last few years. Actually when it is Singapore... it is either Four Season or Grand Hyatt or MO hotel for me. The INdian food served needs improvement though.  Hotel is comfortable and you long to come back to the same hotel while in Four Season........................ Our stay did not disappoint yet again (I have stayed at this hotel few times before, many years ago). The service is impeccable, welcoming and you enjoy the room service also............ It is n the heart of CBD so you can easily reach your meeting destianations within minutes. Room Service is better than most other hotels in‚Ä¶",5,,
Special thanks to Cassandra (breakfast) and the lovely lady minding the pool on 20th floor (forgot her name sorry!),travelmonkey7777,"I just got back from a trip to Singapore and stayed at the Four Seasons hotel. I just wanted to say thank you so much for a lovely experience!  The service was personal and unforgettable. All the staff we encountered were so lovely and accommodating and added to my experience here in Singapore. I loved all the little touches, the effort that was made how genuine the staff were, all going the extra mile. I enjoyed the experience so much, I‚Äôve already started making plans to visit the Four Seasons in Japan for my honeymoon J. Hopefully it will just be as good as the one in Singapore!  P.s ‚Äì A special thanks to Cassandra (who works in the breakfast section) for being so helpful and lovely!

Best hotel in Singapore!,schumaster,"I went to visit my sister in Singapore and together we had one night staycation at Four Seasons. Everyone knows about the great service of Four Seasons hotels and we finally got to experience it. Needless to say we were fully satisfied. Excellent service from checking in to checking out. We arrived just before 9 am (due to my early arrival from Europe) and were granted an early check in, Staff were very professional and accomodating. The hotel was very beautiful with antiques everywhere. We stayed at a spacious Premier Room at 19th floor and had plenty of room between us. The next morning we had breakfast at their one ninety restaurant which was fantastic, and had decent varieties. We were sad to leave but couldn't wait for our next stay there.",5,,
Great Hotel,Globetrotter1955,"This is a fantastic Hotel, great location but best of all was the staff.

Simply Beautiful,Bruce W,"Location, service, luxury, beauty, this hotel has it all. Great staff, wonderful views, an excellent bar and terrific restaurants. Well located everything you want to do in Singapore is located close by. The best shopping on the island is literally a two block walk. I cant say enough good things about the staff and the service we received. I would not stay anywhere else in Singapore.",5,,

Magical anniversary stay,Roger B,Now back to reality after a wonderful 4 night stay to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.

Can't wait to return.,5,,
How to kill 2 birds with one stone: The brunch at the 4 Seasons Singapore,ZeGastronome,"It used to be THE hotel brunch. The offering was sumptuous, french, italian, thai, chinese, japanese. Roasted, grilled, pan fried or steamed. Prepared fresh on demand, right in front of your eyes. The presentation at its top with Chefs navigating the dinning room. Excellency was a fair description. One renovation later, you have an average, 3 star hotel kind of brunch. First of all, w/o the myriads of buffet stations there used to be, you notice how glaucous is the dining hall. No natural light, a fairly outdated d√©cor. Mid 80's at its best. Then you go the basic appetizers buffet and you cry. SDF must probably offer a wider selection. the awful experience continues with a miserable, second choice ingredients (ranger valley steaks grade for instance) entr√©e  menu: I beg all you‚Ä¶",2,,
Great Experience for a 4 day Business Trip,FridayKnights,"This is a truly 5 star hotel - the property, staff and attention to detail is fantastic and the little extras such as coffee in the lobby, or toothpaste when I have forgotten my own make this a hotel I will definitely return too. Thank you Four Seasons for a great stay!",5,,
Singapore Stopover,Skidog33,"Returning from Europe for a stopover in Singapore I decided to stay at the Four Seasons for a change and to be closer to Orchard Rd shopping.Stayed at Four Seasons just after opening maybe 20 years ago.Was very disappointed to find that hotel looked very dated and in need of renovation.Although service was acceptable I missed the convenience of a club lounge.Booked through Amex Fine Hotels with upgrade,there are much better hotels for less cost.",3,,
Fabulous Family Staycation,Tara F,Fantastic! I will do this again. Very family friendly and extremely reasonably priced kids menu. We had room service everyday. Near amenities and shopping.Suite was well thought through and very roomy.,5,,
Pure Luxury,waveguy777,This property surpasses the usual Four Seasons experience. The attention to details and level of service are impressive. Excellent restaurants and room service has extensive menu to accommodate all tastes. Hotel has a rooftop pool with lovely views across the city. Metro station is a 5 minute walk as well as Orchard Road for high end shopping. Highly recommend this hotel for the even the most discriminating customer.,5,,
"Nice location,good staff and rooms",Ume,Stayed here for 2nights in the month of January.  The hotel is centrally located and it is very easy to walk to Orchard road which is the central shopping area. Rooms were clean and the staff was very hospitable.

Will surely come back again!,Loretta P,"The Four Seasons will never disappoint you!  I will surely come back again!  Excellent service, comfortable rooms and very good locations near Orchard Road shopping area.  Very convenient for business and leisure travelers!",5,,
Stellar staff and service,Jkahn3,"I travel a lot for business and stay at many 4 and 5 star hotels.  The reason I am taking the time to write a review for the Four Seasons in Singapore is that they consistently exceeded my expectations, especially on the little things that make you truly feel welcome.  They managed to get my room service order exactly right (despite several special requests) every morning.  The concierge made you feel truly welcome and like she was just there to help you enjoy your stay - not to earn a commission.  The rooms were nice and the bed is very comfortable.  The pool is beautiful, but as a business traveler with not a lot of spare time, I would absolutely come back just for the attentive staff which made me feel truly welcome and at ease.",5,,
Never let you down,Goaskali,"This Four Seasons, while a city hotel does not disappoint! The location, decor and rooms were beautiful. We stayed 3 nights on a stop before Bali and although the hotel was crowded the service was top notch. Shout out to the concierge team! We tend to ask a lot of questions about local life and they were happy to chat with us and tell us so much about themselves and so proud of their island city! The breakfast buffet was over the top and I am a seasoned traveller, I'm still thinking about the delicious food. Best part was, why we were sad to depart we were handed an envelope from Concierge Paschal (spelling?) with a small notebook she put together with a lovely note about the history of Singapore and info for our next trip. She went above and beyond the call of service. This‚Ä¶",5,,
Great hotel in an excellent location,Derby88,"the Four Seasons lived up to its reputation.  The service was excellent, rooms large and well appointed and location excellent.  The hotel is just a short walk from Singapore's famous Orchard Road shopping area with lots of malls.",5,,
"Excellent, from start to finish",Alan C,We stopped in Singapore for three nights to break over journey to Bali. From the moment they met us at the airport to when they waved us goodbye the Four Seasons experience was in evidence......and that's despite the fact that we arrive when it was the Lunar (Chinese) New Year and the place was completely full. Thoroughly recommended. The Four Seasons never disappoints.  Tip: we were on the 18th floor. The higher the floor the further away you are from the hustle and bustle at street level.,5,,
The best hotel in Singapore for spoilt people :),Elisabeth K,"From arriving to the hotel until checking out. The room was lovely and spacious, also perfectly clean! Every detail was taken care of, nothing was ever missing. We had also a good upgrade offer and it was all worth it. It is a very quiet hotel and the service is personal and attitude is good! The breakfast was absolutely fantastic, also the food at the restaurant and bar. This place is for people, who really want the best quality and good relaxing atmosphere.  After staying in a couple of other 5* hotels in Singapore, the Four Seasons is just outstanding... And the shopping is very close ;) Thank You for this good experience! We will be coming back for sure!",5,,
Service par excellence,Stephen H,"My wife and me and friends stayed at the Four Seasons for 3 days prior to embarking on a cruise to Myanmar and back to Singapore. During our stay the staff were nothing less than really helpful and always smiling.  Furthermore the hotel restaurants were really excellent.  However a word to the wise, the prices for wine and spirits in Singapore are astronomical due to massive government taxes - e.g. a bottle of wine which would   cost in the UK about ¬£15-¬£18 would set you back nothing less than about ¬£35 and up. The piece de resistance for us was being allowed to return to the hotel after our cruise and spend the day pro bono in the health club from early in the morning until early evening as our flight back to UK was not until late",5,,
Great stay in a great hotel in a great city,Jeff B,"This hotel was in excellent condition throughout and the staff were friendly,helpful and very efficient. The health and fitness facilities were comprehensive and in  pristine condition. There is nothing negative to say about this hotel at all. In hindsight we might stay next time nearer the business district centre, although the MRT transport system is close by and, as expected, very clean and efficient so a minor issue. Orchard Road shopping is just around the corner and very convenient, as are the restaurants.",5,,
The best of the best!  If you are looking for a place to call home where everyone knows what you want before you do!,Sasha S,"A beautiful and elegant place that's energetic and exciting, but quiet and tucked away from the world.  This is an experience not to be missed.  It is a truly world class hotel deserving of every praise",5,,
Very Good Hotel,Kier_Wh,"The Four Seasons Singapore is one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore. We were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite on the 19th floor and was blown away but the amount of space and the type of decor used in the room. There were great paintings and tasteful furniture that really went well with the room. It offered a cozy feeling and found myself sitting on the couch with my legs up watching the tv with a cup of tea and an issue of The Economist.  The room made me feel like I was at one of my own homes, and I really enjoyed it. Service was great and the food and coffee downstairs matches the service. The restaurant is filled with very hardworking staff that seem to enjoy their work. The music is awful but after some investigating I found out it was because the GM signed a contract‚Ä¶",4,,

Breakfast is superb! We were there for workshops and we tried most of the buffet & snacks. Excellent food!  Location is of course ideal, close to orchard road and botanical garden. I went there for a jog in the morning. After full day workshop, room service was kind enough to organize my ""dirty"" sports gear. Appreciate that!

A world-class experience all around,DrFletch,"I've been fortunate enough to stay at some extraordinary hotels in my life, and I'd put the Singapore Four Seasons squarely in my top ten.  Our Deluxe Room had us wanting to stay for at least another week.

Nice stay at the Four Season,Kleine,We were welcomed warmly; the food is great; afternoon tea is very nice.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable.

"Nice in many places, but not the level I would expect",jackybristol,"Stayed in the Four Seasons for two nights on the weekend.  It was pretty good, as you would expect - gym, showers are great, beds very comfortable - kind of minimum requirement stuff when paying so much.  Here is why it did not get 5 stars for me:  I felt as though the level of service was not as I would expect from a 5 star hotel. I was dressed like a tourist and I was left wondering if I had looked more important, would this have been different. An example of this was our breakfast, after confirming it was included when the room was booked, we had to get the girl to check and confirm (which she did), then we were brought a bill 20 minutes later (which we queried again), and then when we checked out we were then again asked to pay for it! Three times we had to tell them - that‚Ä¶",3,,

Exceptional service sets Four Seasons Singapore apart from the rest,timsydney2015,"The quality of service at Four Seasons exceeds its competitors, having stayed at 2 other hotels in Singapore including those that claim a 6 star status, it truly over delivers.

Central hotel helpful staff,LBurston,Liked staying here although it was very busy during the christmas holidays. Concierge were extremely helpful booking and organising activities.

Well done to the hotel team",5,,
Boutique hotel feel very close to Orchard,siddmohan,What I Liked: - very cosy and warm feel as soon you enter the hotel - the best sleep I had in Singapore compared to Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental! - iPhone dock next to the TV which charges your phone but also allows you to play your music on the room speakers - very cool - Etro toileteries - Double doors to the bathroom makes it feel grand and good shower - Apples for you to pick up in the elevator lobby - It is walking distance to ION Mall which is the newest one on Orchard   What I did not like - Compared to the other hotels I stayed (mentioned above) the room felt smaller - No views to talk about,5,,

I could not be more pleased with the rooms and service of the hotel. The rooms are so elegantly furnished, very large in size and the bathrooms divine.  The concierge was especially helpful. I would give her extra bonus for making our stay enjoyable. She booked our night safari (a bit on the touristy side but nonetheless enjoyable) and went out of her way to get our tickets since the website was down. She also made fantastic restaurant reservations and a car shuttle to the airport. I did not want to leave and wish we did not move to the Sentosa side of Singapore.",5,,
Seven star hotel,eileen d,"This hotel is more than a five star.  We celebrated our family xmas this year at the Four Seasons - indulgent, magical, relaxing, luxurious, in short just perfect. Definitely the best place to stay in Singapore, walking distance to local shops and restaurants and an easy commute to historical sights.  Staff at the hotel pamper their guests without impacting on privacy, with grace and professionalism.  Children are indulged in a kids club, great food and xmas with Santa and the choral choirs was magnificent. The only drawback is the food which  is so so very good you don't want to risk eating anywhere else!! choose, dim sum, mezze, european, asian, each dish more wonderful than the next and what can I say about breakfast, you will feel like Alice in the a culinary wonderland.",5,,

no privacy,matthew b,"The hotel was dated and the staff refuse to give you privacy in your room they fail to know or ring the room in advance they simply just enter the room, this was raised with the hotel to date no responce back yet The room service menu was very blend and like everything in the hotel very over priced",2,,
Wonderful service and lovely hotel,Angeleez,"My husband and I recently stayed at Four Seasons for our anniversary and Christmas holiday. The check in was quick and streamlined.

We were welcomed with a lovely chocolate cake and sweets for our anniversary, and rose petals around our bath! The room also had a great view and bed was super comfortable. Location is about 5 min walk to reach Orchard road via the Hilton hotel (walk through indoors). Closest MRT is Orchard Station, which is about 10 mins walk away.

I would recommend this to anyone coming to Singapore since its a small walk from Orchard Road as well.",5,,
I love this place,SJC,"Obviously, it's part of a chain.  It's not quirky.  There are no surprises.  Sometimes that is exactly what you want.  After a long flight, to reach somewhere familiar where you know the service will be impeccable, where the staff name-check you from the moment you arrive (don't ask me why that's important - it just is), room service is rapid, the spa is first rate, the swimming pool on the roof is almost able to convince you that you're not in the middle of Concrete City, and the beds are brilliant, why go anywhere else?   You could stay at Raffles and be surrounded by tourists thronging for the obligatory Singapore Sling or stay at any of the other large corporate hotels, of which there are a multitude in this very odd city, but for me this place feels like coming home.

Class Facility,Jim M,I have stayed at the Four Seasons multiple times and several while our meetings were held elsewhere because of the consistently high quality of service no matter how you measure it. The staff has been the most friendly and helpful of any hotel I have stayed. I would rank the Four Seasons the top hotel in Singapore and I have stayed at them all and would say they compete with the top hotels worldwide. No matter how stressful the business I always leave there feeling relaxed due to the atmosphere and high standards for the room layout and cleanliness and professionalism of the staff. For work or vacation it receives my highest marks.     Jim McDonnell,5,,
In a class of its own..,KLtraveller2010,"This place has a sense of 'class' to it. A bit understated lobby compared to other hotels in Singapore but cosy and 'classy'. Staff are very helpful and friendly. Our rooms are spacious and they prepared some tidbits for the children which made them quite happy. We enjoyed our stay and the location is so convenient. One comment regarding the bathroom in the one-bedroom suite - the shower head is too close to the wall which make the water falls close to the wall which makes it uncomfortable to move your hands around during a shower. But overall, great hotel and service!",5,,
"Great location, great room and great service",L W,It is located a bit off from the CBD but it is also easily connected to most sites you would like to visit.

Truly 5 stars,Hossen Goburdhun,"We are a family of four with two youngish kids and we spent 4 nights there. On the way to the hotel in the hotel limo, we felt it would be a wonderful experience and we were not disappointed!  Staff was warm and always welcoming, reception made our check in seamless. The room was big enough to accommodate all of us and gave us a wonderful view of the city.  The concierge services were awesome, as well as the spa staff and those attending at the swimming pool. We appreciated a lot the thank  you note from spa staff waiting for us in our room on our way back from our therapy, the way all the Chargers cables were tidied up and arranged and the bookmarks  used by housekeeping to mark our books.

Chinese restraunt on the second floor is excellent,AroundTheWorld8080,"We didn't say here, but we dined at the Chinese restaurant on the second floor.  We arrived at 6pm when they opened, and we were seated at a beautiful table facing the window to the lush outdoor landscape.    The menu is extensive.  However, if you read the options carefully, you can create your own 4 course meal without having to pay the higher fixed price pre-menus that are also offered.  It does help if you already know how to discern what dishes are ""common fare"" that you could get in the US  versus which dishes are ""out of the ordinary"" to really take advantage of this dining experience.  The chef really surprised us with clever flavors on traditional dishes.  And a few surprises on new flavor combinations that were very unique.  The coconut dessert that looked like‚Ä¶",5,,

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.,Arjunrao76,"The staff is magnificent and the suites are absolutely incredible.

Relaxing and convenient,Aniko V,"Staying every other month in this hotel, I found the staff very helpful, they know their priority. Any questions or request has been answered in a short period of time. The facility is equipped with a rec center and the upper most pool is very pleasant. The room is nicely decorated and very funcional bathroom, too. The location is great, close to hospital, and subway. I heard their food is not the best, but other than that it is one of my top choice in Singapore.",5,,
Classic Quality Hotel,brentdsmith1,Not your dark hip hotel with music thumping where the lobby turns into a disco at night.  Just your classic quality hotel where everyone remembers your name and your preferences.    I've been staying here since 1997 and it has aged well with a few minor spruce ups here and there.  New bar is a nice addition as old bar space was sort of an afterthought even in the old days.  Perfection.,5,,
still as good,Al C,"Four Seasons Singapore is one of those hotels you do not hear much of.   It has been around for a while.    My recent stay has been excellent.   The location is top notched right on the edge of the Orchard shopping belt and therefore walk to shop and shop to walk you shopaholics.   Service is very friendly.   Food here is expensive but high quality.    Rooms are spacious and comfortable.    Add to that a swimming pool, tennis courts and a gym, you have everything you need for a stay.   Keep it up, this is my preferred hotel if I need to stay near Orchard again.",4,,
Best hotel with great service !!!,David T,"I had a great experience from the moment that I entered the hotel until the day I left it. The staff is amazing. They really look at you and think what will make your stay their more comfortable. When I got to the hotel early in the morning they sent me to the room a complementary breakfast without asking for. In the morning when I wanted to go for a jogging, the reception staff offered a jogging map with different routes. When I returned, the doorman was ready with a cold bottle of water (and he knew my name, amazing!). The room was constantly been cleaned with attention to every detail (including leaving me a bookmark since I had a reading book without such). You really feel that they put attention to every detail. I highly recommend.",5,,
BRILLIANT LOCATION - QUIET,glau888,"Stayed here 2 nights and loved it. Just a 3 minute walk to get to ION and the MRT.  Very convenient and quiet location.

The high quality facility you expect from a Four Seasons,LCandBC,"Stayed for business and was what you expect (in a good way) from a four seasons hotel - elegant public spaces, good sized room, comfy bed, good desk set up for working w/ accessible plugs and comfy chair, elegant bathrooms, and nice set up for hairdryer in the room (like the UK, no plugs in the bathroom).  Included basic wifi - or an option to purchase higher speed - the regular access was fine for email and basic web stuff.   A bonus was a nice - but very humid - run through the botanical gardens in the early AM.  The bellhop offered a map with a nice running loop which went through the gardens and some neighborhoods,  Felt perfectly safe running along (as a female) before dawn.    Cost about S$32 in a cab from the airport to the hotel during morning rush hour.",4,,

Reception- I had a problem with them because they were incredibly hard to reach via phone however the concierge always made sure they called me back when they were available, and one of the receptionists misquoted the room rate when we decided to extend our stay (yeah, two weeks in this hotel was just not enough!)

"Beautiful room, impeccable service",CelloYellow T,"I spent four nights here on work - and it was such a lovely hotel to come back to at the end of each day.   The room was large and well appointed with a decent view. The loo was the high point - very elegantly done with lots of space. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was nice and quiet - which is really what you need from a hotel room. There were two universal plug points as well as a travel adapter in the room which makes things a lot easier.    And the service was excellent throughout. One day I came back to find a bookmark in my book replacing the scrap of paper I had been using, with a hand written note.

Good stay!,ankitarora2014,"I stayed at the hotel for single night during my business trip. The location is nice with decent sized rooms. I would like to specially mention a word about the reception staff. It took them little longer since another customer before me had various inquiries. At the time of my check-in, reception staff apologized for the delay and they offered me a glass of juice in order to make up for the that. This shows their focus on serving each customer with perfection, which i really liked. The room service was great and quick and they have lot of vegetarian options with buffet and food worth every SGD. The only reason for 4 stars is that room did not have a great view, the probable reason was they gave room to me on 6th floor. However, it's worth the stay at the price of the stay!",4,,
Elegant hotel with amazing service,Splash135,"My friend and I stayed here in May of 2014.  We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and allowed to check in earlier than the standard check-in time.  Our room was large, comfortable, quiet and cool.  So much so that we slept in on a number of days just enjoying the luxurious linens on the lovely beds.  The bathroom was beautiful with plenty of space and high-end amenities.  The breakfast is vast and delicious with more choices than one would ever need.  While the pool is slightly on the small side, the service more than makes up for it.  I was relaxing with my eyes closed on a lounge-chair and upon opening them, I found a glass of iced water with lemon, a decorative orchid and a cold scented cloth waiting on the small table next to me.

"A reliable, central Orchard road hotel",twizm,"The Four Seasons is located in the middle of Orchard road, close to all the malls one would like to go. The subway is located a block away as well, making it easy to go around SG. Do note that you may have to hike a little bit (100 metres) at an incline coming from Orchard. However, there is another route inside the hotel, connecting it with the Hilton.  The hotel room is very big. It may require a renovation soon but it's very well maintained. The staff are friendly and would gladly help their guests. I have never eaten at the hotel, so I do not have any comments about their food.",5,,
Discreet & peaceful oasis in the heart of Singapore,Moleseyboy,"I stayed for only two nights at the Four Seasons hotel in Singapore last week, and wish I'd had a week to take advantage of its calming influence.  It's one of the few really decent hotels that my company includes in its corporate list, and I've been fortunate enough to have stayed here a few times over the past years.  The rooms are spacious, elegantly appointed, quiet and in possession of glorious bathrooms and the most comfortable beds.  The restaurants in the hotel are under-stated and excellent, and the bar is both inside and outside, depending on your mood.  The hotel is characterised by outstanding service - neither obsequious nor over-bearing, but perfectly judged in its friendliness but not over-familiarity.  If only all hotels were like this, Tripadvisor might well go‚Ä¶",5,,

Excellent staycation,mandya162,"We live in Singapore and spent four nights at the Four Seasons in October 2014 when our home renovation went awry. Everything was perfect. We had a one bedroom suite which was comfortable and classy. The hotel is brilliantly located and I enjoyed walking to Tanglin Mall and other places on Orchard Road. We especially enjoyed the Terrazzo Bar in the hotel. It's hard to believe, until you actually visit it, that a place so close to the bustle of Orchard Road can feel so peaceful and resort-like. We enjoyed breakfasts, coffees, aperitifs and dinners and I particularly enjoyed spending a few hours there one morning over coffee with my laptop and books for company. The decor is soothing and tropical with comfortable wrought-iron chairs and lush greenery, and the staff are fantastic.‚Ä¶",5,,

A hotel at the heart of Singapore,Purn0m0,"Stayed for three night last week. Located at the heart of the city make it really enviable, accessible practically from anywhere. It is unfortunate that due to my air sickness, I did not go to the pool and fitness centre, the two places that I never miss when staying at a hotel. The breakfast was quite superb with a wide choice of variety but hot food was not that plenty as in Shangri la or other five star hotel. My room has a view toward Orchard Road which is truly beautiful throughout the day. The level of service is world class, upon check out, my luggage is already kept inside the taxi while I am having breakfast. Never experience something like this before!",4,,
A classy property in SG,DK1989,Spent 4 nights here during the tennis WTA finals in October and it truly is a beautiful hotel with proximity to transport and shopping hubs. Quite not understand people's comment about room needing an upgrade or refurb? As if you are going to spend a year there that's why you need a refurbished room? Because the room is fine with sufficient space and functionality especially the bathroom is huge. It's the people that make this property amazing. Always greeted promptly with a smile and courtesy and the bellmen offered lots of assistance upon luggage delivery and even greeted me with my name when he spotted me in the lobby. Breakfast was excellent with great choices and the bar does offer great drinks and ambience. Didn't check out the pool due to the schedule but it looked to me‚Ä¶,5,,
"Very nice hotel, needs slight upgrade to be fully at Four Seasons level",ElizaebethB,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Singapore for three days at the end of October 2014.  It is a very decent place to stay and the service is excellent.  Compared to other Four Seasons I have been to around the world--particularly in some vacation spots--this would be on the lower end of the chain.  This may simply be because the hotel gets a lot of use and probably is at the end of its lifecycle before having furniture and carpets replaced.  I would recommend the hotel for business travel, but I would manage my expectations about having an extraordinary experience.  That being said, the food is good, the pool is excellent and the workout room is the best I have ever seen, with great equipment and free weights.",4,,

A perfect hotel at a prime location.,L17S,"I stayed with my family  in this hotel for 3 nights. I took 2 rooms. The hotel has a great location. At the back of Orchard Rd., and few minutes from Ion shopping center. The rooms are huge and comfort with all the amenities. The pool and the spa area are very nice. The staff  and the service are at a very high class. I asked for an extra bed for my child. They told me that they will charge me for 80SD per night plus tax. I agreed. During checkout I was told that they decided not to charge me for the extra bed. ""Small money"", but a huge gesture. This is one of the reasons for staying at the Four Seasons where ever I can....They make us feel wonderful. We will recommend this hotel to all our family members and freinds. No doubt that we will be back.",5,,
Amazing service,Julie D,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel last week and was very happy. The staff are exceptionally attentive and helpful.

Disappointing.,Paola B,"Overall, we found the room layout disappointing and unpleasant (sort of a triangle). We had 804. The decor was boring and uninspired. I could have been anywhere. We stay in luxury hotels about 150 nights per year between leisure and work. This is not a hotel I would visit again.   Telling us at check in that our wireless would be limited to 3 devices was also unbelievable. At the Four Seaons? You are going to nickle and dime me about internet? And how can 3 people in a suite only have three devices - between phones, ipads and computers, that is nuts. Even at the Hyatt in Union Square NY where I recently stayed, as a single person I was allowed up to 5 devices. Shamefull for the Four Seasons.   At the gym, there was a great selection of machines.

The Sunday brunch could still have been better,singaporeguest2009,"My husband, my mom and I went back to Four Seasons Hotel last Sunday for the brunch again, after they replied to my last review in April this year, that there is now a great revamp in their selection of foods etc.    It is a great improvement, but could still have been better, as there is not a lot of hot dishes (almost non-existent) in the buffet to pick section. We are glad that the main course is now included inside the brunch. However, they could perhaps ask the patrons if they would like to have fries or not, as for some people such as my husband, they do not take fries, and it is just a waste of time (and cooking oil) to serve each patron the fries with the main dish.

The first impression was the traditional US hotel, with its colour theme, antiques and floral display. I could feel it has been opened for years, and you could not link the word ""modern"" to this hotel.  Receptionist was friendly and check in was quick.

Having stayed at other Singapore hotels for business travel, I would rate this as not the best choice and believe the Tripadvisor community has it right with the rankings.  I choose Shangri-La as the best hotel I've stayed in thus far.  I would rate the FS above the Mandarin Oriental.  Rooms are best laid out in terms of size, amenities, decor and materials at the FS.  The MO is the most fancy/elegant perhaps, but the FS is most sumptuous and typical FS excellent.

The room has a good size, with many modern amenities and very good bed,  bathroom was very good size as well. Breakfast was superb and I had dinner as well one night at 190 restaurant, which was very pleasant. The pool and gym facilities were terrific, as you can really swim in it, and the gym has a good number of options, what is quite good during a business trip, specially when you are still suffering the jet lag and/or adapting to the time zone difference ( as it was my case ). As the final points, location was very convenient, close to Orchard Road, and a short taxi ride to the main financial center - service was also very good, helpful and cordial.",5,,
"Totally Recommend - great location, beautiful hotel, just loved our stay",Lynda C,"Totally recommend staying here - Four Seasons Singapore.   Location was great, away from the busy Orchard Avenue, but close enough to walk to (3 minutes). Nicely tucked away.  Excellent service, and lovely staff.

Elegant hotel in the center of Singapore,djmontano,Its Orchard location probably makes this the most well-located luxury hotel in the city. Expect the usual uncompromising Four Seasons standards when it comes to service and affording you an excellent stay.,4,,
Warm and welcoming,aoc134,"The staff at Four Seasons Singapore were warm and welcoming at every encounter. Smoothly professional, but not at all stuffy, their attention to detail was excellent. At breakfast this morning I was offered another coffee and when I said I had to leave for the airport, I was immediately offered a coffee to go, which appeared in a flash! Housekeeping was excellent, with nice touches like leaving a cleaning cloth with my reading glasses and tidying my cables so they were the perfect length from socket to device. There were 4 bottles of free water in the room, replenished daily, as well as Fiji water available for purchase.

Perfect,Darcyz_13,"Everything about our stay with Four Seasons Singapore was perfect. On arrival we were upgraded to a room that was more suitable for our family configuration. Our young lads were fussed over by the ladies in Reception and given cold juice and bags. The room was huge and had an amazing view especially of the thunder storms rolling into Singapore. The beds were very comfortable and being able to control the lights and curtains through the alarm clock was fun. Breakfast was thoroughly enjoyed by the whole family, especially the mini trifles and the juices. The bar was great and the cocktail pitcher made for a great night in.

Stay here - great location and service ,suzicat,"This is a great hotel, well located for shopping and spacious rooms. The reception staff were friendly and efficient and we upgraded to a junior suite which was well worth the extra charge - large living area and a dining table along with a small cloakroom in addition to the bathroom. Beds are amazingly comfortable. The gym is good, the rooftop pool brand new and there is a 'Club' area with refreshments on floor 3. Breakfasts options are endless and catered to my fussy tastes. We enjoyed the excellent g&ts at the ninety one bar also. On check out, which was a day earlier than planned, the staff were accommodating and professional. Overall my stay exceeded my expectations and is an experience I would highly recommend. ",5,,
Very comfortable Business hotel,Sheikh M,"Stayed there for three nights in first week of September. Very good business hotel, good location, and very well decorated rooms.

"Poor and Slow Service, Dated Rooms, ABSYMAL.",LJH323,"Still a guest at the hotel as I write this, am on night 5 of an 8 night stay and am completely regretting my choice.   We booked 3 rooms (2 suites + 1 Deluxe room), and first of all, the service has been ABYSMAL.   Neither myself nor my Chinese guests were accorded with welcome drinks upon arrival, but the very next day we saw the hotel providing two of their Western guests with said drinks at check-in. When this was brought up to the duty manager, he curtly brushed it aside, saying that it was probably because we checked in late. We checked in before midnight, but I don't see how that affects anything.  I spoke to the same duty manager again on the second day, CLEARLY requesting (And paying) for a pick up for a VIP guest that evening at the CIP terminal by a Toyota Alphard.‚Ä¶",2,,
Excellent City hotel - quite yet near to Orchard Road,Yan Seong L,"I have been staying in here twice in 2013, one in June and another in October 2013, all for short family trip to Singapore for shopping and foods...Nice location, quite even facing Orchard Boulevard, walking distance to all shopping places in Orchard road as well as fancy restaurants. No breakfast was included for my room, but there is McDonald just next to Hilton which is again walking distance (cover) from Four Seasons.   The hotel gave me free upgrade on my 2nd visit in October 2013.",5,,
Four Seasons is one of the Finest Stays,Navin C,"I stayed here years ago for a few days on my way home from Bangkok.  The service was impeccable.

"Quiet, regal & efficient",BGKoshy,"FOUR SEASONS SINGAPORE   is located within walking distance of Orchard Road in the quietest neighborhood of the district.   The nearest malls are Wisma Atria, Tangs and Takashimaya ( the best ) -- all nearby.  The sleep quality is superb with perhaps the finest beds and linen in the country.   We took a suite on the 16th floor with two rooms and two bathrooms and were very happy.  The breakfast could be improved upon for both range and quality and I ve told them to work on it.  The spa is spacious and my pedicure was masterfully done by the trained therapist for around S$ 65.  The club does not seem to function at all.

The pool is not what you expect from 4 seasons .  However , there were some positives as well that saved the holiday .

The newly renovated 20th floor pool is fantastic and you can enjoy a wonderful view of the city. My daughter happened to be turning 13 later that week (after our stay) and the staff sent up a birthday cake as well as cookies and drinks.  We had not even told them it was her birthday!

The service was lovely during our visit, and the food for breakfast at One-Ninety was great. The 20th floor pool had just had a revamp and was fantastic.  Only let down was that we weren't able to check in at 3pm as the room wasn't available - can be excused as we booked the day before and they were at full capacity and had probably already advised the previous occupants could have late check out.

Walls seem to be really thin, i could hear people next door 4. pool is really small - not worthy of a 5 star hotel 5. quality of toileteries doesn't have a premium feel  some of the things i liked - location is good, next to Orchard road - room service is quick and food quality is very good - wifi speed is good",3,,

The hotel lobby is not intimidating and grand  but  just the right cozy size. It's also usually quiet and not crowded.  Food served in the meetings and restaurant were good.  Service is quite friendly and efficient.  Several days of meetings went very well in the conference room with the help of the staff's unobtrusive service.

Staff is very friendly in a professional way. Pool was quite small (there is a second pool, but it was under renovation). But the small size was made up with an excellent service at the pool: Kind ladies offered juice or water, in the morning, you could find a coffee, tea or an apple; small things, but they made the big difference to ""normal"" hotels.

We arrived before our room was ready and I had to prepare for a meeting. The Filipina lady at the front desk was nice enough to arrange for me to freshen up at the Spa. They even had someone come up to iron the dress I was going to use.  The person that impressed me the most was this woman from housekeeping who was in charge of the pressing. She was so knowledgeable about fabrics and how to care for them. I could tell she took a lot of pride in her job.  The property itself is not so new, but it nevertheless it's still aging gracefully. The elevator takes a while to get you up and down between floors. for instance.  It was a pleasurable stay all-in-all.  ",5,,
Good,Jaeun K,i enjoyed the hotel a lot it takes about 30 mins from the airport by taxi room was good but it looks antic a bit the breakfast was not so the best,5,,
Excellent for service,GeoffKliger,The service at this hotel is excellent. Staff are friendly but not servile and we were recognised and acknowledged at all times.  The location suited us and the only fault we could find was that the Hotel has aged a bit when compared to some of it's competitors. It was however well appointed with all we could desire.,4,,
Not worth the price you pay. The fitness area looks tired and dated and the pool is anything but inviting.,SajMit,"The Four Seasons Singapore fails to live up to it's globally renowned brand name. Although the rooms are uber luxurious and comfortable, the fitness area is far from five star while the pool is non descript and tiny and fails to warrant a comment. What needs a prompt change are the bathroom accessories which are packed in rainbow coloured tubes an absolute misfit for a business hotel of such repute. Imagine your bath soap packed in a bright green wrap. I almost expected to see some candy pop out when I opened it. The service however is very good but for the price you pay, this is not unexpected.",2,,
Best hotel experience I have every had,Rita C,Incredibly service from the hotel staff - I felt like a VIP.  The hotel is incredibly beautiful and classy without being stuffy.  The food was amazing and my room was heavenly.  I've decided it is the only place I will stay when I'm in Singapore.  It really is a class above anywhere else I've stayed.,5,,
Recommended when in Singapore,RobertChew-MY,"Stayed for two nights when visiting my sis in SG.   Checked in is fast. We asked for quite room when book through Agoda and the placed us is a corner room, which is great.   Room is spacious. My wife particularly love the bathroom, which is very well designed. Bed is very comfortable.  What I like most is the evening housekeeping. Apart from the usual bedtime setting, you are provided with CD and book ""Guide to deep sleep"".  Location wise, it's great. It's connected to Hilton where you can passed through and you are at Orchard Road! Shop shop shop shop ! Hard Rock Cafe is just few minutes walk away.  Buffet breakfast is good and varieties from local and international. They even serve honeycomb! How natural can you get for honey!  A complaint is that the morning paper was removed‚Ä¶",4,,

Great for couples!,marinadom,"We sadly only had 1 night on this trip but spent it wisely at the Four Seasons Singapore, just about as good as you can get in hotel accommodation and we were not disappointed. Four Seasons has long been world renowned as one of the best luxury chains in the world but they don‚Äôt settle for just having the reputation of the best, the continue to boldly march into the future, a trend we were frankly surprised to see from such an old school luxury hotel chain, a fact that made us very happy.

We would not stop anywhere else whilst in Singapore,Bill J,"We commented that this Hotel did not provide facilities that allowed one to shower and freshen up before the late evening flight back to the UK. This was the only fault we found with the Four Seasons during our stay in May 2013. We are delighted to say that our recent stay in June 2014 at the Four Seasons that this has now been rectified with lounge facilities, refreshments and shower facilities provided. Take my word this hotel has to be one of the best in Singapore; we would not stop anywhere else.",5,,
A quick stop over,Annmarie C,We only had the pleasure of staying here for one night on our way back home but we had such a fabulous experience that we would stay again and have recommended to family to stay here whilst in Singapore.   The staff were very accommodating and extremely attentive. We were made to feel very special and the little extras such as homemade cookies for my little boy were a very nice touch.   The suite was absolutely devine and the room service we ordered was absolutely delicious and a very nice way to end our family holiday.   We would definitely come back and stay here again. ,5,,
Well trained staff,JasmineChia,"Just want to comment about the staff in this hotel. I've never come across a hotel where they are so attentive to my needs. Even hotel brands from similar category, they have not surprised me this much with their attention to details.  While I was out having lunch, the housekeeping people came. They nicely replaced my magazine that I've used as mouse pad with a proper one. Something that never occur to me at all. Then when they noticed the cables on my table was everywhere, they tie my cables with a cable clip. Ensuring that my table is neat and comfortable to work with.  When checking out, their bellboy checked if we require a cab when retrieving our luggage from our room. We didn't follow him to lobby immediately but I think they take make effort to check and once we're done‚Ä¶",5,,
Ritz or Four Seasons (or St Regis)?,KLTokyo,"From time to time, I stay at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore.   Before making the reservation, I need to remind myself which hotel would I want to stay this time.  I end up staying at Ritz because it is convenient to my office; however, if the location is not an issue, then, my second choice would be Four Season.  It's bit of an old school but I like the atmosphere more than the Ritz.  Now with St Regis opening up, then, it's becoming more and more difficult to make the choice.  If I were on a business and with my wife; then, I would still stay at Ritz as it has a bigger swimming pool.  If I am on holiday in Singapore, then, I might stay at St Regis or Four Seasons.  More convenient for shopping.   Anyway, they are all good hotels and very difficult choice.",4,,
Love this place!,Lisa_usaexpat,We have enjoyed all of our visits here. Great location. Such quiet rooms and comfy beds. We really enjoy the breakfast buffet too. We actually live in Singapore and go to the Four Season's for overnight getaways. Great service.,5,,

Outstanding service,CoachDG,"The hotel facilities are very nice and clean, as you would expect at a top level hotel, but it is the outstanding service that sets the Four Seasons apart. I am not too picky about my room - I always look for the balance of best price, decent clean room, and good location for my business travel. But for the same (or nearly the same) price, I will choose Four Seasons over any other hotel in Singapore.",5,,

Smiles in Singapore,MrTraveller88,"Returning to Singapore after a 9 year gap we were advised by many to stay down in the bay area at one of the new hotels there and we considered the Pan Pacific. After much consideration we decided instead to stay back in the Orchard Road district where we had been last time round and also chose to return to the Four Seasons hotel which is where we had also stayed during that trip.  This proved on both cases to be the right decision for us. We visited the bay area but preferred the vibe around Orchard Road so were happy we'd selected a hotel up there and The Four Seasons made us feel incredibly welcome and their attention to detail, care and attention and 'happy' staff all contributed to another memorable Singapore experience.  All the staff were incredibly friendly and willing‚Ä¶",5,,

Awesome!,Karen M,"Huge room with large marble bathrooms, feather beds, pillows and blanket.  They gave us box seats for the Heineken open Tennis match.  We were the only ones in the Four Seasons box.

A Jewel on Orchard,Saint-Emillion,"From the moment I stepped into the hotel, everyone was welcoming. As a team, the front desk, concierge, room service and housekeeping have collectively rendered excellent service. Kudos to Woo Houyu, Amanda and the entire housekeeping department, the female operator who often assists me in the middle of night, Ganeson (concierge) and many others whose names escaped me.  Splendid location, within walking distance to malls, restaurants and bars. My spacious premiere room and hotel premises are always clean.

Elegant AND comfortable; perfect business traveler hotel,Diana B,"Love this hotel for being elegant and luxurious, but in a way that felt cozy and comfortable. Attention to details like the impressive service and effort of remembering your name and remembering your dining and reading preferences puts this hotel experience as one of my favorites.

Quiet haven off busy Orchard Road,Bonny L,"Set back from the road and surrounded by greenery, the Four Seasons provides a quiet retreat from the shopping and traffic of the nearby Orchard Road area.  The staff of the hotel are excellent, the rooms are spacious and the swimming pools are lovely. I recommend the hotel for business travelers (free Wifi in the room) and for leisure (relaxation and recreation). My only complaint is the high price of the food - a colleague was shocked at the bill for coffee and orange juice was S$ 27! We went to the local coffee shops on Orchard Road for the next two mornings.",5,,

However, this could have been a Hilton, or Marriott ....the location was helfpul.  One item they need to fix, is the business center printer (there is only one) and it looks 15 years old, and has tape holding it together....needs to be changed.  Bar prices are absurd...$31 US for a shot of tequila.",3,,
Excellent hotel bar with impeccable service..,Geoff M,"Was just passing through the hotel while visiting the Club 21 store, decided to stop and have a drink in the downstairs bar.  The bar itself is decorated in dark warm tones that instantly makes you feel relaxed and at ease.  The received was faultless, I didn't have to think about a thing (which I enjoy) suggestions were made regarding drinks and I was offered lunch without having to ask for a menu.

Order versus customisation,Andy392,"The Four Seasons in Singapore is in a great location with a passageway to Orchard Rd and walking distance to the Botanic Gardens. As you would expect the facilities are first class including a wonderful family pool on the roof. My room was well-equipped (including an iron and board) with a pleasant view over that area of the city. Breakfast offers a wide range of choices from Asian and European cuisines. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The one small problem area came in my room setup, especially with the evening turndown. At other Four Seasons there is a real emphasis on customizing the room to your needs (especially since I was there for a week) but here everything had to be set up their way.

Hotel still generally in good condition, especially public areas. our rooms seemed spruced up from last time; brighter bathrooms, better TV etc. Superb staff, very impressive throughout. Food markedly better than last time too. Breakfast very good (from very bad last time out), but still not worth it. It isn't 'that' good! Bar menu tasty with some great options. Overall, given the location and brand, i don't know why you'd stay anywhere else.",5,,
Outstanding,Voyager712,"Located right off the bustle of Orchard Road, the Four Seasons is an oasis of calm in what can be a very busy city.  The slightly dated look and feel of the reception & areas add to the sense of calm, as do the residential floors and rooms. The rooms are massive, well outfitted and extremely comfortable. It's the attention to detail - like a charger for Apple devices, apples near the elevators on guest floors, and CD of music to sleep - which sets this hotel apart from all the other chain hotels in the area. There's a well equipped gym & spa - which is available for use if you check out in the morning & like a quick shower before heading to the airport in the evening, after a days work. The staff are professional and pleasant without being obsequious.  While the rooms don't come‚Ä¶",5,,

I also really enjoy its classic simplicity, it's not over the top and vulgar.  The pool is quiet and has a good view of the city.  The gym is clean and one of the better one's I've been to for city-based hotels.  I love being so close to Orchard Rd, but having just enough distance that you are removed from all the traffic.  I especially appreciate being within walking distance to the Botanic Gardens.  The staff were helpful at suggesting places to go to, and were very professional.    Every time I leave FS Singapore I feel refreshed.",5,,

The linen is so soft we bought some from the gift shop for home. The furnishings in the room are getting a little tired and I would hope mgmt. will look at replacing soon. This didn't impact our stay but another 12 months or so and it would.  Most of the staff are lovely and attentive. However the pool staff at the fitness pool were hit and miss.

We booked a standard one-bedroom suite under the American Express Platinum Fine Hotels and Resorts program and was upgraded to a beautiful and spacious Governor one-bedroom suite on the 19th (top)  floor. The hotel management asked us the names and age of our children in advance. When we arrived at the room, we found special sweet treats for each of them with their names written on the cards. They also prepared the two rollaway beds already so the boys can rest straight away after a long day of travelling. This is truly the best hotel service!

Service makes the difference,TheRainIn,We stayed three nights with our four kids. Pluses: great service - difficult to fault and they go the extra mile (e.g. made pancakes and hash browns specially for our kids for breakfast); good location 5 minutes from MRT and 2 minutes from Orchard Road; nice rooftop pool and jacuzzi; quality fixtures and fittings and an overall air of being well kept up. Minuses: quite an old building now (by Singapore standards) but it doesn't really show...just not quite as dazzling as some of the newer ones; not cheap.

The Sunday brunch was not worth the money.,singaporeguest2009,"My mom, my husband and I came to the one-ninety coffee shop for Sunday brunch after church service last Sunday.

The main course and other hot dishes could only be ordered from the ala-carte menu, but then we need to pay extra for these items, so we did not bother to do so.   If you are a seafood lover, then their wide variety of seafood choices is going to satisfy your tastebud. However, as I am allergic to most of the seafood, I only got very limited choice.

But the most shocking for me is that when my room was still not ready, the staff sent me to the club room for waiting, which was good, then I want something from my luggage, instead of bringing my luggage to me, they ask me to see my luggage which kept at taxi waiting area outside the hotel main entrance, and let me open my luggage in such an open area!

Whether it was the warm greeting by name, the helpful answers to any questions, the smiles, winks and jokes with our two kids and the awesome (and bottomless!) fresh juices by the pool, the service was up to the Four Seasons standard.  The kids were particularly tickled by the individualized baked goodies that greeted them in the room on the first night.  As a family of four (kids aged 7 and 10), finding a hotel that could accommodate us all in one room in Singapore was an unbelievable challenge.

We decided to give it a shot, but after 5 minutes called the front desk to ask about switching to a non-smoking room.  They said that since we had already checked in to this room, we would have to pay for a half day room rental to switch to a different room.  Seriously?  Why do they even have a non-smoking floor in this day and age?

A little disappointed,Diane S,"Checked into the hotel this afternoon and everyone was extremely helpful.  We upgraded the room and were delighted with the size of the room.  The negatives that I see is that the wallpaper is coming off the wall in numerous places, the rug in the bathroom is dirty, and the baseboard around the room is very dusty.  The chair and ottoman is old and very tired as well as dirty.  Our expectations staying at a Four Seasons are higher than what the standards are at the Singapore Four Seasons.

Every single member of the staff recognizes you by name, all the time. They are extremely courteous and can't wait to go out of their way to help you.  The location is absolutely perfect for Orchard road too.",5,,
Four Seasons - my only choice from now on in Singapore,Christopher H,"With all of the business travel that I do....one of my best hotel experiences.  Top notch service, staff greet by name (a bit scary af first), touch enabled key cards, wonderful beds, quite rooms, nice TV, most awesome bathroom -- the list goes on.

Everything just great,br40,"Everything about this hotel is just great. The quality of the guest rooms, pools, gymnasium, restaurant, as well as all of the staff, is without fault. The rooms have all the best amenities expected of a top hotel; the beds are super soft, and the shower is exceptionally good.  Whether you go to the gym, pools, or any of the lounges, there are friendly professional staff on hand to provide refreshments and anything else you may wish for. There is a great ambience and quality about this hotel that makes you feel very comfortable, and safe. This is not a ""low cost"" hotel, but you do get the best quality for what you pay for. The only criticism(a minor one only) is that the tiles in the 2 pools are somewhat slippery, and you need to take care with this.",5,,

"Impeccable Service, lovely room",cmstvl,"Recently stayed a total of five nights at the Four Seasons...three on our first stay and two on our return.  In both cases, the rooms were lovely...spacious, beautiful bathrooms, quiet, comfortable bedding. First room contemporary, second more traditional. The service is second to none.  Requests were handled immediately and the room service was excellent.  The hotel staff was warm and welcoming...always a smile and a greeting.  Loved the location of the hotel...just a bit off the beaten path but a stone's throw to Orchard Road, shopping and excellent transportation.  The breakfast was superb and, once again, the service perfection.  The adorable Lien Tran greeted us on our return with enthusiasm and delight and I felt I had come home.  An altogether lovely experience.",5,,
Very nice,DenJenK,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which was spacious and well maintained during our 5 night stay.  The suite had two bathrooms (one with a shower only and another full bathroom) and plenty of space for clothes and luggage storage. The only downside of the room was that the living area connected through to another room and it was not particularly sound proof.   The breakfasts at the hotel were fantastic but the morning rush is busy so if you can wait until a little later to go down.  The concierge was helpful and assisted in booking tickets, dinner reservations, babysitters and car transfers. Like all Four Seasons hotels they catered very nicely for the children with a range of amenities and gifts to entertain them. DVDs can be borrowed from reception as well.  I would certainly‚Ä¶",4,,

My Pet Dog 1st Birthday Party!,Ken S,"Just 4 days ago, which is on the 21st Feb 2014. I booked an Executive Suite for my darling daughter ""Strudel"" 1st birthday. It is my first time having a birthday party for pet in the hotel. There are a few hotels in Singapore that accept pet but however they can only accommodate at most 1 in the room. I'm please that Four Seasons Singapore make an exception for me to bring up to 3 pets that very day. (Perhaps maybe is because i book a bigger room than their normal room?) but still i want to say a BIG thank you for the exception made. Checking in was fast as if as they have already expected me to arrive at that time ard 2pm.

Excellent hotel,TwoBoomers,"We stayed here for 4 nights and were thoroughly pleased with the hotel itself, the room (couples floor), the food, amenities, and very importantly the staff whose customer service was amongst some of the best we have experienced over several decades of travel around the world. Although not in the marina area (where we have stayed before), this hotel sits just off Orchard Road and worked out wonderfully. We bought the bed and breakfast package directly with Four Seasons and the cost was very good compared to the 'going rates' in Singapore these days. Whilst it was just us two, this place is marvelous for children too as they are well attuned to it, even providing robes, et al for kids. In short we were very happy with our choice to spend a few days at this hotel. It's not big by‚Ä¶",5,,

The staff are extremely attentive and gracious and any problems are very quickly resolved.  Our room was not ready upon arrival (after check in time) however they offered us some complimentary spa treatments for our trouble.

Time to buck up,5_starhotellover88,"I first stayed at this hotel at the turn of this century and returned some half a dozen times thereafter. After an absence of quite a few years, I returned to it in February 2014. It has lost the spark and the panache which marked it some 15 years ago as one of Singapore's top hotels. While it remains a good hotel, it has, in my view, lost its distinction. I recall Tyler Brule saying in his FT column recently thay although he descends on this hotel, among a handful of others in Singapore, there is not joy in the act. He is right. It is time for the hotel to buck up! Let me list a three elements which a Four Seasons Hotel ought never  let slip, although the hotel in Singapore did precisely that : First, during my stay, there was no turn-down service. There wasn't even a card‚Ä¶",4,,
First class service,barneysgirl,"I was there for a wedding in January. On the outside the hotel looks aged, but inside the rooms and facilities are still quite decent. I like that they have two pools (one for laps w/ no kids!). The location is also quite good, just a short walk away from Ion Center and the rest of Orchard Road.  What stands out though is their service. On our first day, the doorman and the cab driver miscommunicated, and we ended up next to the river instead of River Valley street. At 3:30pm we couldn't find a cab anywhere. We called the hotel and they helped, but to no avail. In the end, they sent a complimentary hotel car to pick us up! We really really appreciated that.  After we left, I realized I misplaced my camera case. So I emailed the hotel on the off chance that they found it. Luckily‚Ä¶",5,,
"Good hotel, great service and staff, though somewhat overpriced",AdrianPhua,"All-round a good experience at Four Seasons Hotel Singapore. A cosy place with fantastic service standards tucked away 3-5 min walking distance from Singapore's shopping district. However, the rates were awfully high. Granted that it was during the Singapore Airshow week, but I had stubbled upon another 5 star hotel within walking distance for about 40% cheaper (and certainly not 40% less value by any standards). Nonetheless, I would still recommend the hotel to friends/family.",4,,

They know ur name and the staff will greet u , they will know what drink u had so u may like that again, they will offer etc. The look in general is classic , it was done long time ago but impeccably maintained . It's small and most of all, because if size , not chaotic , the personnel has time to manage all customers . We will definitely stay to the same again and strongly recommend it too.

decent posh hotel,mialmira,"I stayed here with my family for several times on connecting door rooms. Well, it's a posh hotel with big & clean room, very big bathroom, and very decent breakfast buffet. The bed and duvet were super lovely, the perfect remedy for our backache and tired leg after hanging around all day in Singapore. Very close to Orchard Rd., that's a very plus point for a shopping trip!  But, well..this is a posh hotel. Definitely not recommended for those who travel to Singapore with budget.",4,,
Better experience than the marina bay sands,Tania_Chris,"We loved our stay at the Four Seasons Singapore. The service was excellent-outstanding. People greeted us by name. They went out of their way to help in every way. Breakfast was brilliant (I love a buffet with fresh berries and Bircher muesli and all kinds of fruit and breads , personally, but they also had a hot buffet section with everything from Asian to American staples available and of course omelettes to order! )   3 years ago we stayed in a suite at the Marina Bay Sands and although the room was good, the service there was woeful. The Four Seasons was a beautiful contrast!   Its position close to orchard road allowed us to get coffee (I do love coffee bean and tea leaf ice blended) and snacks whenever we wanted.

Our rom was large with king size extremely comfortable bed, a lovely chair with an ottoman, a work space and a very large bathroom. The bathroom was bigger than some hotel rooms we have  occupied in Europe. It has a good size bath, tropical rain shower and double vanity.  We had breakfast and rated it as very good.

highly recommendable,Marcel S,"I am really positively surprised about this Four Seasons Hotel here in Singapore, where I am (just at the moment) for 13 nights. The infrastructure is nice, maybe not the newest one, but very much ok. The two pools are clean and not crowdy. The meeting room on the 20th floor (where we had working sessions) and the break out rooms on the third floor are very well set up. Breakfast buffet is amazing - maybe too expensive if you don't have it in a package. We also had the opening dinner and one lunch there, and the food served also was really good quality. Internet WLAN is working very well. Beside all this, what impressed me most is the service quality of all employees.

She said that it was not as comfortable as sleeping on a proper bed but she survived of course! Breakfast buffet was adequate and plentiful but seemed to lack the variety that other four seasons we have stayed at usually has.

Staff are excellent, well trained, attentive and seemed genuinely friendly and interested in providing good service.  Our room with boulevard view was quite large, updated and lacked nothing.

The manager Antoine Chahwan, after listening to us, more than made up for it!!! He  and the entire hotel staff really took special care of us for the duration of our stay.

"Great Location, Great Staff, Comfortable!",Serge G,"I've stayed at the Four Seasons before and again found it to be a wonderful place to stay.  The rooms are over-sized with terrific bathrooms, spotlessly maintained!  It's comfortable enough that one might happily decide just to remain in his room the whole day! Four Seasons is conveniently located just off Orchard Road, near all the upmarket shops at Ion and Ngee Ann City and plenty of food outlets of all categories! My only gripe is that Four Seasons charges for an internet connection.  After staying at a hotel in Myanmar with superb, free WiFi, I was let down by seeing that a 5 star operation like Four Seasons in Singapore wanted to collect change from me for that.  It's a no go these days! I recommend the hotel and recommend to the Four Seasons Singapore that they do away‚Ä¶",4,,

Wonderful start to our trip!,Katie B,"We had a wonderful stay at the Four Seasons Singapore in December 2013. The location is superb, but what really made our stay great was the staff and service.

Within minutes of getting to our room a complimentary selection of fresh juices and snacks were delivered to our room, along with a framed photo of our wedding day to celebrate our honeymoon.

Poor soundproofing of rooms,ChingHsia,"Stayed a week for business, and had disrupted sleep for the first 3 nights because it was too noisy around my room. The walls were quite thin and I could hear noises happening around my room (loud bumps, door bangings, etc). Upon complaining to the front desk (apparently I wasn't the only one who complained), they checked their CCTV and attributed the noise to one of the guests who was actively going in and out his room up until 2-3 am.

The hotel is lacking ambiance and seems more suited to a business traveller than holiday makers. The staff did, however, provide us with a beautiful cake to congratulate us, as we were visiting on our honeymoon, which was much appreciated. The breakfast is also very good.

Discovered that the hotel is near Orchard Rd, but not that close to destinations like Raffles Place, Tanjong Pagar, etc. The property was fine, as you would expect of the Four Seasons. The major annoyance for me was that at check-in, I was informed that i had been booked into a room with two twin beds, and that no rooms with king-sized beds were available. When I arrived in the room, I could see that the beds were tiny and smaller still when factoring in the oversized pillows and comforter.

When I came downstairs to check out, I let the concierge know that I wanted to take a cab, however, they didn't get me in the queue until I finished check out five minutes later.

Can't expect more,travelat70,"My girl friends and I stayed at the Four Seasons for two days. As all Four Seasons, it is well appointed and the staff are friendly and professional. the location is perfect for shopping, eating,sight-seeing, jogging and whatever you want to do. It is close to the hop-on, hop-off bus, very convenient for tourists like us. We have a premier room and is quite roomy after adding an extra bed ( which is very comfortable). I was wondering whether I should have stayed at the Marina Sands Hotel as comparing to FS. After visiting the Marina Sands, I knew I made the right decision too be at the Four Seasons. The lobby of the Marina Sands is full of tourists, groups after groups and hundreds of suitcases. I rather appreciate the elegance and peacefulness of the Four Seasons.  The water‚Ä¶",5,,
"Great Hotel, Fantastic Room, Lovely Staff",Barney70,"Stayed here recently on a three day business trip to Singapore. Have been to Singapore several times before but had not used this hotel. Very pleased I decided to stay at the Four Seasons, my room was on the 19th floor and had wonderful views of the city, extremely spacious room with a really wonderful bathroom and very powerful shower. Very clean hotel, very comfortable bed and good air con in the room to keep it at the right temperature.  Staff at the hotel were all fantastic, very helpful, friendly and always smiling. From check in to departure I was really well looked after. I will stay at this hotel on every future trip I make to Singapore. Very sad to leave such a lovely place. I picked a rate which included breakfast and a one way transfer from the airport.",5,,
Pleasant stay,shane D,"During my recent trip to Singapore I opted to stay in Four seasons mainly because of the positive reviews which I read in TA. Overall I had a very pleasant stay and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is  planning to visit Singapore.  Room I got a room in a higher floor which had a pretty nice view. The Room was quite spacious and had everything which you find in a top-notch Hotel.   Staff Staff was very attentive and will try their level best to make your stay as pleasant as they can.   Food Quality of the food was very good. However the price were quite high. But there are many food outlets/ malls within a walking distance from the Hotel, so there are plenty of options.

"Four Seasons Hotel Singapore, lovely stay & excellent service!",angelfish22_11,"My hubby surprised me with a trip to Singapore for my birthday and a chance to hook up with my best friend last October 21-24. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were met & ushered to the front desk for check-in, which took less than 5 minutes. Very efficient service to start with. We were upgraded to a couple's floor--- it was nice and quiet,  overlooking a park.  They do not disturb you until 12 noon to make up the room, unless you request for it to be made up earlier.  There is a turn down service, common with any five or six star hotel property. Little canapes are self-served during tea time. The room was spacious & kept very clean. Housekeeping was also efficient, since I had some requests for additional items. I left a note for them on the desk & at the end of the day, it was‚Ä¶",5,,

Worlds best breakfast,alan070,Have stayed here many times and this visit was as good as ever. Must have the best quality staff of any hotel I have visited. In addition the breakfast is awesome. Maybe the rooms could do with an upgrade but still large and comfortable.,5,,
Nice hotel but dated,Motoda,Service standard is typical of a Four Seasons.However the same cannot be said of its F&B outlets.It has the least amount of outstanding restaurants amongst the Four Seasons I have visited The guest rooms & facilities are also dated and in desperate need of a major overhaul for the price it is charging!,4,,
Signapore.............awesome,Sam W,"Very nice hotel!!!, so green even in the heart of town.  Service was great, very helpful.  Only draw back - nobody works the business center on Sundays and the printer didn't have any paper and i couldn't find any around the center, i also couldn't find a stapler and the computer kept dropping me off line",4,,
Great stay in Singapore,Enver B,"Staff were very friendly, room service was quick, rooms were very clean, food was good, great service overall, concierge was very helpfull. Stayed on the 16th floor view was good. The humidity level was too high, you can watch big thunderstorms from your room's window it is amazing. If you think of hiring a tour guide and private car for a reason just be careful they charge huge amount hourly based. Universal studios, Sea Aquairium, Orkid Gardens are great places to see, Must try megazip and I fly dont't forget to take the Singapore Flyer",5,,
As good as it gets,LApuplover,"Everything about the hotel was superb, especially the friendly hospitality amongst the doormen/outdoor staff.  We felt like family to some of the employees, even after only 3 days.  Nothing was too much for them, from restaurant reservations to sightseeing questions to restaurant recommendations.  Amenities are fantastic, complimentary tea/coffee/delicious danish pastries a big bonus, comfortable pool and gym amenities. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the main walking street with fancy shops such as Gucci/Prada.  It is about a 15 minute walk to the Botanical Gardens.  We loved the location, and preferred to stay in a slightly more mellow area, away from the hubbub of Clarke Quay.   Taxis are ridiculously inexpensive in Singapore, so you can get around many places‚Ä¶",5,,
Top Notch!,Donna J,"Everything is done Top Notch!  My husband and I had a wonderful experience staying here. My first trip and his one of many. He always chooses to stay here when traveling to Singapore. It is a beautiful hotel and it gives you a very calm and quiet stay. The staff is very helpful and treats you with utmost respect. Breakfast has all that you would want and very yummy! The restaurant serves the most amazing dish Crispy Aromatic Duck. It is roasted and shredded served on thin white pancake with plum sauce, thin sticks of spring onion and cucumber. It is like a duck fajita. I am not a huge fan of any other duck choices but this is Delicious!  The location is great, close to Orchard street shopping, just a hop skip and jump away.",5,,
Expensive,Graham S,"Nice decor and lovely room but at $500 a night I'd expect breakfast and wifi as standard. Amazing that a hotel aiming at this standard should adopt a 'Ryan Air' approach to everything other than just sleeping. My advice: stay here if you like the location, but don't eat, drink, or use the internet. Chiseling isn't the word ",3,,
super stay in Singapore,margriet l,"great service, very friendly staff, wonderful food and very flexible!! We had great rooms and the view was spectacular, especially because there was a huge thunderstorm and that is an amazing thing to watch from the 17th floor!!! Orcard Road is fun.",5,,

From the efficient ,friendly pickup by the hotel limo at the airport to our return we had fabulous service. All the staff were friendly and often had jokey banter with my children. The restaurant breakfasts were great and to suit a wide variety of tastes and although we dined out mainly the dinner was excellent when we ate in. Singapore is not a cheap city and the hotel is at the luxury end of the market and its pricing reflects this.",4,,

It's not same level as other Four Seasons,Lee1306,"It was generally ok. But I don't think this Four Seasons provides the same kind of 5 star service as other Four Seasons.   My parents visited me in SIngapore and they stayed 4 nights at Four Seasons. I stayed with them two nights so we got a fairly big room and ordered roller bed instead of two rooms. Our room had connecting door which we didn't mind. But on last day, it seemed like some wedding guests were staying in next room and they were having a party. They played stereo music really loud, and talked really loud as if there were 10 people screaming at each other. And I could hear all their conversation through the connecting door. We told hotel manager about it and asked them to move the wedding guest to the other room. I told them I understand that they are celebrating‚Ä¶",3,,
This is a great hotel,Melissa Downes,"We loved this hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. My husband left and we all shared a room, no problem. Breakfast buffet missed, have it take away on the way to the airport. They were fantastic. The rooms were a good size and three minutes from Orchard Rd.  My one gripe could be that that the pool lady was a bit over efficient and not that nice to the children - I felt like we were an intrusion on her territory. Food and drinks were expensive with a pool side lunch for three (two meals being kids small ones) and three drinks costing $96 SNG but I am starting to think that's just standard for a five star property.  We loved the rasberries on the breakfast buffet and the beds were super comfortable.",5,,

Breakfast and dinner in the restaurant were excellent.  The staff were extremely accommodating.

Excellent,Maria T,From the moment of our arrival all the management team was very attentive to us and service they produced was impeccable. Suite is very comfortable.

"Good rooms, expensive services..",MisterSkyBlue,"While I went for a business trip to Singapore, this hotel kind of came across as more off-business kinds. It is located in a fairly quiet location on the Orchard Road. Pretty and clean rooms. However, laundry is a serious rip-off - I reiterate this - it is very expensive! Other than that, it was good. Breakfast spread was alright - cold cuts were quite less and cold breakfast range was small.",3,,
"Very good, not excellent",192sporting,"I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel though my previous experiences at Four Seasons in other countries was better. There are at least 2-3 top-quality hotels in Singapore that offer higher 5-star quality standards. For example, the pools (there are 2) are less luxurious and attractive to spend time around than I had expected. The dining experience is also quite limited. In my opinion: very good hotel but not good enough for the Four Seasons quality label. The bar next to the breakfast/dining area is nice and has all you need in terms of food and drinks. Service was very good throughout the hotel and the room was also very good quality and size.",4,,
An amazing stay..,gj23,"This is a great hotel with everything you would expect of a Four Seasons hotel. First impressions were great. We arrived very early on a Sunday morning and our room was understandably not ready but without any hesitation we were shown to another room in the hotel so we could have a rest and freshen up after our long  trip. Our deluxe room was on the couples floor(this has extra perks such as late house keeping, no children on that floor and lovely touches like a book of ‚Äò101 things to do as a couple in Singapore‚Äô). The room has everything you could need and of course the amazing Four Seasons bed! The staff were attentive and friendly throughout. The Sunday buffet at One-Ninety is also amazing.

The hotel is immaculate with fresh flowers everywhere. The rooms looked like expected in a luxury hotel and very clean and the bed is so comfortable I did not want to return to my mattress at home. Only surprise was the cost of breakfast. The buffet cost SGC$42.00 and that was more than I expected to pay. We had a 1:45 AM flight so instead of having to pay for another day, the hotel let us have a 3:00 pm check out and then hang out at the spa where it is nice to get a shower and freshen up before a long over night flight.

The afternoon tea is something we would highly recommend to try, we never miss it.

Please, notice that on our second visit we came with my parents and a couple of good friends of ours. They all were completely overwhelmed by the perfection of the service provided by Four Seasons Hotel Singapore. I will say again that this is the most elegant hotel in Singapore, everything is so beautifully appointed that one would just hope to live there. But what makes really the difference between Four Seasons Singapore and all the other 5 star hotels is service. What we experienced at Four Seasons Singapore was not only the most perfect, attentive, exquisite, luxurious service‚Ä¶",5,,
Wonderful experience,RobertZ813,"Stayed 4 nights in August. Room excellent, and bed was the best I have ever had in a hotel. Staff very helpful and friendly. Concierge found a discount to the Aquarium, booked tickets and printed them out, saving us much time in line! Only small issue was the high cost of breakfast. But would stay here again without question and would recommend this property.",5,,
Bad Experience for a Luxurious City.,99Babak,I was surprised of such a Hotel in Singapore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rooms has insects we inform reception they tried to sort it out but no use. ambitious was not for a luxurious city like Singapore. I used to live in Grand Hyatt in Singapore before there were different experience.,2,,
Nothing Too Much Trouble,Reegan S,"My family of 5 recently stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel.  Nothing was too much trouble.  The staff were extremely helpful, the rooms were in excellent condition, the gym and tennis courts well maintained.  From the complimentary tea/coffee and pastries each morning to the turn down service each night, everything was five star.  We would definitely come back and stay at this hotel again.  The staff should be complimented on the level of service they provided.",5,,
Great place to stay,Alexkaikeong,"I stayed for four nights at Four Seasons Hotel. The attention, needs and detail were indeed very well taken care of. When we were on the first night, I decided to book another three more nights in this hotel on the Executive Suite. It really make me feel so comfortable.",5,,
never ending check in,jb8765,"when you enter the hotel immediately you see all the staff trying to make themselves look busy.  we used to come to four seasons because they have a special welcome for kids. they anything but ignored them.  we had a reservation, parents and 3 kids in 2 rooms. we tried to check in into 2 rooms, but they could not find reasonable rooms for us to stay. it took them like couple of hours of asking us to wait while they are working in the computer ""moving other guests"" to finally offer rooms near by.  the location is not so good if you want to walk out to orchard (not to far but requires some walking). they are on orchard blvd while you want to go to orchard Rd.  eventually after 2 hours of trying to check in, we just walked away.",2,,
A perfect stay,AngelinaAustralia,"We stayed recently for 4 nights and, whilst we didn't have breakfast (at $45 a head!), we thought the room was excellent value (four nights, pay for 3) and the service was really lovely. I had to ask three different staff at the concierge counter for assistance with a broken watch, a missing stone from my ring and recommendations for restaurants and they were more then helpful, going well beyond their remit. The bed was amazingly comfortable - like a cloud! - and the location perfect for access to shopping, coffee/breakfast places and the Botanical Gardens. Would definitely return.",5,,
First visit to Four Seasons Hotel and hugely impressed!,Steve K,"We were taking a family vacation to Singapore and booked on the 4 nights for 3 deal. From initial booking enquiry to our final departure we were given first class service and quality. I had spoken to a number of hotels for a room booking, and managed to strike a deal with Four Seasons to get cot bed and breakfast included in the room rate for a corner suite. Check in was flawless and we were taken to out expansive room. During our stay we noticed that there was a loud noise coming from behind the wall in the bedroom. We contacted the front desk, and Charles the front desk manager took personal responsibility for following up. This is what set the Four Seasons apart from other hotels. Charles made sure they found out the problem, resolved it by closing the adjacent room and then‚Ä¶",5,,
Classy,J H,"Excellent warm service with attention to details. Rooms were impeccable. We received two connecting, large rooms for us and our children. We stayed twice in August, second stay was even better, as they started to know us. Kids were welcomed by their names, lots of little details and attention, this four season is classy and made us feel like home. Great pools and tennis courts, one even air conditioned! Will definitely return again!",5,,
Simply fantastic,Tom C,"Hard to know where to begin.  We spent four nights recently and it was a bit of a splurge for us.  My wife and I and our two girls aged 11 and four.  As we entered the lobby my littlest looked up at me and said, ""It smells like raisins!""  A cute observation that we shared with Sachi at reception who checked us in.  Sachi was a thorough professional who took a little extra time to talk to my wife and girls who are also Japanese.  She provided two light mesh backpacks to the girls and sent us on our way.  The room was like new and we marveled at the view of Singapore from the 17th floor.  The pool is on the 20th floor and we spent time there each day during the visit.  It is small, but never crowded and we had the place to ourselves a couple of afternoons.  Ronald was particularly‚Ä¶",5,,
Typical Four Seasons,GOAL_Spring,"I stayed in this hotel for a couple of times. The things I like about this hotel:  The bed is extremely comfortable. The rooms are of good size and are beautifully decorated. The services are very good. The staff are friendly and helpful. They do extra to enhance guests satisfaction. The environment is quiet and beautiful. The things I less like: although  it is close or Orchard Road and the shopping area but it is far away from the financial/business center, less convenient for business travelers. It is also farther away from the airport than hotels in Marina Bay. The hotel does not provide tooth brushes and combs - make sure you bring your own.",4,,
excellent location for long stay,RamiW,Stayed at the hotel for 12 days. Excellent service and great location. Hotel staff is ready to assist at anytime about anything . Nice Gym and the Spa service was outstanding. Great breakfast for jet-legged guests.,5,,
Very Nice Property - They Take Care of You,William G,"I had a 3.5 night stay earlier this month.  I arrived at ~3:00 a.m. on the SQ flight from LAX/NRT. I was able to pay a 50% rate for the first night due to my later arrival so I had a place to rest my head when I got there,, and then I paid the regular rate for the next three nights. I went through a Virtuoso agent, so some amenities (E.g., daily breakfast, US $100 food and beverage credit during the stay, room upgrade) were included.  THINGS I LOVED:  The hotel itself is very clean, nicely decorated but not on the sleek or modern side. It's rather opulent, to be frank about it, but very much like a ""typical"" Four Seasons. I've seen some of the comments about it feeling ""dated"" but I tend to disagree, at least for the room I had.  Check in was quick and painless. The man who‚Ä¶",4,,
Home away from home,Mats F,"We have stayed here a number of times the last 10-15 years and for us it really feels like home away from home. A great feeling. We just like the overall friendly and club like atmosphere.  The location is perfect with a few minutes walk to the Orchard/Scott crossing with all the shopping, eating and MRT subway station. I've read reviews that pointed out that the walk to Orchard is too long, but I don't understand that. It is a very short walk.  The breakfast buffet is great, staff have always been very friendly and helpful, the massage sessions at the Spa have always been very good, we like just sitting at the bar (inside or outside) in the evenings.   We haven't really used the concierge desk that much - Singapore is very easy to get around by yourself and I can't think of any‚Ä¶",5,,
Awesome staff at Four Seasons,Harpreet B,"First stay at the four seasons in Singapore last week. the service by far is the best service i have received, the staff at the reception is very very helpful and so is the housekeeping staff. thank you all.",5,,
"Great location, excellent service and luxury room!",Tripper4007,"Highly recommended....ticked all the boxes and will definitely be returning. Shout-out to the gentleman from concierge who went to a lot of trouble to locate my missing prescription glasses - he reviewed video footage to find out the taxi number, called the taxi company and found out that the driver had handed them into reception at the office building that I had gone to that morning. I got my glasses back and am extremely grateful.",5,,
Relaxing place,AdrianMayChee,The hotel is in a good location being just walking distance from Orchard MRT station and set among some wonderful foliage.  The concierge was very good in helping with a query about a purchase from the children's department in Takashimaya.  The decor creates an old world charm (minimalists need not apply) and there is a wonderful study next to the reception which is excellent for reading or just reflecting.,4,,
The best service,tokyo890,"First stay at the Four Seasons chain in Singapore last week,  we stayed in a executive suite the room was a little dated but very clean.  The service by far is the best service I have received, the staff went out of there way to make my 5 year old something that wasn't on the in room dining menu and the concierge desk booked all our tickets for universal and the night safari, the door staff were attentive and polite every member of staff we met were genuine, helpful and polite.  Looking forward to trying another four seasons hotel.  The Chauhan Family",5,,
Good stay,savvyrai,Convenient location.  Good rooms and room service. I was on the 14th Floor and the view was excellent. It was also a pool facing room.  The buffet was good. Wide variety of dishes and options.  Over all good experience.,4,,
excellent service,Kbt22,"we just came back from singapore and stayed at the FS during our 5 day holiday in SG. Check in was easy and the receptionist was very helpful, she also showed us to our room and gave us a map of singapore and suggested romantic things to do (as this stay was for our anniversary), she greeted us a happy anniversary and showed us the anniversary cake and flowers they have prepared for us which was a lovely touch. the  room was spacious with a lovely view of the city skyline (as we suggested) we can even see a bit of the marina bay sands which means we can see glimpses of the laser/light show at night. all staff were very helpful and has given us amazing service and always go out of there way to help.

A typical four seasons hotel. Very good overall.,justine,"I stayed here with 3 family members in July. We picked this hotel based on the good reviews on TripAdvisor, and that they were doing a fourth night free promotion.   The hotel is very beautiful and grand, which is pretty much what I expected from a four season hotel. The check-in was smooth and pleasant. Our room was a little more spacious than I expected. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room was nice, but it didn't stand out from any other five star hotel rooms I have stayed in. The internet wasn't cheap and the connection was both unstable and slow. After we complained to the front desk, they were nice enough to install a router in our room which solved any internet problems we had.   I went to the club to use their sauna and steam room facility. The change room area‚Ä¶",4,,
An outstanding experience,Naruto7860,Just checking out after 5 fantatsic days rounding off a perfect family vacation. Zoltan (reception manager) and the team did a great job from the moment we arrived to departure. A fabulous suite on arrival with extra beds in palce for the kids (7 and 10 yr old daughters). Location is excellent! Transporatation no issue. ION shopping mall and other shops very close with a link through to Orchard road via connection with adjacent Hilton. Family pool on roof top is great! Fitness suite and spa not to be missed.Great location to expolore this wonderful city state.We will be back!,5,,
Classic Four Seaons - Service excellent.,stumack,This maintains the expected standard.  Extremely high service.  Everyone knows your name when you check in and need anything.  Good location. Easy walk to the botanical gardens and cab ride to other locations.  a very good stop on your trip through the far east.,4,,
I'm in two minds about the Four Seasons Singapore,sodesa,"On the one hand, there is this discreet refined luxury and attentive, unobtrusive service throughout consistent with the brand. The corner room I got was bright and spacious with fine views; and the gym and spa facilities were well equipped spread over two levels. There is also a ""Living Room"" off the Lobby, as a place for informal meetings or work. The preponderance of art pieces throughout the public spaces makes this Hotel stand out  However what detracted from my stay were the following:the absence of free wifi in any of the public areas, and more importantly the poor and erratic connectivity especially in the rooms; the underwhelming ground floor entrance; the dark somber interiors; and the fringe location making it less convenient than many other hotels.  One other‚Ä¶",3,,
Losing its shine,HongKongPatrick,"I used to book in the Four Seasons in Singapore for almost 15 years. I will not come back. This time I booked a ""week end"""" special offer ( of course most of visitors are business people booking during the week only) in excess of 500 SGD per night for an upscale room. Very big room indeed but nothing special otherwise with a small window with a view on the city. In the week end offer no Wifi included. You have to add 50 SGD to have it for the two days of the week end. ( when are deluxe hotels like 4S going to understand that we dont expect to pay for the internet when we leave more than 1,400 SGD for two days on their desk? In which world are they Living?) No Breakfast included too, 97 SGD for two per day for a reasonable but not particularly great buffet to be added on the top‚Ä¶",3,,
Wonderful Hotel,Jerry C,"I got to stay at the Four Seasons Singapore while there on business last week.  It is a beautiful hotel with a wonderful atmosphere and great service.  My room was lovely.     The staff was fantastic even by the very high Four Seasons standards-- friendly, warm and helpful.   I had lunch at the restaurant in the lobby and it was really nice and the food was excellent.    The hotel is a bit of an oasis in a bustling city.  I will definitely stay here again on my next visit to Singapore.  I wished I had a chance to stay longer-- I didn't want to leave.",5,,
Excellent service makes the hotel outstanding,Hang T,"I stayed Four Seasons Hotel and Resort Singapore for 8 nites with family and would say excellent service makes the hotel oustanding.  From house keeping (Thank you, Mrs. Tien Sing, for your attentive care to my family during our stay in FS) in-room dining to club service, staffs are very professional, willing to help.   We enjoyed the room, tennis courts and great location of the hotel. Nice and quiet up-hill surroundings though just a short stroll to shopping areas. There's also a jogging path outside the hotel up to Botanic Garden.  Not so impressed with the Chinese restaurant on 2nd fl. We liked room service and One-Ninety much more.",5,,
great father's day weekend,achang2639,"took the family to Singapore for a weekend, the hotel was exceptional.  They prepared a personalized snacks for the kids on Sunday and the room and the sunday brunch is to die for.

8 out of 10,TBGH,"Stayed 2 Nights  The rooms are most comfortable ,extremely quiet and very well appointed. Bed is very comfortable ,bathrooms are large , luxurious .  The pool is on the roof and is extremely basic not where you would want to relax and spend a quiet afternoon. The setting is not appealing ,the pool is small and you are just sitting on concrete roof.  Breakfast is good but not great ,the selection is ok but not what I would expect from Four Seasons. We did eat 1 night in the restaurant and found the food to be outstanding and we thoroughly enjoyed it . The service throughout the hotel is excellent with the exception of the concierge . We arrived from a cruise and had unfortunately lost a bag on our arrival in Singapore and asked the concierge to help us in locating it. He told us‚Ä¶",4,,
Great location...luxurious hotel,Gauravmerchant,We booked four seasons based on trip advisors rating. It was excellent great location superb property.

This is the 5th year we are booking based on trip advisors reviews perfect suggestions. We will continue to use trip advisor for all our future trips.,5,,
Nostalgia of colonial days,Epicurius_at_large,"It's been 10 years since my last visit to this property. It underwent significant renovation, but preserved the essence of colonial style. The lobby and cafe whisper quiet luxury, in contrast to many modern hotels which scream ""new wealth"".   The premier room is sizeable, though sparsely decorated, it is equipped with a double closet with plenty of storage space. Bathroom is very spacious with separate toilet compartment. It is lined with pink marble which brings back memories of a Roman palazzo.   Four Seasons is at the heart of the busiest shopping district in Singapore. Just minutes of walk away from Orchard Road and Scotts Road, which boast giant malls such as ION, Takashimaya and Paragon.   Hotel service is typical Four Seasons standard. In a word - excellent.",5,,

I had my tourist book and map to figure sightseeing. The waitress took notice and offered his help. He also recommended  Level 33 lounge that has the best view of the bay and went out of his way to print name and address of this bar.

Overall we had a wonderful trip!",5,,
Amazing Service,Bob B,"A short 3 night stay on the way back to Australia, this hotel was fantastic, the service was the best I have ever received, for a large hotel and used mainly for business (I guess) the focus they put on ensuring that the family and children were well catered for was great, from books and toys when we arrived to jelly and drinks in the room as we walked through the door. A well thought out and welcoming experience.",5,,
246 DOLLARS FOR A SHOWER,Bill J,"This is an excellent hotel in the city of Singapore. Why were we disappointed? Having spent over four thousand Singapore dollars with this hotel in six days we were quoted 246 Singapore dollars for a late check out.

Great Hotel with minor flaws,Legaldds,"This hotel is located within walking distance to the heart of shopping. The indoor walkway to Hilton Hotel, offers a short cut to Orchard Road which is the heart of the action.  Singapore Airlines has a hop on hop off bus which has an stop directly across the street from the hotel. While I am usually not a big fan of those buses, in Singapore the air conditioned bus was a very good option.   Hotel room was a typical four seasons. Meticulous with great beds and nice bathroom. Generally, the staff were very professional and helpful. However, my biggest and perhaps lone complain was how they treated the American Express Platinum bookings. During check in we were offered a room upgrade for S$120 a night, which we accepted while knowing that upgrades, if available which obviously‚Ä¶",4,,

Check-in was very quick (my family arrived a few days earlier) and pleasant as always. Interconnecting rooms on a low floor. Little bit of a city view but nothing special. Well appointed rooms, with great big bathrooms. Bed comfy and a nice TV too. Would agree that they are a bit tired though, and probably in need of a refurb. On the third day the room was quite smoky (i guess a guest smoking below us). With a baby we said we couldn't stay, and they immediately moved us to another floor and without any fuss. Kudos.  Our rate was good considering it was a FS, but we had no breakfast. Mistake. It was outrageously expensive and i have to say overall it was quite disappointing. Certainly not up‚Ä¶",4,,
Great Service but Hotel Needs a Facelift,paris s,"Following the tradition of Four Seasons Hotel, we had no complaint regarding the service and attention to detail.

Welcoming,Christine V V,"The Four Seasons was a wonderful experience.  I had to go to Singapore unexpectedly on a family matter , there were 5 of us travelling. Normally this hotel would have been out of my price range , but somehow we got unexpectedly good rates! The staff were very attentive at all times. My only criticism they may have been too over zealous when clearing plates, before everyone had finished eating. The Interiors were tasteful and seating areas comfortable.The bedrooms and bathrooms spacious and luxurious with lovely additions as in L'Occitane soaps and creams and herbal teas. We had an early check out time, I was impressed that they had Teas, Coffee and small pastries laid out at such an early hour.",4,,

Pros: - Excellent location. - Super, super comfortable beds and spacious rooms.  Separate shower and bath, 2 sinks and even a bidet.  - Service was generally good and definitely well intentioned but could still use some work.  Doormen greeted me by name during my entire stay and room service etc was prompt. - Well-equipped gym.  Certainly better than the St Regis and I would say above average for most hotels.

The One Ninety Restaurant was superb. The venue had lovely decor and ambiance, and the service was very polished. They handled my gluten free diet restrictions very smoothly (which can be quite a challenge in Singapore) - there was a gluten free menu already prepared, and on our second visit they also served GF bread which was quite a treat.

My New Favorite Hotel in Singapore,TuanBesar69,"I've been going to Singapore for 50 years staying in the 60s at the Cathay and the Goodwood Park. Started going back in the 90s and stayed first at the Intercontinental, then the Ritz-Carlton and, for the last several years, the St. Regis. This time I stayed for 7 days at the Four Seasons and couldn't have been happier. The location, one block from Orchard Road, was convenient but quiet. As a swimmer, I really liked their having two pools: one for families and one for lap swimmers The upgraded room was very spacious with a nice view. The gym was excellent. Had a very good massage by a real Balinese masseuse. Was able to have peaceful extended meetings in the 2nd floor lounge. Loved the breakfast buffet. One of the best ever. Hotel staff couldn't have been nicer.",5,,

Kind and helpful service from reception,Lucinda T,"I have recently returned from a three night weekend at the Four Seasons Singapore with my teenage daughters. While we did have some issues, what was impressive was the way in which they were dealt with by Reception, and in particular, Zolton the Reception Manager. Inevitably, travel overseas can occasionally involve some anxieties, especially when traveling alone with children, but I was impressed with the thoughfulness and individual concern that my children and I were given. Unquestionally the hotel's faclities are beautiful and the housekeeping outstanding, however, it is the personal service and kindess from staff like Zolton, that we will remember.",5,,
"Had a very short stay in Singapore (2 nights), but it was very nice! Exactly what you expect from a Four Seasons!",Alocin293928,"Very good stay at the Four Seasons Singapore, the beds are fantastic!

Just a shame that they were not able to prepare a proper Old Fashioned at the bar (they put it in a shaker)! Ended up drinking Negroni's in stead.",5,,
Top-Notch service and staffs from Four Seasons,Soitsme,"Very impressed with four season's staffs and their professionalism.

Large and comfy,Frankiej_007,"A wonderful room with excellent staff and service.  You know when a Hotel lists that they have a gym...and you walk in to find a couple of weights, a treadmill and not much else? Well not here at the Four Seasons! Was very well equiped with free weights, weight machines and a number of treadmills and cross-trainers. Even at peak time in the morning, you have the space and eqieipment you wanted. Free use of towels and free bottled water. No excuses not to get your pump on or work up a sweat.  As for the rooms, perfect. Spotless with every detail taken care of...even a turndown service.  All the staff were friendly and egar to make sure we were taken care of.  Would I stay there again - YES!",5,,
A couple's massage at off-peak gets you 30 minutes more!,Haamid J,"The promo to avail 30 minutes extra with your regular therapy during off peak hours was worth it all.  The therapists, professional to the core giving their best for 90 minutes put me at least to sleep with great pampering.",5,,

Great hotel in Singapore,DQCONE,Four Season hotels are great because of the staff and this hotel was great!  At least 3 people knew our names by the end of the first day.  You truly feel like you are in a club when you stay with Four Seasons.  Shopping is walking distance to one of the biggest malls in Singapore.  A cab ride to the new sands casino is on $10 and worth to see.,5,,
Hotel for All Seasons,j_herliani,"After doing much research and comparing the different hotels in Singapore, we have decided to book Four Seasons' Premier Room for a 5 night stay.   Location: Strategically located just outside the main stretch of Orchard Road - paradise for shopaholics, the hotel is of walking distance to Orchard MRT and several shopping malls in the area. In addition, buses are readily available to bring us to most of the cities' attractions which provides added convenience especially for tourists.   Check-In/Check-Out: Upon arriving at the hotel, we were well greeted by the concierge as well as FO staff. Both check-in/check-out was done swiftly and rooms were available immediately since we arrived at 3pm - standard check-in time for the hotel. Was impressed with the interior of the lobby‚Ä¶",4,,
For business or pleasure a great place in Singapore.......,OGBangkok,"I was in Singapore for a meeting. Just over 24 hours, but the staff at the hotel were friendly and accomodating. The gentlemen at the door or the ladies at the Front Desk, always a pleasant smile and a wonderful attitude. The hotel was very busy with a dignatary from a European country, security, lots of people, ploce escorts, etc, but still they managed to make us all feel welcome. Many hotels failed to find the balance between looking after a VIP and the 'rest of the world"" not this hotel....well done",5,,
Refinement and Service Par Excellence,SusanL423,"Absolutely cannot fault this hotel during our short stay.  Our expectations were exceeded in every respect from the moment we checked in to the moment we departed. That was when the Doorman inquired which airline we were flying with, and was able to direct the taxi driver to take us to a particular terminal drawing on his own knowledge of the airport. We were impressed. The room was beautifully furnished and service superb, with the shower the best we have experienced. A potted orchid in the bathroom was a nice touch. We have yet to encounter another centrally located hotel in a major city being able to boast not one but several tennis courts. FS Singapore is what every 5 star hotel should aspire to be. Well done!",5,,
Excellent Luxury Family Hotel,Todd K,"High-end luxury hotels who really look after your children are hard to come by, but Four Seasons Singapore tops the list for us. They spoilt the kids with sensational welcome gifts, the kids room was heavily discounted and they supply children's amenities. But above all, the staff love kids and it really shows. Other luxury hotels rather not deal with kids, Four Seasons Singapore is different and they make the kids feel more spoilt than the adults :) Also, the rooms are one and a half times the size of regular hotel rooms which makes for a very comfortable stay with children.",5,,
"Wow,  really ticked all my boxes.",GurusWüç∑üç§,"Until now my favourite place to stay in Singapore was the Valley Wing.  However, a friend suggested FS due to its excellent location and that she thought it would be just right for me.  How true!  I arrived very late after a severely delayed flight and the doorman met me by name. Check in was seamless and within no time at all I was sound asleep in my heavenly bed on the couples floor (and yes I was alone, but I appreciated the child free haven)  I slept late, unusual for me and this continued for the next few days.  To normal review format:  Room:  Good view with lots of greenery and not into another building.  Plenty of space, great bathroom, I even indulged in a long slow bath.  Everything you'd expect from a FS (I have a few FS under the belt) I never once saw housekeeping‚Ä¶",5,,
"Staff has a ""must do ""attitude",evantorch,"We have stayed in many Four Seasons Hotels. Too often, the staff at them confuses snide pretentiousness for true hospitality; however in this case, the Four Seasons in Singapore hits things dead center. I asked for a room with an excellent city view and had a gorgeous one indeed. Breakfast was included and outstanding. Best shops on Orchard Rd. are a few steps away.",5,,
Lovely hotel with very good customer service,RL_YL,"Stayed here 3 nights for a conference.  The service staff at the reception during check-in was really good. It is nice to be greeted by name. Rooms are clean and comfortable. I think we were in the deluxe room, but it felt really spacious. I think the layout, decor and space planning were well done. Housekeeping does a wonderful job too.  Meetings were held at the ballroom, staff were attentive, quick to respond and helpful. Meals were served at the ballroom occasionally and were alright. But the desserts were really, really delicious!!! Hotel is a short walk away from shopping malls, and tucked away in a quieter spot. There's a pedestrian pathway leading to Wheelock but beware of cyclists! They're not supposed to be cycling there (but not everyone follows rules), so please be‚Ä¶",5,,

"Outstanding, attentive service!  Completely exceeded our expectations",sparoz,"We stayed at the Executive Suite for 10 nights in this great hotel. The service was outstanding and have exceeded our expectations.  We found the staff genuine, friendly and always trying to make our stay memorable.  Where do I start?  - Bell desk and doorman gives you the warmest greetings every time.  We often go through the Hilton entrance on the other side and the difference was night and day  - Checkin was efficient, welcoming, ensuring we know the features of our room, letting us know they are always there to help, giving us a great start to our stay  - Concierge was helpful and always try their best to fullfil our request without us even asking, ringing multiple locations to try to secure us a table on some busy nights  - Pool staff provided some of the most exceptional‚Ä¶",5,,
Not bad but not the best either.,Idrila I,"Mention Four Seasons and I'm sure you already have your own set of expectations that comes with it. I was however somewhat disappointed with the experience.   The hotel is strategically located on Orchard Road, the shopping mecca in the heart of Singapore. It takes about 5 minutes away from Ion Shopping Centre and endless shopping malls beyond that. So for that I give it 5 out of 5.  But once inside the Four Seasons, I felt nothing special. The interior setting is designed with a modern minimalist concept, perhaps too minimal for Four Seasons standard. The combination of modern and oriental elements from tigers to Chinese dynasty vases, antiques, etc did not bode well, in fact it showcases too much of oriental influences that one might have thought he was in China instead of the‚Ä¶",3,,
Four Seasons? Impressed but....,calvenracquel,"I can't recall if I ever stayed at Four Seasons when I was lots younger, well, so let's make this was my first Four Seasons experience then.... I always heard lots of compliments bout FS, esp. for my ex-partner who has been staying numbers of FS in the world. Due to his early time in Singapore, he was staying there for a month before the company confirmed his contract to full-time instead just ""helping"" the Singapore site. And before end of the contract, the company put him stay at FS again (bout 2 years later) for another month before they sent him back to US. So here you go with my review.  According to him, FS is fantastic with room, hospitality and greetings and so... That's what I thought too. FS should be in very high standard, or I should exclusive standard compared to so‚Ä¶",4,,
Excellent,Hairloos30,"Lovely welcome including gift for our 2 1/2 year old daughter. We stayed in a suite and they had set it up with an extra bed in the lounge area. For families I would recommend a suite as it is huge, has 2 bathrooms, dining area and enough space to spread out. Breakfast was huge and a great selection - it does get busy but they have plenty of space. Swimming pool was nice with some toys for children and an excellent view over the city. Only surprise was the price of dry cleaning but this is a business hotel I suppose. Whilst the hotel was busy & aimed more at the business traveller we were made to feel welcome at all times and they could not have done more to make our stay any better as a family.",5,,
A good as ever,Brad_Lizzie,"There were some mediocre reviews of this hotel on this site that nearly put us off booking, despite the fact that we regularly stay at Four Seasons hotels around the world and are part of their ""By Invitation"" loyalty programme. In fact the suite that they gave us was fabulous, and the service every bit as good as at any other if their hotels. It is well positioned right by Orchard Road and the subway station, and I would not hesitate to recommend it for a holiday or business stay in this rapidly developing city.",5,,
The usual excellent four seasons experience,ziggy b,"Four Seasons has lived up to my expectations-consistent high level service, beginning with the limo driver and carrying right on to bell desk, doorman, front desk, room servicing staff, pool staff, workout room staff, restaurant staff and on and on. Always delivering five star service!",5,,
Great location and excellent service.,Mars B,The Four Seasons in Singapore is located a 2 minute walk from Orchard Road and also very close to the Botanics. The welcome from service was good and was very surprised at the size of the room and bathroom - both very large.

Absolutely faultless,David B,"Their service, room and facilities were superb. Steam room was amazing, check in was so accommodating at a pretty good price. Compared to my poor experience a few nights earlier at the Sheraton this was at the opposite end of the scale.",5,,
Top choice,roadwarrior30,"TOP RECOMMENDATION: This is the Four Seasons and the experience you get is their brand no matter where in the world you happen in. Singapore is no different. There is no detail too small for the management not to give consideration to.  The staff is trained, retrained and told again. They are friendly but not familiar, Anticipating but not obtrusive. Sitting in shorts, with a holey polo shirt in the lobby, they have no idea if you're the CEO of a major corporation or simply someone who dresses poorly. They default to assuming you're the CEO. Service could not be better.  My king room was huge, quiet, elegant and everything carefully thought out as to my needs. I have no doubt Four Seasons thought about the sound the light switch made when touched. Yes the beds are a tad soft,‚Ä¶",5,,

Worst Four Seasons I've been to,Int_herald,"Non-smoking suite room I was checked into reeked of cigarettes so badly that the staff who showed me in agreed to change rooms. However, the new room didn't smell any better but on the pretext that the ""hotel was full"" (it didn't seem like it as the breakfast restaurant was half empty), they refused further accommodation. They did bring in an ionizer, although it only made the room smell funnier. At bedtime we found out the window curtains were broken so we had to call for an electrician and after he left, quite randomly staff barged in to take back the ionizer...at that point it was past 10 pm and we had a child already in bed, scared at all the comings and goings. Staff at the restaurant were so slow and inattentive that they did not even fill our water glasses, forgot our‚Ä¶",2,,
Not up to expectation,Luanne,"The room was a little aged, with sign of ageing especially in the bathroom. I didn't like the bathroom, with solid dark green marble - it felt like a modern sacrophagus! The bed was WAY too soft - so soft that I got a backache sleeping on it! Also, a toothbrush set doesn't come with the room and had to be specially requested. I was trying to order room service, and the menu was nowhere to be found. When my clam chowder arrived it was extremely disappointing - I think any tinned clam chowder would have tasted better! The lobby is also very poky. Didn't really like the place, especially for the price. ",4,,
Beautiful elegant hotel with fantastic service,rarchy,"This is such a beautiful hotel with wonderful service. Every part of the hotel looks classy and luxurious.

Lots of room to move about and work if necessary, and everything looked elegant and classy.  The bathroom huge, with 2 sinks, bath and large walk in shower. The usual L'Occitane toiletries are supplier.   I had lunch in the buffet restaurant which was very good, and breakfast too was nice.   There was a lot of restaurants in the area, and easy to get the tourist day bus if you want to do some sightseeing.   It is pricey but that is what you expect for a luxury 5* and you certainly get what you pay for.",5,,

Spotless with service to match,Chrissy S,"My daughter and I stayed at this glorious hotel for 6 nights while we enjoyed Singapore.  If you love classic, opulent, and elegant good taste as far as interiors go, you will not be dissapointed.  Service is exceptional, and goes past the word ""regular"".

I lost my credit card while standing at the reception counter in the process of checking out.  If this sounds ridiculous, it's amazing how simply things get lost.

Bathrooms are very generous in size, have every amenity, lots of light and quality towelling. I find the staff to be very friendly, welcoming and professional.  The restaurant is small but as Singapore is known for its' vast number of excellent restaurants and taxi's are so cheap that it's worth catching one to get to restaurants a bit further afield, we only used the hotel restaurant for catching up with friends over a drink or two.

Worst Four Seasons Ever,travelnowJackson_WY,"My family and I regularly stay at Four Seasons all over the world and the one in Singapore is easily the worst that we have ever experienced.  The staff is inadequately trained and, worst yet, the management, when push comes to shove, not service-oriented whatsoever.  Here is a brief litany of why we were so dissatisfied with this hotel:  - Inadequate dining.  They have essentially a coffee shop (the 190) and a small Chinese restaurant here.  They are not guest-oriented enough to hold back a few tables for hotel guests.  Consequently, there is a good likelihood that you will be sent packing if you try to walk-in for a meal.

"Great location, amidst greens yet close to Orchard",myDen7,Close to the shopping district (Orchard) yet amidst peaceful greens. I recommend this for couples or holidaying visitors. Getting to business district isn't a stone throw away and better hotel choices are available around CBD.   Hotel is a couple of bus stops from Botanical garden and nearby lots of food choices. Orchard offers multiple choices for exploring night life and clubs (hotels). Be careful at bargain stores around Far east plaza (they aren't totally honest often).,4,,
Disapointing and overrated,SabaiMorLam,"On arrival at the hotel, check in was fairly painless and took around 5 minutes. The room itself was reasonable but lacked attention to detail e.g. the HDMI port on the TV didn't work, the shower tap was so stiff to turn, you needed to find an implement to thump it with. Housekeeping was also lackluster and cleaning was not thorough particularly in the bathroom. They also place 2 bottles of water by the TV with a label that they cost I think 10SGD, anyway being thirsty I opened this although was pretty angry that at the room rate they charged for drinking water, it wasn't until I returned to my room in the evening and went to the bathroom that I saw bottles of complementary water.

Wish we could have stayed longer,Katesiony,"We were able to get a last minute booking after falling victim to internet fraud for an apartment booking in Singapore in November 2011 (no option to choose this date, so not feb 2012), and this hotel was around the corner from our bogus apartment. It was a beautiful hotel, definately worth the 5 stars and money. We would have stayed longer, but there was a conference on, so we could only stay the one night. The buffet breakfast was the best I have ever had, amazing variety, and ace to see the chefs making everything on the spot. We had our daughter with us (almost 3) so while there were other kids there, I was careful to monitor her roaming and behaviour during breakfast as there appeared to be lots of meetings taking place. I would definately come and stay here again.‚Ä¶",5,,

Afternoon Tea @The Bar & Alfresco Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,tosellisw5,Dropped in for afternoon tea with my husband. We decided to sit in the Alfresco section and not inside where the air-con was way cold as with most outlets in Singapore.  Afternoon tea served on a traditional stand and not on a buffet  with a choice of TWG tea at $38++ per person was a pleasant surprise and sufficient.  Portions just nice  - not too much. The scones were a let down.They were heated up and then just became hard and dry. The rest of the items on offer were nice. Perfect place if you do not want noise and children running around.,4,,

Every staff in the hotel whom we encountered were so friendly and attentive.  The front office manager, Ms. Woo Hou-You, whom we had the pleasure of meeting really made our trip that much more special.

But make sure to make a reservation to get a nice table, since it  seems to be quite popular, especially at the weekend. The hotel also has a nice pool, which was not crowded at all.

The view from the room was average but to be expected in the centre of the city.

Nearly perfect,Katrina70,"We stayed at the Four Seasons just before Christmas with our 3 children.  I chose the Four Seasons because of their faultless service  We were permitted a 4pm check out and access to the Health Club change rooms until 10pm, which was fantastic because we had a 1am flight to catch.  I have found that a lot of hotels won't guarantee inter-connecting rooms, but the Four Seasons had no problem with this.  There was a child size bathrobe for my youngest child and biscuits, juice and macaroons waiting in the room when we arrived.  The roll out bed we had asked for was all ready and set up.   The location is superb - a shopping mall back from the top end of Orchard Rd.  Orchard Road was dripping in Christmas decorations and it was a lovely time of year to go to Singapore.

We stay at four seasons because they have THE most comfortable beds out of any of 5* hotels. Like sleeping on a cloud. Bed Linen has a luxurious silky feel, not the usual hotel standard issue. When travelling quality of sleep is important to us. it's No wonder they win industry awards for their beds!  Great location, can walk everywhere, close to shops & restaurants on orchard rd. no need for taxi's or a car.  Only complaint No free wifi !! Very disappointed.

Practically perfect in every way,Trg43,"This was our first stop in Singapore.  We were on our way to Australia.  The Four Seasons was fantastic.

Every single member of staff we came into contact with was fantastic.  Our room was very big, the bathroom had an enormous shower.  There were plenty of fresh, clean, soft towels.

We booked into the Four Seasons as part of our mini honeymoon and stayed for 4 nights. We were going to book into the Marina Bay Sands based on the very little research I had done on Singapore but were referred to the Four Seasons by a local friend, who said that the Four Seasons was a better option. He was spot on.  On arrival we were given glasses of juice and water while we checked in. The staff advised us that we had been upgraded to the 'Couples floor' which meant our room was upgraded and we also received a few additional extras such as chocolate covered strawberries and so forth.

I'm struggling to find a word to describe how good it was. From reservation to departure the service was outstanding: perfectly choreographed and appropriately pitched. The staff were effective, confident, polite and formal enough, while also being outgoing and friendly.   Together with the design of the public spaces (there are numerous intimate spaces that feel like the sitting areas of a house, instead of a grand lobby that feels like the hall of a train station) the service contributed to a very pleasant atmosphere in which even the other guests seemed nice and at ease, rather than being as demanding and stressed as at other hotels.

"top business hotel, what you expect of a Four Seasons",citymouse225,"somewhat typical 4S hotel but more ornate and ""less zen"" than their other properties I've been to (Istanbul, NY, London, Paris, Bev Hills).  The hotel has the magnificent florals as always but the overall feel is more busy that the other properties.  Rooms are nice and the service is,as one would expect, impeccable. Of particular note is that this hotel had one of the best concierge desks I've seen in a long time.  Not only willing to help and provide information but the two women i consulted with were very knowledgable about the airport, shopping ideas and restaurants.  More so than the average concierge at other 5 star properties.  I just didn't love the atmosphere as I do other 4S but it is truly a lovely hotel.",4,,
Wonderful surprise awaits,onthetrailagain42,"I am a member of the Marriott but due to a change in their awards program I search for another hotel.  Then I came across a special on the Four Seasons. It was actually the same price as the Marriott.  I had not stayed there for 5 years.  I was so surprised at the level of service at this hotel compared to others in Singapore.  It was like going to a different planet.  Even the JW Marriott in Hong Kong , which I love, did not match this amazing hotel.  Singapore is getting very expensive however it is worth the experience to pay alittle more for this fantastic hotel, also at a very good location.  On check out day they brought me a cup of tea right after the wake up call.  WOW",5,,
Haven of relaxation in busy Singapore,Polo2,"The Four Seasons brand stands out for its consistently high standards of accommodation and service. The Four Seasons in Singapore does not disappoint. It is well situated just off the bustling Orchard road. Close to shopping malls, restaurants etc. the nearby Ion shopping mall being the best. Ion also contains the Orchard stop on the MRT underground. It is well worthwhile the effort to become acquainted with the MRT system. It provides easy, quick and straightforward access to all the sights in Singapore. It is almost possible to walk the few minutes to Ion under shelter of trees and building canopies, important to bear in mind when you consider the likelihood of frequent showers at any time of day.

Usual great Four Seasons service; comfortable and pretty good location,GRW720,"The Four Seasons group represents traditional comfort, excellent service and good locations.  The Four Seasons in Singapore fits the pattern in all respects.  The location is convenient for the Orchard Road shopping and is pretty central. I believe it is more convenient for many purposes than the Marina area, though previous stays at the Marina Ritz Carlton have never seemed inconvenient or badly located so perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference. At any rate it doesn't take long to get a taxi, Orchard Road is an easy three minute walk away, and the MRT is not far.  We were lucky enough to get the Four Seasons for less than the Grand Hyatt, so there was really not much of a contest for us: after a day of business meetings and general Singapore stickiness, the‚Ä¶",5,,

It still is my favourite in SIN,AFFrequentFlyer,"Having explored other hotels in town in the recent past & reviewed one or two - I am compelled to write a review about the Four Seasons Hotel where I stayed on many occasions 2007-2012. It's the impeccable service that distinguishes it from the other five stars in town . Although the building from the outside is nothing special (on my first stay, I was disappointed when approaching the hotel from the taxi) , the little things, the ""welcome back to us"" , the fantastic breakfast and great rooms (and incredible bathrooms equipped with L'Occitane products ... that make it a wonderful place to stay - a near boutique hotel feel !

Breakfasts were great, good variety and standard of dishes. We weren't flying out until late that evening and the staff in the club were incredibly obliging and the facilities were really good. We always stay at the shangri-la hotel and thought this time as we weren't travelling with our kids that we would try somewhere else. The rooms are comparable, in fact I prefer the decor and position at the four seasons better but for atmosphere pool area and the general feel of a hotel, nothing compares to the shangr-la for us.

The Four Seasons is a really good home from home. All of the team are amazing. They have the best Bell team I have ever encountered anywhere in the world. They know the regular guests by name and they are usually the first people the guest sees on their arrival at the hotel and the last they see on departure.  The rooms are well furnished and quite spacious. I have read in other reviews that some reviewers have complained about torn fabrics in the room.

The room we got was an executive suite and was on promo (3rd night free). After a long tiring day we always looked forward to going back to our hotel room because it was so relaxing....bed was very comfortable!!! We also loved the location because it was just a few minutes walk to Orchard Road. They even had a walkway from the hotel connecting to Hilton Orchard. I would have given it an excellent rating if they were able to accommodate our early check in and late check out. But it wasn't really their fault because the hotel was really fully booked.,4,,

Thoroughly enjoyable with upgrade thrown in,Daniel C,"I visited the Four Seasons for only a one night stay on a business trip in April 2012. The hotel decor is fairly typical for this region, though perhaps could do with a refresh in some areas. The check-in process was fast and efficient and I was delighted to have been upgraded from a superior room to a suite. Due to my departure time the next day, I preferred to have a late check-out, which I requested and was immediately granted, with no problem. I was accompanied to my room by the check-in agent and shown around all the facilities in the lounge/office, large bedroom and large bathroom with separate toilet.

Out of Date,Firsyclass,"I have stayed at this hotel on a monthly basis for the past year for business but have recently made the decision to move to a competitor hotel in the same area of Orchard Road. The reason has been the decline in service standards and food quality and the general aged appearance of the hotel, The 20th floor pool is in need of a complete revamp! Compared to its Asian Four Seasons counterparts in Hong Kong and Guangzhou and elsewhere, FS Singapore has a long way to go to catch up. The food  is just down right not appetizing and the Cantonese restaurant JNC has slowly declined over the years.

This is the only hotel I have stayed at in Singapore other than the Grand Hyatt but I am at a loss to understand the number fo Excellent and Very Good reviews. This hotel is average at best. There is nothing especially wrong with it but a number of areas of improvement:  1. The staff here seem to be incapable of respecting a Do Not Disturb sign. On more than one occasion, the staff have entered when the DND sign has been hanging outside.  2. Service is inefficient.

Four seasons manages to balance their adaptation lo local taste without compromising their signture feel and brand.

We preferred the one on 3/f to do laps. The gym is average size, ticks all the boxes for equipment and it has windows!

We had exceptional service from when we checked it to when we checked out (from concierge to lobby staff).   The old-school french doors to the marble bathrooms were a real surprise, one I haven't seen anywhere else before. And the use of L'Occitane products was also another plus point. The room's interior consisting of big windows which allow for plenty of natural bright light and an amazingly comfortable plush bed.   Another nod to this hotel would be its location.  Given that it's off the main road i.e. Orchard Road, it's quieter and less hectic but still within easy walking distance. The shady trees around the hotel make the walk (night or day) a pleasant‚Ä¶",4,,
A gracious hotel.,valentinatravels,"It was a pleasure to stay at the Four Seasons. Service is excellent, and it's a discreet oasis of clam in a hectic city. Walking into the pretty lobby is a pleasure, the dorman and concierge are unfailingly helpful and the scent of jasmine and green tea is heavenly. The interiors are classical - perhaps slightly dated - but somehow hospitable as a result. We booked a deluxe suite to stay in with our son - and found it to be much smaller than the photos indicated. The single beds really were single beds! So the next day, with Zoltan's kind assistance, we paid to upgrade to a one bedroom suite which was far more spacious and pleasant. The restaurants provided lovely food - but were a bit dark for my liking. Some more natural light over breakfast would be better. Overaly though, a‚Ä¶",5,,
Gracious Hospitality coupled with a lovely room,S M,"This hotel was a pleasure to stay in, esp after a very impersonal experience of 3 days at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The hotel's interiors lean towards the heritage/classical style which is far cosier and hospitable. The reception staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way in giving us helpful suggestions regarding the kind of room to book and ways to manage our time till we left for the airport. The staff even advised us to deposit the luggage and use a waiting area inside for a gap of about 3-4 hrs between the check-out time and our departure time.This was our first experience at a four seasons hotel and it definitely encourages me to try out this chain in other cities too. The breakfast was superb. The room was very spacious and so was the washroom. The‚Ä¶",5,,
"Superb Service, nice bar, excellent breakfasts",Colin M,"4 Seasons is my hotel of choice in Singapore.  Have stayed in about 20 hotels in Singapore, and this is my favorite.  The differentiating factor is probably the service.  The concierge, doormen (especially), front desk staff are all excellent.   I especially like the way they really do seem to to try to find ways to keep people happy.  My only slight niggle is the reception; there is no queuing system and on least one occasion I have had somebody cut in front of me.  The bar is very pleasant, and the restaurant also pretty good, especially for breakfasts which are excellent.  Location is obviously also very good if you want to be near Orchard Road.",5,,

The best hotel in Singapore,ArizKohli,"I don't know what to say about the Four Seasons, it was just superb from arrival to departure.  Got there about 2 pm, we had a boulevard room reserved and ready but I had forgotten to request a smoking room and there weren't any available. They offered me an upgrade to the suite and I was in the mood for some space and pampering so took it up at 150 SGD + taxes a night.  The service, the room, the staff, breakfast, concierge service, room service; everything about the four seasons is superb. Special kudos to David at reception at check in time. It seems every member of the hotel staff remembers you by name.  The hotel is very conveniently located to access all parts of Orchard road and getting a taxi was never more than a 5 minute wait.  If I had to nitpick; the 20 floor pool‚Ä¶",5,,
"Absolutely, Definitively, Amazingly, the best service we've received worldwide!",Todd F,"Although a bit subdued, the Four Seasons Singapore is without-a-doubt the best hotel we've experienced.  From checkin, with complimentary wait-time in the ""living room"" to the clerk's self guided tour of our room, nothing was left to ""pedestrian.""  This was our first stay and a Four Seasons, but I can honestly say, that if their property in Singapore was an indicator of the level of service they provide, we will choose-first The Four Seasons, wherever we travel.  Thank you to the staff for making our trip most-extraordinary!",5,,
Luxury Hotel. Walking distance to main shopping.,TheDinas,"The moment you walk into the lobby, you can feel the grandeur of this hotel. From the lobby men who open the doors and greet you with a warm smile every time, so the reception who are kind and friendly.  I stayed in a deluxe suite which feels like I'm in a palace. The only downside is the price. This place is super expensive $400 per night. You can get similar luxury in Singapore for under $300 so the only downside is that I feel this is just way over priced.  But the details and lengths this hotel go to, really differentiate it from others. In my room which again feels like a palace, the best is huge, soft and comfy, there are little poems, soft music CDs and sleep tip books. There is a 101 things to do box in the rooms in which a guest picks a ticket out of a box and it gives‚Ä¶",5,,

Worth every penny.....almost,GRT7V,"Booked this hotel for seven nights as it has two outdoor and two indoor tennis courts but I disputed the charges for using them as a paying guest. Outdoor courts charge was dropped (they suck anyway) and indoor court cost halved, still harsh though as there should be no charge at all. Afterall, hotel does not charge you to use the pools! That said, great indoor courts. Spa good, as are the staff. Friendly efficient service; nice spacious rooms; good level of house keeping and laundry. Afternoon Tea was good; bar lounge and staff are great. Superb dining and overall.....I will stay again during my next business trip.",4,,
Wonderful hotel on Orchard Boulevard,Philip098,"After a long journey I was deeply impressed by this wonderful hotel on Orchard Boulevard in the center of Singapore, which is surrounded with all this gardens and trees. Even this building has 20 floors it is a place of silence connected with Orchard Road by a skywalk. In the solid atmosphere I found everything, I needed. The buffet for breakfast contained all delicacies from the european and asiatic kitchen and during the day the convenient armchairs invited me to sit down for drinking tea.  All the rooms where beautyful and clean and even in the bathroom they had soap, showergel, shampoo and conditioner from Occitane, which I didn't expect.

Not very four seasons at all,iloveluxuryholidays,"We arrived at the hotel for check in with 2 completely knackered children, one of whom was asleep in my arms.  I am normally used to a really warm welcome at four seasons, a sit down please have a drink while I process your card details etc, this place maybe because it is a city hotel did not offer anything like that.  They could see that I was tired and my children were asleep from a very long journey, the check in took forever.  During check in they told me that they were going to charge me an extra ¬£400 because I had 2 children, I told them that I had disclosed everything to the travel agent we had gone with and that the room should be big enough for an extra bed and an extra cot.

The day of the actual reception, we needed a lot of assistance from the staff with printing documents, room service, and other last minute items we needed assistance with.

The location is very convenient for shopping and dining.  One can walk to the closest shopping malls in minutes and mostly in air conditioned area which is very important since Singapore is quite hot and humid.    Their buffet breakfast is not bad at all with a very pleasant staff.  The concierge and front desk staffs are very helpful and courteous. The only negative point is that neither stationery,  nor magazine are provided in guest rooms.  Furthermore, there's no daily free newspaper delivered to the rooms.

One of their more tired properties - still great service,LondonSW3,"This is one of those Four Seasons where the physical plant does not support the service standard that their staff provide.  The building is well located if you're interested in being up in the Orchard Road area, a bit of an inconvenience if you have meetings in the centre.  Important point to consider given one's meeting schedule.  Well-located for tourist attractions.  The building itself feels a bit like a '70s or early '80s apartment building and while the rooms are nicely appointed with the usual Four Seasons touch the whole experience is a little underwhelming (not as bad as their tired Toronto property) and utterly generic.  Service from door staff, front desk and concierge was excellent and organised transport and meals flawlessly.  Breakfast service was somewhat chaotic‚Ä¶",3,,

The rooms are in excellent shape for the price you have to pay. The rooms are larger than neighboring Hilton and Regent. But mostly, the service is top-notch. If you are looking for a stay in the Orchard Road area, but away from the madding crowd, you should consider Four Seasons for a truly 5-star experience.

The Best Hotel Experience I Have Had,Likemyspace,"In terms of hotel experiences, This is arguably the best I have had in my adult life. As a family of four, we reached there at 0630 in the morning after an overnight flight. We did not have early check-in booked, but from the second we arrived, the hotel made us feel welcome. They immediately prepared one of their private lounges with blankets and pillows for the kids followed by a service of croissants, hot chocolate and breakfast rolls.   The rooms were gorgeous and spacious, not to mention they upgraded us to a suite with an interconnecting room. Service across the board was superb through the 7 days we were there  The concierge service was the best at any hotel I have travelled to.

This visit was also a pleasure, the rooms and lobby are showing a bit of age and the 20th floor pool was totally void of any 5 star service. The food was grossly overpriced and the quality of the menu in the 190 restaurant was disappointing as well was the food. I never saw more than 5 guests for any dinner service, making for a depressing eating environment. But overall I would return to the hotel , but would eat elsewhere in town.",3,,

Check this out - The full room rate which I was going to book was $470/night and the offer was 'Stay two nights get the third free'. What they ended up doing was just increase the room rate to $650/night to make it almost the same price as paying the normal rate. That's just outrageous.  How do you expect guests to not take offense when you have an offer like this and then just charge a higher rate for the room that almost makes it the same price anyway.

It locates on the quieter side of Orchard Road, meaning a 10-min walk from hotel to Orchard MRT station and the big malls on Orchard Road. If there were taxis dropping off guests, there may be a short of taxis at front. Or the hotel staff were always nice to help call a cab for you.

A truly five-star experience,jamesjen25,"Back in Singapore again, it was time I stayed at my favourite hotel. I haven‚Äôt reviewed this hotel yet mainly because I could not find any faults the last time, and to be honest all my negatives here are really just nitpickings. Located smack-dab in central Orchard road, a stone‚Äôs throw from the gigantic Ion shopping mall as well as other shopping and eating venues, the hotel is definitely convenient. Lovely rooms, incredible service and good facilities ensure that I will be returning soon.  +++: Rooms: The rooms I have stayed in are fairly simple, with no fancy gadgets or overly opulent decorations, but it just feels right. To put it simply, it feels like home. Nicely sized bathrooms with separate shower/bathtub, dressing table, work table, a small couch to relax on and a‚Ä¶",5,,
Excellent Business Hotel - good service.,PG1201,"I stayed here for 2 nights while on business in Singapore. Its located in a very quiet location, slightly off Orchard road, but not exactly close to Marina bay or the business district. Service is excellent and personalised. Rooms were quite large and beautiful, everything was perfectly in place for a business hotel, This one was more traditional as compared to Four seasons Hongkong.  The hotel is superb in all respects but I have stayed at other Singapore business hotels which I would personally rank better than Four seasons Singapore - St. Regis Singapore and the Fullerton Bay.",4,,
very nice,77wheretonext,"Very nice hotel with large rooms. Bathrooms are particularly nice with huge vanity areas, big showers and stand alone tubs. Service at the hotel was fantastic. Canapes in the evenings are a nice touch.  Location was a little inconvenient for us, but not a big problem. The hotel does connect to Orchard Road via some long air-conditioned hallways (bit like a mall with shops along the way). From there, it is an additional 5 minute walk (outside) to get to nearest subway stop. There are lots of shops and restaurants on Orchard, but mainly international stores that you can find in many major cities. Haji Lane was more interesting to me for shopping because of the local boutiques. Easy to get a taxi from the hotel, the bell men are always there to help with that, and the taxis are not‚Ä¶",5,,
THE go to place in Singapore!!,Peter W,"The Four Seasons Singapore lived up to my expectations and more! An absolutely top notch hotel by all standards. From the moment the car picked me up at the airport, to the complimentary breakfast waiting for me in my room, to the fresh fruit set out each day, to the personalized service at every turn, the Four Seasons had me at ""Hello"".

Oasis of comfort in the heart of Singapore,Marco-NB-Polo,The Four Seasons is a Top Five Star Property but with a very personal touch. The hotel has 18 floors but still you feel as if everybody knows you and as if you everybody there. Rooms are very comfortable with everything top clean and luxurious. Super friendly and professional staff. Gym is fully equipped and sauna and steam bath are modern and comfortable. Breakfast and lunch buffet offer some of the best varieties in town. The bed is one of the best I ever had of all 5 star hotels in the world. On the downside one may mention the somewhat outdated swimming pool on the 3rd floor where the showers don't work properly-but there is another smaller pool on the top level. Then the sitting area inside next to the pool needs a revamp and really annoying is the internet charge of‚Ä¶,5,,
Solid quality... My second home when in Singapore,karza,"What can I say, again very solid performance from Four Seasons Singapore. Great service, excellent rooms, luxurious but still comfortable atmosphere. Very friendly staff, most of them remembering your name (I have a difficult Swedish name).

If I had to complain about something that would be the availability of taxis but I guess that's more Singapore problem overall than hotel's.",5,,
Traditional Hotel with Wonderful Service,frangipani7,"My husband and I very much enjoyed the Mandarin Oriental the last time we were in Singapore (nearly 2 years ago), but we decided to return to the Four Seasons this time because 1) the guest rooms had been remodeled since our previous stay (4 years ago) and we wanted to see the updates, 2) we wanted to be near the wonderful holiday lights on Orchard Road, and 3) we're generally Four Seasons fans.  We stayed for two nights just before Christmas and one night just after the New Year.  We booked a deluxe room for the two nights in December and a superior room the one night in January.  Both times we were put in identical rooms on the 11th floor, which is a ""couples floor"".  The main advantage for us was free internet, which the Four Seasons usually charges for.

Nice but a notch below other four seasons hotels,amit,"This is a nice hotel with a very good location.

The room I got was large and had all the ammenities that one would typically expect from a luxury hotel of this standard.

Didn't Disappoint,diandruss2016,"Once again loved our stay at the Four Seasons, it is the little finishing touches that puts it above alot of top quality hotels.  From when we arrived to when we left nothing was too much trouble, the staff from the door to the dining room were lovely, always a smile and hello. The breakfast had everything for all nationalities, japanese, chinese and of course a good old english, eggs done whatever way you choose, I loved the pastries as well especially the fruit and nut fresh loaf which was delicious!!! The room was lovely with fresh fluffy towels, fresh sheets, with a good view of the city line. I would recommend this hotel just for the lovely finishing touches that you get, Hats off Four Seasons.",5,,
"Plush hotel, but service was surprisingly lacking",FoodEnthused,"The room was spacious, cozy and warm. The bathroom was luxurious. The bed was amazing to sink into after a long day out. The key word here would be 'plush'! Everything you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel.  However, we were surprise and slightly disappointed with the level of service.   Our room was not cleaned despite being out of the hotel the whole day, and the turn-down service never came. The F&B service crew were efficient but cold; we had our baby with us and received no help with our stroller especially when we had trouble going up and down the steps at the coffee house. Hardly the warm and friendly service we are accustomed to from a Four Seasons team.  That said, we enjoyed our room enough to want to come back to stay. It is also very convenient to walk through‚Ä¶",4,,
Excellent,TheGaffer49,"I love this hotel, largely because it is not too big, has excellent service and is in a great location. I stay here twice a year, and still recommend it. The only caveat is it does seem to have slipped a little. My room was not as perfectly clean as expected (very minor things but one expects perfection at the Four Seasons), and breakfast was a little chaotic whereas it used to be seamless. However, it still is amazing service overall, and has a great buffet breakfast (expensive so try to get it included in the rate). The room decor is pretty but neither feminine or masculine - has a good balance. Service still remains top notch.",5,,
Really First Class and the best chinese food,passeportLondon,"This was our second time staying here, another first class stay, this time we tried their chinese restaurant as we had to entertain some friends and after a 14 hour flight really did'nt want to go out.  I am not a big chinese food fan but now I am, the mango prawns and the steamed stuffed tomato unbelievably good!! Probably one of the best city hotels in the world.  The room was really spacious and they gave us lovely small desserts and a treat for our teen. The gym was very well equipped and spotless, sadly we did'nt have enough time to use the pool. We also ate at the outside bar and the food was really good there too, it has a really nice ambience with fans to counteract the steamy heat.

Excellent Hotel for Business Travelers and Tourists alike,vpsharma,"I stayed in Hotel Four Seasons, Singapore for about a week. It is an excellent place to stay for business travelers as well as tourists. It is located on Orchard Boulevard in Singapore, which is a nice and quiet road to experience a gentle side of Singapore through a casual walk. But those looking for Malls and Movies need not be disappointed - for they are located very close to the Hotel, on the other side, in Orchard Area. The Hotel itself has very good, spacious rooms with good quality furnishing. Services are of high order with smiling and courteous staff. It is not exactly cheap- but good value for money.",5,,

But then driving in orchard is always a challenge. Walking from the hotel to the nearest mrt isn't that far. But the road isn't that well lit so it maybe a little unsettling if your are walking alone at night.  Love the ammenities. We absolutely love the pool.   Got an additional room for our friends.

This time I stayed during a business trip to Singapore and the quality and service have remained consistently excellent.  I would say that this is one of my favourite city hotels in Asia.  Everything from the ambiance, room quality (super comfortable bedding), breakfast and service overall are excellent.

Overrated,CutiCutiTime,"This is an overdue review as my wife and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in May last year. But since we just returned from another holiday in Singapore (its Grand Hyatt this recent trip), its more relevant now to compare Four Seasons Singapore than before.  First off, most guests would come to expect top notch service and accommodation when selecting a Four Seasons - partly due to its reputation and the going premium rate per room night that undermines even other 5 star hotels.  I tried hard yet failed to notice any significant aspect of this hotel that supposed to make it a great hotel. Location wise, its OK if you don't mind 10mins walk each time you wish to go out but with the closure of Borders @ Wheelock Place, its beginning to make the stroll to closest mall or Orchard‚Ä¶",3,,

"As expected, a best choice",GPS001,"It is quite difficult to fail when selecting a Four Seasons hotel, and the Singapore one is no exception. I have been impressed by the efifciency and courtesy of all staff, starting from the doormen at the entrance of the hotel. These people, often so overlooked, represent the first impact when arriving in a hotel, and they can make a difference when waiting for a taxi. I have found them to be amongst the best of my long experience in travelling.  I had a normal room (no Club floor) and yet it was excellent in all aspects. I resent in such class of hotels to have to pay extra for Internet, but the connection was fast and super easy to access.  Breakfast was excellent, service good, newspapers available in quantity, I had a small snack at the bar and it was excellent. Finally,‚Ä¶",5,,
Oasis of peace & comfort,samjiggs,"The Four Seasons is the perfect hotel in Singapore: it is not too big, it is not located in the hustle & bustle of a major street or in the shadow of a tourist attraction, its rooms are perfectly proportioned and appointed, its staff are universally friendly without being obsequious, its food consistently excellent and its bar well-stocked...  I could easily and happily go on, but having recently returned from what has become an annual stay at the hotel, it is a reassuring constant of quality and service in a world increasingly obsessed with less substantive values. Whether on business, as I was, or for pleasure, I would have no hesitation in recommending the hotel to anyone - except those looking for glitz and ostentation.  The Four Seasons does luxury in an under-stated, and‚Ä¶",5,,

Perfect location for first-time Singapore visitors,DCTraveler12,"The Four Seasons Singapore is an older hotel.  The upkeep of this hotel was good and our room was very comfortable and clean.  Renovation/Upgrade was done to the room to provide some modern bells and whistles.  The perk of being built longer than other hotels is that it has one of the best locations in the city.  The Four Seasons Singapore is right on Orchard Road and it is connected to a shopping plaza underground.    However, our minor complaint is that the window of our room was dirty outside, with the high humidity of Singapore; it was hard to see anything from inside the room.   They should really clean their windows more often, after all, they are Four Seasons, and that is what their customers expect from them.",5,,
"Wow, a true 5 star experience!",Pilvi,"Stayed here for three nights at the end of our wonderful Singapore stay. The hotel is outstanding and the service is even better. Our daughter (4 yrs) was treated like a princess:) Good location, close to the shops but still in a quiet spot.   The room was large enough and had a great bathroom with all amenities one could hope for. The hotel has two pools, we used the roof top pool and our 4 yrs old loved the toys they had. Very quiet and nice to spend time around the pool.   Loved everything about this hotel, would love to stay here again!!",5,,
Fantastic hotel,FHL_10,"My husband, son (13) and I stayed at the Four Seasons for three nights in July 11. We were so warmly welcomed by the staff and really appreciated the thoughtful gift of a backpack from the reception staff to our son, as well as recommendations and real advice on places he might like to visit in Singapore. It was nice to find a hotel that could make a teenager feel so welcome. We loved the easy walk to Orchard Road from the hotel and quick taxi ride to the restaurants at Dempsey Hill. The rooms are large, modern and really comfortable. If we travel to Singapore again, we will definitely stay at the Four Seasons.",5,,

Needs upgrading,w0nderer,"I stayed here about seven years ago, and it looks like they haven't spent much money on upgrading the hotel since then. The room was reasonably sized but is quite dated now and doesn't feel special. The cafe/ restaurant is a bit bland. Likewise the 'club' space is very gloomy and has poor facilities. The only saving grace for the stay was the gym, which has a lot of up to date Life Cycle machines and a good range of free weights.",3,,
Throughly Enjoyed It,Lokim,"We stayed on the third night free deal. The location is terrific: one street back from Orchard Road (OR). Access to OR is via an air-conditioned walkway through the Hilton Hotel. It is quiet, surrounded by tree-lined paths and on a hill. The rooms are sizable (deluxe) and well designed - a good size desk, excellent lighting (for reading) throughout, well designed bathroom and very quiet. We were on a non-smoking floor, no children, no noise and no disruptions by staff - the rooms were not cleaned until after midday. Moreover, there was nothing out of place or in need of repair; even the aircon was quiet! All the staff - from the front door to maintenance were friendly, attentive and helpful.  Sound familiar?

Pricey and Average,Ozwings,"By first appearance the hotel is not visually amazing, the lobby is dull and the facilities a bit cold. Terribly overpriced for what is offered, compared to its competitors St. Regis and Marina Bay, Four Seasons needs a facelift to stay competitive. The Chinese restaurant was not as good as 1 year ago when I visited, and the all day restaurant is lacking an identity.. The location is top notch which is why I chose this hotel again its steps from Orchard, and the 20th floor pool has a great view, just needs to be refurbished a bit..   Dont bother with the concierge they have a bit of an attitude, they had difficulty just changing my air ticket to another date!",2,,

Excellent,B_Travel_7,I found the four seasons in Singapore to be an excellent choice of hotel. The facilities were brilliant and the staff very helpful.

Surely at top prices this service could be free?. All in all highly recommended,5,,
Superlative Business Hotel,Giallo_Rossa_Roma,"I have stayed in this Four Seasons for 2 nights only, and I wish I had spent there more time to enjoy all the luxuries this hotel lavishes on its guests: swimming pool, tennis courts and so on.

The bed and the linen were some of the best I have seen in a long time (and I am a frequent business traveler).

Not up to the standard of a Four Seasons!,jeanadam,"We stayed there for 3 days for visiting.

Concierge was not good, we had the feeling we were annoying her with too many questions. We did ask for a nice peking duck restaurant and it came out to be a bad advice she gave us while after we realized they have a good chinese restaurant in the Hotel.

Traditionally Lovely Four Seasons in a Great Location,kikicole,"We stayed in the Singapore Four Seasons for three nights during our honeymoon and we found this hotel to be well located with great service. Everything we would expect from a Four Seasons hotel. We had an executive suite which we really enjoyed. The hotel picked us up at the airport, and they checked us in while in our room. They seem interested in expanding their clientele to leisure customers, so there seemed to be many options they were using to attract a new demographic. Check in was efficient and easy.

Time for Change,rajesh s,"Stayed at Four Seasons Singapore in August  and was a bit disappointed in the experience. Overall the hotel was nice but it has past its prime compared to other FS hotels in Asia. The Food and Beverage was probably some of the worst I have had at a FS hotel in Asia. In comparison to its other hotels in Hong Kong , Macau and Bangkok , Singapore was not good. The 190 restaurant was a disaster, service was verging on non existent and the food was so uninspired I actually only ate half my meal..  The restaurant manager spent more time on the phone than quality checking. Chinese restaurant smelled like mold, the hot and sour soup was watery, a all around mess.

Atmosphere and location !!!,karza,"There are so many luxury hotels in Singapore that it's difficult to make the difference. All of them have great service, facilities, food etc. However there was something in the atmosphere of Four Seasons that I liked, very calm, sophisticated but relaxed - not uptight at all. Despite the hotel is old in Singapore standards it is extremely well maintained.   Location is great just a bit away from the busy Orchard road in its own peace. Handy air-conditioned shopping tunnel connects the hotel to Hilton at Orchard Road. Also pools are great for relaxing after a work day but not good enough for holiday use (if you are into sun and pools).

But this stay was not particularly impressive, and it did not meet my own personal expectation for a 4S. Personally, a calmed, cooled room with fine linen, along with a marble facaded bathroom is basic for a 4S; customized services to enrich a business travel is what I look forward from 4S.  Certain portion of the staff appeared to be not well-motivated,  and a few staffers to me did not even receive enough training, especially the concierge and the porters.

Good Service and pleasant stay,amitgupta_08,"I stayed at Four Seasons for more than a week, on a business trip. Perfectly located for shopping and dining - just across Orchard Road. Mine was a spacious room with a king size bed, and with an extra large bathroom. The room over looked the Orchard Road area. Buffet breakfast has good variety and quality. The room has internet and a good range of TV channels. The swimming pool is pretty small and was a disappointment. Did not use the spa or gym, but had a walk through them and they looked very clean and well maintained.  Besides that, check-in and check-out were very quick and hassel free.  Since Four Seasons does not have a Membership Program, it might not be an attractive option for frequent travellers. Service and quality were exceptional though.",4,,
Great Hotel!,mai_a216,"Stayed here with our 3 kids for a vacation. Loved how they tried to put attention to each of the guests with welcome notes and packets for the children. They also gave a birthday cake and cookies for my son who was celebrating his birthday. The concierge was very efficient in booking us good seats for the Lion King and printing out our boarding passes as well. We stayed in the suite with a connecting deluxe room for the kids so it was a big space for us and we were quite happy with the comfort of the beds. They also provided a brass crib and sterilizer for the baby. Although the suite room looked a BIT on the tired side, it was well made up for by the cleanliness of the room, bathroom,  and the inviting beds.

Beautiful hotel attentive staff,esper0,My wife and I stayed at the Four Seasons 15th to 24th June 2011. Perfect surroundings attentive polite helpful staff. Very very professional clean rooms excellent pool gym sauna and so forth. To make this hotel perfect sort out the wireless connection prices there really is no excuse this day and age to charge $35 a day for connection. I fully understand that this is a 5 star hotel but even so this is far to much. But all in all very good the best stay ever in singapore!!!,4,,
Staycation in town,LeAnne L,Our first experience with Four Seasons and we were given a nice upgrade.  A very pleasant surprise and a great way to celebrate Christmas.  The check in was personal and friendly.  Cute little robes and amenities for my children.  Hotel is situated at a quieter side of Orchard road.  Away from the crowds but near to everything that orchard road has to offer in my humble opinion.  Extra points with toys provided at the rooftop swimming pool.  I believe having a swimming pool on the rooftop is something quite unique.,4,,
Best bed! Huge room.,SAPOID,"When we arrived, I dont know what the staffs were doing but I ended up taking the suitcases out of the cab myself. Never happened to me in any other 5star hotels.  Other than that we loved the hotel, the lobby had scents and it smelled great all the time. We did not spend enough time at the hotel, but I remember that their service was fast, for instance when I had called housekeeping for something, it immediately arrived. The bathroom was big! The standard room was very spacious!  The best part of the hotel was the bed and pillows, the best from any hotels I have ever stayed in!",5,,
Didn't live up to my expectations,Yifeng,"We booked at the Four Seasons as an intentional splurge after some more challenging travel and expected a high level of service.  Things started out okay.  After booking, we got several emails from the hotel asking about any special needs or requests.  However, we got so many emails that it started to get a little annoying--especially the repeated requests about whether we wanted to use a hotel car to pick us up at the airport.  Having been to Singapore several times, we knew that taxis were easy to get at the airport, were clean and not expensive.  We had to say  ""no"" to the car service at least three times--and the last email we received was kind of obnoxious, telling us that we would be sorry for not using a hotel car.  We also communicated several times about the age of our‚Ä¶",4,,
it's a classy hotel,keiragopi,"we stayed here for two nights, one night in a deluxe room and the next in a suite.  it's not a new hotel but but I must admit that I like the feel of the understated luxury and boutique feel of four seasons compared to the other bigger hotels or more opulent hotels in singapore.",5,,
great rooms and excellent service,marketme,"Well located, The Four Seasons in Singapore feels like a boutique hotel with warm and friendly customer care. I particularly found the concierge team very helpful as they steered me in the right directions. Breakfast was good, the team in the main restaurant were great too - proactively finding me a magazine for my solo dinner visit. Only comment would be to warn guests that the best way back to the hotel is through the Hilton when coming from Orchard Road (despite the address for the Four Seasons being ON Orchard Road). Day one left the hotel in daylight and emerged from shopping after dark and couldn't find my hotel for the first time in my life! Pity I had lots of shopping bags and very sore feet!",5,,
The best child friendly Hotel,yitravelMumbai,"The Four Seasons is easily the most child-friendly and comfortable hotel we've visited.

Excellent stay. A true home far away from home.,Noisette-May,"Staying in Four Seasons is always fabulous. The greeting from the Porters and Doorman shows a very warm welcome. The Receptionist is friendly, courteous. The bedroom is very elegantly furnished and yet relaxing. The bathroom is spacious, too, with luxurious toilettries. Porter always delivers the luggage in timely manner. The breakfast is a great thing to start the day; sumptuous food, a real gourmet delight for the morning. The turndown service is very nice, too; the chambermaid always prepares a bucket of ice ready to the guest to make some cocktails. The hotel's green attitude is also well applied; offers the guests the option whether or not the linen and towel changing is desired.",5,,
Probably my best hotel stay EVER!,Leopard_Lil,"I have just returned from a four night stay at the Four Seasons in Singapore (after a Far East cruise) and I just have to put down my thoughts about how FABULOUS the Four Seasons in Singapore is.  From the moment our driver picked us up from the cruise terminal to the moment when he let us off at Changi airport, the hotel exceeded all of my expectations.    Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, but we hadn't expected it to be, seeing as how we were there in the morning.  However the staff bent over backwards to find us a room and after a delightful pot of tea in the club area, we were in our room before lunch.  It was great.

Excellent Stay,rafalution_2009,"Four Seasons has always been my favourite - it sets the standards in terms of service and the comfort, which of course, comes with a price.  FS Singapore is located just off Orchard Road, convenient for holidaymakers and those on business trips. Checking in was a breeze. Our daughter was given a wide selection of  toys to pick. Now, this is certainly a smart business move by the hotel as she had instantaneously became a FS fan!  Absolutely no complaints about the room and bathroom - spacious with a luxury feel, like other FS properties I've stayed in. However, some guests may find the furnishing a bit dated.

Superlative service - a true reflection of the Four Seasons brand,londonfoodie88,"We stayed 6 nights in April and every single person made our stay here special.  This was my second time here - the last one was in 2008. Alex Porteus the Hotel Manager is one of the friendliest and most professional person we have come across in the hotel industry.  You can tell how good a hotel is with the way they deal with problems.  We had a slight hiccup when the staff entered the room despite being told we did not want anyone coming during our stay, but this problem was dealt with promptly and professionally.  Good location, high quality fixtures and fittings but the thing that sets this hotel apart is the superlative service.  We stayed in a superior room with separate shower.  Breakfast is good but not quite as good as 3 years ago. Fitness room and 2 pools are good too.",5,,

The kids pool on the 20th floor was very good and the room had some nice kids touches (kids bubble bath and bath robes etc.)  Easy access to Orchard Road with the walking link via the Hilton handy on the humid days.  Coffee machine in the room was a pleasant surprise.    Yes you have to pay 5 Star prices, but that doesnt seem to matter as much when you experience genuine 5 Star quality and service.",5,,

Not up to expectations,Keith44449,"Four Seasons is a famous brand for luxury around the world.  But this hotel did not meet my expectation given the price.  The electronic hookup didn't work, the in room safe failed twice, and a dvd they lent me didn't work on the player in the room.

What you can expect from Four Seasons in Asia: Top Quality,Siglo,"I was reminded upon check-in that it has been awhile since I stayed with them. I was told that I would be led to my room but as the receptionist was slow, I went myself. The Premier room had the same look and feel as the past: large, classical, cosy, relaxing. Some items looked a bit dated - but no real complaints. Had breakfast and brunch at the Three SIxty Resturant. Excellent offerings and excellent quality. Service staff not 100% knowledgeable about the food. Otherwise they are attentive Location is close to Orchard Road and the best approach if you're walking is via the internal link to the Hilton. Both hotels have the same owner This hotel retains the top quality one can expect from Four Seaons",4,,

WE felt like real VIPS (which we are not)..  Hotel standards, comfort and friendliness right up to 4 Seasons expectations, and its a block and a half walk to Orchard Road.  Obviously, there is a cost, but I got a 3 nights for the proce of 2 deal, which they make available quite often on the web site, and that made it really good value.  Can't fault..",5,,

Best luxury hotel value in Singapore,sabos93,"The Singapore Four Seasons is surprisingly affordable for a luxury hotel. By contrast, properties such as the Sheraton Towers cost the same but offer much lesser value and quality. There are several less expensive hotels in Singapore to be sure, but if you're willing a spend a little more you will not be disappointed.   The rooms are very comfortable and well maintained. The beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a luxury hotel. All of the major amenities are available and the restaurants, though expensive, are very good. If you prefer not to eat in the hotel, Singapore has many wonderful restaurants to chose from though none of them are really walkable.

Close but not all 5's,CruiserDeluxe,"Four Seasons Hotels vary from country to country.  This one is located just off Orchard Road and close to major shopping.  Rooms were very clean.

As a side note, I booked the two nights on expedia which is the way I often do.  This time the rates changed while I was online causing me to have to pay one price for one night and a higher price fof the next.",5,,

One comment though - internet is not free :-(  Room: wonderful room. Feel very cosy except for bed, which I think personally a bit hard. Having said that, I still had a good sleep :-).  Area: Walking distance to Orchard road. It is on the other side of the Orchard. Linked to Hilton - however the link is closed at night.

Past its peak,Racinglemn,"Let me start with the positive sides. This is a decent hotel in the 5 star category and can compete with the international peers generally. The location in Singapore is perfect if you are coming to shop or for sightseeing - Orchard Rd is just a stone throw away, yet the hotel is in a quiet enough location.  If you are coming for business and happen to have to go rather towards Raffles Place, then you will have to allow for a c. 20 minute taxi journey. At first arrival the appearance of the hotel was very pleasant - a high quality lobby and an appearance of value - as you would expect it.

The hotel is very close to nice shops (which has a lot of great food courts - not boring and low quality like in the US, but quite delicious) and if you are up for some longer walks (which is a nice way to burn off some calories to make room for all the eating you should do while in Singapore), then you can explore quite a bit of the city from the hotel (Little India,‚Ä¶",5,,

Not as Nice as Other Four Seasons Properties,Chicagolikes2travel,"Stayed for 3 days in November.    While the hotel is nice enough, it is definitely in the lower quartile of the Four Seasons properties we have stayed in.  Nothing was terribly wrong, but nothing was done that well either.    We arrived late in the evening and it must have taken the desk clerk 30 minutes to check us in (new employee?).    The rooms were ok, but tired -- a little beat up and need of updating.   Each day it took till late afternoon  for our room to be made up and turn down service was hit or miss.  On the positive side, the internet was free (a rarity in Four Seasons) and the room service was quick and tasty.

YES. I did.  I opted for the ""Club"" booking. This is not a ""Club"" like any other you will find. Do not think executive breakfast, evening cocktails and so on. There is nothing to recommend it.

If I had to do it over again I might have stayed closer to downtown where there are more things to do other than shopping.  It was only a short walk to the subway, though.",5,,
Loved it!,Beans04,"The Hotel was great.  Got a room upgrade upon arrival,  staff where very friendly and warm. Room was beautiful and location was great.  Pool wasn't the most interesting, but I guess you don't come to lay by the pool!   Gym was great too.  We didn't eat at the Hotel, chose to go off and explore.   I highly recommend staying here to anyone..",5,,
very pleasant hotel,MSH_FRA,"We stayed three days at Four Seasons in Singapore. It was a very pleasant stay. The room was big and elegantly decorated. Size of the bathroom was particularly impressive. The staff was unusually helpful and polite, they went out of their way to assisst us in everything we requested. The hotel is not located around the bay area but this is compensated by the proximity to Orchard Road, a shopping parapise. Probably one of the best hotels in town (still behind Mandarin Oriental).",5,,
Four Seasons Singapore Will Not Disappoint,ATLTravelsALot,"Quite simply, there are nothing but positives to say about this property.   Every request was handled with unbelieveable efficiency and professionalism.  Nice location off the beaten path of Orchard Rd. but within easy walking distance via a nice park-lined street.  The food, internet speed (the hotel said they recently upgraded to a 100Mbps connection and it shows in the fast speeds I obtained), security, and room amenities are unbeatable.  Concierge, reception, room service, etc. perfect.    This is my new home base in Singapore with I need luxury, 5-star+ accomodations.  Rather expensive, yes.  But, so is most everything in Singapore - the difference is here that you get what you pay for and a lot more.",5,,
Perfect city hotel,Brandon63,"Everything is perfect or very close to perfection at this great city hotel.

"Fantastic location, attentive and friendly staff, lovely hotel.",Ber-10,"Just back from our short break (4 nights) to Singapore staying at the Four Seasons.  Well worth paying that little bit extra for such a lovely hotel.  We felt we got a more personalised service.  The gym and pool were great.  The room was perfect.  Morning and evening the room was tided and towels and toiletries replaced as required.  Bottled water and towels were in abundance!  We ate only once at the hotel for dinner which was very good and I felt it was quite reasonably priced.  We only had the one buffet breakfast. I had a la carte (eggs Florentine $17 which was lovely and a pot of tea $11 and terrible!).  The other mornings we would head out the the vast amount of restaraunts in the vicinity, my fav was starbucks in Ion for a coffee and a pastry.  We only holidayed with one‚Ä¶",4,,
"Outstanding service, location & facilities",NewbayFamily,"Singapore Four Seasons is as good a hotel as you'll get close to or on Orchard Road. We stayed a week with our 6 & 4 yr old and two in-laws. The rooms are a good size with good bathrooms and amenities.  We had an adjoining room with our kids which worked well.   The staff are first class across the board, the service at the restaurants was also good but the food and drink fairly expensive (as with any 5 star Asian hotel), so we chose to eat out mostly with plenty of good places nearby (you are a few minutes cab ride from the Dempsey Rd area which has many good restaurants and bars).      The kids pool on the top floor is excellent, great poolside service too, while the adult pool on the 3rd floor is perfect for laps and a relax in the lounge alongside.

Fantastic Hotel with exceptional Four Seasons service and rooms,cairoexpat,"Though I stay at Four Seasons often, I almost didn't stay there in Singapore because of some of the reviews on TripAdvisor.  After staying there for two nights in August and nine nights in September, I would absolutely recommend the Four Seasons Singapore.  I stayed into two different level rooms and both were wonderfully furnished with super comfortable beds and bedding.  The location is great because it is just behind the Hilton off Orchard.  You get the benefit of being near Orchard without the noise.  Most of all, the staff provided exceptional, friendly service.",5,,
Outstanding!,Chrissy G,"I am currently staying at the Four Seasons, Singapore. Without exception, my experience thus far has been outstanding. The service is impeccable, the room beautiful and the location ideal. To give you an idea of how excellent the service is...I am an allergy sufferer. I have a severe allergy to nuts. Since I have arrived, the hotel staff have gone out of their way to ensure I am safe and not exposed to any food with nuts. So much so...tonight when i ordered room service, i had a visit from the Sous chef to check my meal was okay. And, of course, it was delicious. I can not recommend this hotel to you enough. It is by far the best in Singapore.",5,,
Disappointing - due to high expectations!,LoveShopping,"I had high hopes of this hotel, being part of the Four Seasons Hotel Group, and at the price range it charges, one would expect much better service overall.  Hotel is a bit tired, inside and outside.  Rooms are nicely furnished but nothing out of the extraordinarily.  First of all, the room key also operates as an elevator key.  We travelled with about 40 family members to attend a wedding so we needed to go from floor to floor to visit.  Sometimes the key allows you to go to another floor, sometimes it does not.  Which can be frustrating at times. Check in was very slow - took about 15 minutes to complete registration for one room.  Internet connection in room costs an arm and a leg.  No Wifi at lobby so there is not really an alternative. Bathroom is spacious. Other than that,‚Ä¶",3,,
My kingdom for a good mattress,Habibah M,"I love the 4 Seasons in Singapore - impeccable service where the staff actually remember you  and with sincerity too. The rooms are also very well maintained and bathrooms are sufficiently modern yet with a touch of elegance that is almost old school. But and regretfully I say this - in my most recent stay of 2 nights, i suffered from a bad back largely caused by well a well worn mattresses which is best described as teribbly worn out. It was almost lumpy and must have taken a lot of very heavy people because on either side, the mattress tended to slope towards the end. This meant that every so often I woke up feeling i was sliding off and had to  move really close to the centre. So with my husband having to do the same both of us were squeezed well into the centre - quite cosy‚Ä¶",4,,
"A nice hotel but lacking on the ""Wow""",ryzee,We stayed 3 nights here immediately after staying at the Four Seasons Hong Kong.  FS Hong Kong was an absolutely perfect hotel experience and truly blew us away so I suspect that may be part of why we found the Singapore FS a wee bit disappointing.    We booked  and received a Premier Room which is located on the corner of the building and is slightly larger that the lower category rooms and has wrap around windows.  The room looked as though it needed some upgrading and had a faint musty smell.     Staff were all very nice and the doormen made special effort to learn both mine and my partners names and great us warmly every time we came and went.

Restroom was so big it had two tall double doors, two sinks, a separate room with a Commode and a Bidet, with a sliding door for privacy. It also has a clean quaint looking bath tub (fully functioning) and a gorgeous butt glass covered marble tiled shower box. Oh my god! Restroom was on the top of my concern list in every hotel. This PASSED it all. I didn't rush to get out of the gorgeous restroom!  The hallway leading to the main bedroom was gorgeous. The room itself? BIG!

Besides the fact that football unites and the Dutch were doing well. Also the fitness room was well equiped.  My only trouble was with the bed. I found it a bit to soft, and as my boyfriend and I are not that slim, we had trouble sleeping. The Chinese restaurant upstairs is top notch on most dishes. The one downstairs was pretty good too.

Wonderful Four Seasons Service - as expected,Lee R,"We stayed here for 3 nights with our 2 boys aged 15 and 9.  The boys were treated like princes and upgraded to a suite.  My husband and I only had a premier room!  They were given Four Season caps and, soon after checking in,  the hotel sent up gummy bears, marshmallows and apple juice to their suite.  The suite was divine so we ordered room service and sat and ate our late lunch around their dining table.  We booked this hotel because they had a special deal - stay 3 nights and pay for 2 - making it good value and we have been very happy with Four Seasons in other locations.  The location is quite good with a little walk through the Hilton to get to Orchard Road shopping.  The huge Ion Shopping Centre is very close by.   Breakfast was probably the only disappointment.

excellent stay,debkpropminster,"Room was marvelous! large with TV screen connecting to i-pod/ laptop. Equipped with DVD player. Welcome drink provided in room after entering into the room.

Would recommend to friends in future.",5,,
fabulous,miteshgupta,"We stayed for 18 - 21 june, 2010 and simply enjoyed every moment spent in the hotel. The staff is very nice and friendly, the rooms are large and very luxurious. The food is great. The service is the best - we asked for packing tape and they sent a packing kit with several tools in it within 1 minute; we asked for a band-aid and they sent a medical kit with someone within 1 minute. We checked in at 8 am and they still accomodated us in the club lounge for breakfast and access to the club for showers/stam/sauna etc. and gave the room before 9 am even though check in is at 2 pm. Staff remembered our names and made reservations at restaurants/bars for us even at the last minute. Its right opposite the newly opened ION mall on orchard and close to all major shopping.",5,,
If you want total luxury at your fingertips then this is the place,Tarun H,"Though it is frightfully expensive, this hotel serves as a perfect place to enjoy a romantic getaway in a bustling city.  Four Seasons offers the best service that any hotel can and has the best restaurants and rooms that you can see in the hotel industry.  This particular hotel has a fabulous location and they think through all the needs of a customer and plan ahead.  If you want to relax, enjoy and rock in Singapore then this is the Hotel to stay in.

A very good stay,meringo,"I have stayed in Four Seasons Singapore for a couple of time. Although the hotel is relatively old, but the up keeping and maintenance are still very good. These are my observations :  1. Lobby and reception area It's nice and elegant, very four seasons. The reception works efficiently when checking you in, I don't like waiting too long to get into my room.  2. Room The size is pretty good for Singapore hotel standard, toiletries are from L'Occitane. Lighting wise is not pretty bright, I like brighter room with a dimmer option. Bedding is a little too soft for me, I would prefer harder mattress.

Usual excellent Four Seasons hospitality,traveldiva97,"Gorgeous hotel.  Arrived in the middle of the night .

Allowed 4pm checkout and had great spa area to come back and shower and change for 10 pm flight.  Nice gym and pool.  we were the only ones using it.  Food extremely expensive..  There are many choices right outside the door including the food opera in the mall.  This modern hawker stands with great food right in an adjacent upscale mall.. If you want ot shop there is every designer and store you can think of within a few blocks.  MRT station on corner as well. Near botanical gardens, but otherwise a little removed from central area.  We really enjoyed our stay.",5,,
"Great rooms and location, but just lacking something...",jezza888,"Maybe I am being picky. It is the Four Seasons Singapore we are talking about. Nothing less than complete perfection should be expected. But somehow it didn't hit the spot for us this trip. Perhaps the decor is starting to look dated or the prices have not depreciated to reflect this slowly ageing hotel/model. Service as always, is impeccable. With bell captains and receptionists alike remembering your name and happily answering to your every beck and call. Afterall, this is a Four Seasons. Anyway, let me break down our most recent visit to this place :  Positives : - Service with a smile.

We loved the location - close to Orchard Rd (enter via Hilton) yet not right on the main road itself.  Staff were excellent...helpful and knowledgable and always so friendly.  We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment but prices did look very high.

Many service lapses for a 5 Star Hotel.

We booked an Executive Suite, which was very nice. The hotel was decorated beautifully, everything was clean and well maintained, but...the service was that of a 2 or 3 star hotel, not a Four Seasons.  1) Checkin took around 15 minutes. I have no idea why it took the 2 clerks that long for a simple check-in. It wasn't as if they couldn't find our reservation. 2) Only received fresh fruit in the room 2 out of 5 nights. We were in a suite. 3) No chocolate on the bed with the turn down service. 3) I called room service at 7am for coffee.

"Good, but not my favourite Four Seasons hotel",Musken,"Accommodation:  We had booked a one bedroom suite (room only - stay three nights, pay two nights offer) which was a bargain for this kind of room in a big city. The 1 BR suite was very spacious and layout and furniture in accordance with pictures I had seen online. The view was good and it was not at all a dark suite that I had read somewhere before. Only negative: There was FAR too little wardrobe space, and no separate walk in closet as on the floor plan at the FS site. We had to keep most of our things in the suitcases. Great bed. Efficient and quiet airconditioning.   Pool:  We used the family pool on the 20th floor a couple of times. It was small and not very charming. A number of sun loungers and lots of concrete rather than a lush tropical setting that I had expected.  ‚Ä¶",4,,
Very Pleasant Stay,aaronbond,"I stayed here in March 2010 for a week and very much enjoyed my stay here.   The staff were very friendly and always happy to help, the rooms were immaculate and very spacious and the hotel is in a great location - right by Orchard Road. The food in the restaurant was very good also, particularly the buffet breakfast. I would definitely recommend eating there.  The only downside was the extremely high cost for internet use, in both the business centre and the WIFI in the rooms. The WIFI connection in the room was quite poor as well and pretty slow. I would have expected internet usage in the business centre to be free of charge, but it was far from it.  Overall though, I would recommend this hotel to stay at.

Pickup from the airport was perfect in an S Class MB and reception went smooth with all formalities being done in our room.

By the way, they have a doorbell outside your door, hence the request to knock.  Everything about the hotel is elegant and I like hotels with that kind of ambiance.  It also feels very intimate.  I considered staying at the Marriott for this vacation and I'm glad I stayed at the Four Seasons instead.  The scene outside the Marriott on a weekend is chaos!

"Overall, does live Up to the Four Seasons Name",BENLEE123,"I decide to try out the Four Seasons for one night in one of their one-bedroom suite. They are having promotion for weekend stay which is much lower than their normal rates. Besides, the Four Seasons in Hong Kong is my all-time favorite hotel. I reckon that even if the Four Seasons Singapore is half as good as their sister hotel in Hong Kong ( and their rate is less than half as much ), it will be a satisfactory stay at least.   Arriving  I took a cab to the hotel and upon arrival, the bellboy took care of my luggage in a speedy manner. I was lead to the reception desk for check-in. There‚Äôs no queue so I don‚Äôt need to wait and a polite female staff checked me in.

Reliable Luxury,Topshelf210b,"My husband and I live in Singapore, but we were looking for a place to celebrate his birthday weekend, and get some adult alone-time.  We looked at the St. Regis and the Ritz-Carlton, but ultimately chose the Four Seasons, due to its excellent location right off bustling Orchard Road and its value for money.  We weren‚Äôt disappointed.  After an easy check-in, where we were given a room upgrade without even asking, my husband took a nap while I went to the 20th floor roof-top pool.  The sweet pool attendant made up a lounger for me with plush towels, and then brought me a tray with a cool cloth, a bowl of fresh watermelon chunks and a small mister bottle for my face.

Another Great Four Seasons and a Perfect Escape from the Heat,gwera,"My wife and I stayed here for a long layover in Singapore.

I guess I had very high expectations......,Paul H,"I'm a big fan of Four Seasons hotels and was eagerly anticipating my stay at the FS Singapore - especially with all the glowing reviews here on the TA and other sites. I stayed for 4 days, and whilst on the whole the hotel was good, I don't think it was Four Seasons good as there were quite a few inconsistencies during our stay;  1) Warm Welcome - To me this is very important. However, the greeting at the door or by bell services ranged from over the top to non-existent. When we arrived from the airport, there was absolutely no greeting from the bell man or the door man - and they simply asked how many bags we had and it was not until we reached the reception desk where we were actually greeted properly.

First of all, our room was amazing, the restaurant, especially the breakfast buffet and lounge areas incredible and the locations is superb! But, unfortunately, the staff would not get a 10 from us, except for the concierges. We've visited many FS: Hawaii, Mexico, Thailand, Santa Barbara, SF, etc., and know what to expect. I was really hoping for a super warm welcome from the bellmen right as we entered the doors and it just didn't happen. Then, we procceed to check in and that was a little challanging on it's own.

I was a little worried because I read a negative review on this site about FS Singapore, but we did not experience anything unfortunate during our time here.  In fact, from the minute we were picked up from the airport until we were dropped off again, we only had a wonderful time.   Before we left, reservations called us and asked if we would like to participate in a special offer of a room upgrade for a little more than we agreed upon.

Perhaps one of the grand dames of the hospitality industry in Singapore, I had high hopes for the property. My experiences with the Four Seasons have always been memorable, so let's see what I recalled.  The location of the hotel in unrivaled. It's on Scotts Road, which is just off busy Orchard Road. Upon getting out of the car and stepping into the lobby, I felt this air of luxury. Good start. Our check-in was smooth and we were in our rooms within minutes. The room was clean and the bathroom big. What disappointed me was the state of the bed.

best service best hotel (if on company expense),Anilegna,"haven't been back to the 4 seasons Singapore for years but still the best hotel in town, not necessarily the most interesting hotel (from a design perspective) but the most comfortable hotel and the best service  it's the little things: i.e. being walked to your room by the same person that checks you in, coffee being delivered 5 am along with the wake up call, I didn't do this to them but my friend ordered food from another hotel (Mandarin Oriental apparently best known for their hainanese chicken rice) and they ordered it for her, picked it up and only charged her for the food+ taxi fare  if on company expense (as I was last week) I'd definitely stay here again",5,,
"One of the best, but not for my visit",MLogsdon,"The Four Seasons is located just a block off Singapore's most famous retail trail, Orchard Road. The rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was massive and well decorated. The service was strong from my arrival to my room. The food was high quality and fairly standard. If I had to rate the property on the aforementioned alone it would be five stars.   Let me tell you where things went wrong. On the second night of three day stay, I woke up at 4am (jet lagged) to shower but the water did not work. I am a reasonably relaxed traveler so I returned to bed and figured I would shower later when the problem was resolved. At 7am I walked into the shower and turned on the water. For a moment nothing happened and I shrugged, just then black water shot out all over me.‚Ä¶",2,,
Excellent choice,theotherbob,"The hotel was able to accommodate us by giving us both an early check -in (11 am) and a late check-out (3 pm), which was really great, given our flight times.

(We had also considered the Shangri-la, but wanted something a little closer to town and within walking distance of the excellent MRT subway.)  Room comfort was excellent: clean, quiet, nice furnishings, beautiful view of the city.  The only thing missing was a hair dryer.

Uninspiring,rafoxdoc,"Quite disappointing.  I had a choice between Ritz and Four Season.  Since I stayed at the Ritz last year, I decided to try the Four Seasons this year.  For the same price, the Ritz is a much better deal.  The decor at the Four Seasons was completely uninspiring except for a rather garish orange and red center piece in the lobby.  The room was of a  5 star standard except for the rather thinning and greying bathrobes and the plain decor.  The breakfast was very ordinary.  I was given complimentary breakfasts by the booking agent.which I tried to trade  for some other services such as complimentary laundry or internet services, but to no avail.

The Hilton and Marriott appear to be lower grade.  I've stayed at the Shangri-La but it could not be compared to the Four Seasons.  I've considered the Fullerton but it's too far from Orchard.  If your prime destination is Ngee Ann City and all of the premier boutiques, nothing beats this hotel.

All the staff were constantly friendly and nothing was ever to much for them.  the front door staff know your name from the moment you arrive, and refuse to let you open the door for yourself.

The hotel's mattresses and pillows were so perfect and popular that the property actually offered them for sale!   The Four Seasons is centrally located and has considerable competition, but we were delighted with the respite we found.

Rooms were fairly large and a very nice bathroom with separate shower. Buffet breakfast( included in our package) was  nice, but one would get bored easily as the selection was the same every day. This FS is relatively small compared to the one in HK but I felt it is more cozy and really genuine warmth from the staff.

Can be better,DohaRgb,"When you hear the name Four Seasons, you expect a superb 5-star hotel. Four Seasons Singapore does not offer a big range of in-house dining. You need to leave the hotel to look for a varirty of restaurants. In general the Hotel is relatively small in size. ",2,,
Excellent Hotel - Great Service,Nicholas3003,"I've stayed at the FS for three days; business and leisure. The staff and service was absolutely excellent. Had a minor problem with the in-room safe in the beginning, but it was fixed wthin 10 minutes.  I had a corner room with a very big bathroom and everything was in perfect order.  Used the two pools on the roof and in the ""Club"", where you also can take a shower after you have already checked out. Nice service!  The location off Orchard Road is good, too. It is much more quiet than on the ""big"" road and so easy to access via the indoor link with the Hilton Hotel. You can find the link right between the bar and the restaurant.  Overall, a great stay and I can absolutely recommend to choose this hotel while being in Singapore. ",5,,
Great for a short stay,Grigs,"Up to the normal standards you would expect from the excellent four seasons chain.  Huge room, clean and well furnished.  Helpful staff and very efficient.  Wide choice at breakfast although service can be a little slow.   It feels very much like a business hotel though - but great for a short stay passing through. ",4,,
"A Good Choice, but Need to Know a Few Things...",Tommy0609,"My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in June 2007 in a Executive Floor Standard Room. A good hotel with all the virtues and amenities you would expect, but there are a few things a person should know before choosing the Four Seasons Singapore.  Check-in time: The check-in time is 3PM. This poses a bit of a problem for people arriving in early morning (as we did). Usually the hotel will try to arrange an early check-in, but when the hotel is busy, then this can be difficult. We had to wait a few hours, but the reception was very diligent in trying to take care of us.  Wear and tear: The rooms are quite nicely furnished (as you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel), but the hotel has fallen victim to the dreaded ""rattling air-conditioning/ventilation"" syndrome which occurs in older‚Ä¶",4,,
Our favourite hotel - the Four Season,heewee,"There are certain aspects about hotels that turn them from good to great. The Four Seasons is a great hotel, we are frequent visitors to Singapore and would not think about staying anywhere else. The welcome and check in are friendly and straightforward.

Expense Account Heaven ... (and an acceptable honeymoon venue),macintosh,"To date, all of my expense account visits at the SIN FS have been most satisfactory.  (Well, not one to complain, provided ""someone else,"" is paying.)  Given my supreme stature within my fine firm, the ""Superior"" (and on occasion, ""Deluxe"") room categories are for the taking.  They serve their purpose: convenient for work, broadband, king-size bed, and in-room massage treatments until 11 pm.  (Although, the Four Seasons Bangkok - my all-time favourite ""urban"" FS property - offers most relaxing in-room treatments until 2 am.)  Have always had the best times with business colleagues and new/old friends in the FS bar (""One-Ninety"").

"Unobstrusive service, good for the business traveller",Finlo,"I've stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel Singapore three times on business trips and always find it a calm, welcoming place to drop suitcase at the end of an 11 hour flight.

Very good but could be better,PSF2020,"This was the second time I stayed at this hotel for vacation with my wife and 2 kids.

Everything else was perfect and we were extremely happy with our stay.  It is because we sere so happy with our first experience that we came back and stayed for 5 nights.  Unfortunately our second visit was not as good as our first visit because the quality of their service had dropped significantly.

I stay here every single time I visit Singapore, and have never been disappointed.  The location on Orchard Blvd is ideal - it is much quieter than Orchard Road, but sacrifices very little in convenience and ease of access to it. The link to the Hilton Hotel (which is situated on Orchard Road) is a great added convenience in this respect. ",5,,
"Excellent hotel, but",Gary P,"This is a superb hotel. We stayed from 26th Oct - 30th Oct 2006. The staff cannot do enough for you. The rooms were spacious and catered for everything you would want. The pool and club lounge on the 3rd floor are a great way to chill out away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Try the spa.  I do have three things that annoyed me though.   First, the price of the water in the mini bar.  Second, I did not like the restaurant layout. Food is excellent but people can walk past you coming in from the shops or bar as there is only a small wall dividing the restaurant from the public area. The restaurant is not relaxing in anyway shape or form.  Third is nothing to do with the hotel but the guests. I know you pay for good service but I am fed up with people who think they are‚Ä¶",5,,

A nice desk for working BUT: They charge you 30 dollars for internet/day. Remember this is 2006. The price for the room is 500 sing dollars. Just stupid to charge extra for this basic service. (Pan-Pacific Hotel club rooms has this complimentery.)  A well filled mini-bar BUT: They charge you for those 1 liter water bottles outside the bar.

Superb experience,Cailean,"Stayed at The Four Seasons for three nights in April 2006. Have previously stayed at The Four Seasons in Las Vegas and Sydney so were confident of a good experience. As it was the last three nights of an eight week tour of Australasia we wanted to end the trip with a bit of style so arranged a limousin to pick us up from the airport(This was arranged via the hotel website). On arrival at the hotel about 10pm we were met at the car by the duty manager and our registration was processed quickly. We were then informed that as the hotel was extremely busy we were to be upgraded. In fact we were allocated the sleeping quarters of the Presidential Suite on the top floor.

Solid value for business travelers,beijau,"With something approaching three months of 2006 spent in Singapore hotels, I have learned a few things. Among them is that the Four Seasons offers business travelers what they need, full stop.  Most of my time in Singapore this year has been at the Fullerton Hotel for the sake of convenience. The fact is, after two stays, I prefer the Four Seasons hands down. I rate the 4S ""Above average"" relative to Singapore business hotels charging a corporate rate. The other comparable hotel in my mind is the Ritz Carlton, but once again, location can play a big factor in that choice.  Chances are that the Four Seasons's near-Orchard Road location is a cab ride away from where businesspeople work. Not so bad in the morning, but a bit more a struggle in the evening.

The Upgraded Experience,uryjm,"From the moment we checked in and were upgraded to an Executive Suite, we knew we were going to have a great stay at this hotel.

I could be a cynic about this and say it was twee, but they didn't have to take the trouble so I thought it was a genuine nice touch. The suite was excellent with all the mod cons you could want, although we had to ask someone to come and turn down the ice cold air conditioning as we couldn't work out how to do it. Someone arrived within minutes, and the hotel service was always prompt, friendly and efficient, if at sometimes it felt a bit over the top. The breakfast buffet offered a‚Ä¶",5,,

Previously we have stayed at the Fullerton, Raffles the plaza and the Intercontinental. We stayed here for 8 nights and hence I feel this makes us well placed to comment on this hotel.  A deluxe room at the four seasons was indeed far more expesnive than any of the other hotels I mentioned above  What this hotel does have going for it is exceptional service, up there with its compatriot the four seasons in Bangkok.

Excellet Hotel but some maintenance problems,MRIII,"My partner and I visited Singapore in late June and decided to test all the top luxury hotels.

ROOM We reserved the Deluxe Room on a higher floor. The room was very spacious with high ceilings and it was well appointed. There was a medium sized regular TV (not LCD TV), a DVD Player, a writing desk with Internet access, a sitting area with huge windows overlooking Orchard Road, a separate make-up table and controls by the bed to open the curtains. The room looked well maintained despite being over 16 years old - Something the Ritz Carlton Millenia should learn to do with their dated and‚Ä¶",5,,
Recommended,Oldbolter,"Stayed for a weeks holiday in a superior room in late June. Hotel room and service very, very good. Staff could not do enough to help. My wife needed to see a doctor while she was here (not serious and nothing to do with the hotel) and the staff did everything but carry her there themselves - lots of chocolates and fruit for several days afterwards plus staff check-ups. Pool and Club areas excellent with helpful and attentive staff. I would rate it excellent but for one ""gripe"" - the restaurants are a rip-off. Not a major problem though as there are numerous restaurants within a few minutes walk where you can get better food at half the price. Moral of the story is ""get out and sample the town"" and dont just be a hotel person. Overall - highly recommended. ",4,,
Excellent but.......,tundergarth,"Based on my experiences staying at five different Four Season's previously, the Singapore hotel falls a bit short. It is still a grand and excellently run hotel. However, the Premium room that I got was not up to other Four Season's standards and the view out the corner windows was quiite ugly at both views. I may be a bit picky, but as highly rated and as relatively expensive this hotel is, it should be perfect as, I found, was the case at the Four Season's in New York and Paris for instance. The policy of all Four Seasopn's of charging between $10 and $20 extra for high speed internet access is downright foolish on their part. Instead of charging $600 or $800. for a room, charge $610 or $810 and forgo the embarrassing surcharge for what should surely be part of the room rate. ",4,,
Great stay,bugsy12,"Stayed at the Four Seasons end of May in an executive suite. It was an amazing experience. Staff knew you by name and service was friendly. However, I think the  Mariott and Hyatt were closer to shops. To be fair, the Four Seasons was close to shops as well but you have to walk through a walkway to get to the shops and if you go late at night, the walkway was a little deserted.  Food was great - had the curry laksa and room service was fantastic. The rooms were also spacious, very new and had lovely tolietries. I liked the little touches that the Four Seasons had like being able to check in in your room and not queue up at reception which made the stay memorable. ",5,,
As good as it gets,toomanybeds,"I rarely enthuse about a hotel but this one breaks the mould. Not so much for its rooms and facilities, they are fine enough but replicated as well elsewhere. No, what makes this one different is the quality of service. The staff are the best trained and motivated I have ever encountered, I think. So few chains understand the need for this to ensure repeat business. Service is personalised, discreet and anticipatory. From the wakeup call to the concierge, the transition is flawless. The emphasis on safety is also very welcome. My only niggles are the constant fiddling with the room key, especially for the lift - time they went wireless - and the room safe is too small for a laptop. ",5,,
Excellent Hotel,LightPacker29291,"Got a last minute room here as all of singapores hotels were packed due to some aerospace convention. Had a suite that was very spacious and up to the usual 4 seasons standards.  This hotel is very swish...the reception staff look sharp in their suits and have communication devices to keep in touch with other staff whilst on the move.   The spa is excellent with free use of jacuzzi, steam room, suana etc. Two great outdoor swimming pools (one at spa level - about level 10?)...and one right at the top of the hotel.  This hotel is located just off the top end of orchard road and is linked by a strip of designer clothes shops to the Hilton.  I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. ",5,,
Four Seasons for Fabulousness,StephenIsleofMan_UK,"After the long flight from Christchurch NZ what bliss to arrive at the Four Seasons for a four-night stay.

Breakfast ordered for 0830 arrives at...0830 on the dot and what an inspired idea to be provided with a toaster - no rubbery cold toast here.

Four Seasons is not perfect,Nic N,"Although we stayed for only a night and found the service and facilities very good, there were just a few annoying things that marred our experience.

This I can forgive, but not what follows.  A week after returning home to UK, I received a letter and a bill to say that I had taken a pack of playing cards from the minibar, and they have debited S$11 against my credit card!!!  Not only had I not taken the cards, but I don't play cards, and I had no time in a short stay to play cards.  Would anyone in such a well appointed hotel be bored enough to play cards, I wonder!

Great Value for Luxury,ALKDVS,"We stayed here twice: several days in December and again in January. Both stays were really superb.

Excellent Hotel,Abbyx007,"Stayed for 5 nights from Dec 26th.   Got a suite and it was excellent.  In room check in, met at the door by reservations manager who remembered us from a prior visit.  Complimentary good red wine and another bottle when air con leaked a bit one day.   Extra half hour tennis time given because I complimented the room manager, free tea brought to my ailing daughter one evening when she had a bad tummy, front desk who tried hard to change an airline reservation for us, and on and on.   This is a hotel, not a resort.   People who stay at a hotel like this probably have a preference for toothbrush so should not expect one.   The tap water is fine and so bottled water is really not needed either.   These quibbles by other reviewers are for lesser hotels.  I will stay at this hotel‚Ä¶",5,,
"Very good, but room for improvement",KGB777,"I like this hotel, and am inclined to agree that the rooms and the decor are indeed the best I've seen in Singapore (although I haven't stayed at Raffles - slightly different price range!)  But there are a number of minor issues that could be addressed:  - Complimentary bottled water is standard in most 5 star hotels in Singapore, but not the 4 Seasons. - Complimentary toothbrushes are also fairly standard in Singapore, but not at the 4 Seasons. - Some daily chocolates are a nice gesture, absent in the 4 Seasons...  It's a good hotel, I'd stay there again, but I prefer Raffles The Plaza (which also is more convenient for the business traveller) ",4,,
Rough Stay,Trek11692,"Not my typical Four Seasons experience, the hotel was very busy when I stayed with them for 3 nights and the lobby was a complete chaotic mess when I checked in. There were more people hanging around the lobby than at the MRT station. I had the unpleasuring experience of dealing with Ms. Fairoza at the desk who tended to my check in inquiry regarding a non- smoking room and I can honestly tell you she may have been the rudest employee I have come across at any FS. 'No sir we dont have it, are you going to stay with us'.     I ordered breakfast through room service and received the wrong eggs, when I asked to have them replaced it took an additional 35 minutes.   All in all a nice hotel just small details.  Cheers ",2,,
Pleasant stay...but not stellar,Travel147,"Stayed here 2 nights and it was a pleasant stay. The service was generally excellent. The concierges provided some good nontouristy restaurant recomendations and helped us plan a day of sightseeing. The pool area was pleasant with good service. The room was typical Four Seasons, though it did seem smaller than their other locations. The only negative was the casual restaurant. It seemed to be just a step above a TGIFridays, and the service was not very polished. The bread was stale, and it took a long time to get food. At the breakfast buffet, used plates piled up on our table....never being cleared. The entertainment in the lounge was also very loud. However, these two negative would not turn me away from a future stay at this hotel....I just wouldn't eat here for dinner. ",4,,

We booked a weekend break which comes with breakfast and free tennis lessons. We arrived after the Sat lessons but the hotel arranged lessons on Sunday especially for us. The rooms are nce and specious but in some need of renovation. The breakfast is nice but not great. The pools are clean and relaxing.

Definitely THE Hotel in Singapore,Penguin,"Check this hotel out if you're going to singapore. It has a (four seasons typical) excellent service.

A hotel manager greeted us a t the car and took us directly to our room (be aware, as always they try to sell you an upgrade room first!). She took my credit card and passport data in the room and after two minutes we were checked in. The staff is attentive all the time (and doesn't bother you if you don't want).  We had a nice junior suite with a great view over the city. Orchad Road is only 2-3 minutes walk away - and there's also a train station.

Can't rate this hotel highly enough,AussieAnge,"From the moment we arrived - very early - till the time we left everything was sensational. Room, food, service - excellent.

The only downfall would be the rooftop pool, but you don't go to Singapore to lie beside a pool. ",5,,
High Quality,MikeCMelbourne,I probably cannot afford to pay for this hotel if I was on holiday on my own. Very nicely designed rooms. Large spacious toilets. Clean. Nothing much to complain actually except that the buffet breakfast should have a bit more selection and they should have provided free drinking water. Very good location . ,5,,
Excellent hotel,JAH123,"i visited during March 2005.  I liked Singapore much better than expected--the flowers and botanical garden are great.  The hotel location is very good.  the room was extremely nice and the Chinese restaurant was outstanding.  The concierges were extremely helpful with great restaurant recommendations.  Overall, among the top 10 hotels I have stayed at worldwide.  Two suggestions: (1) upgrade TVs to plasma.  The football games would be much better and (2) the breakfast buffet selection is not as good as many other top Asian hotels, e.g. the 4S in Shanghai or the Peninsula in Bangkok.  Over an extended stay, I like more variety for breakfast.  I will definitely be a repeat visitor! ",5,,
A great hotel!,surftraveler,"Outstanding in every respect.  I stayed here in March and again in April, first in a suite and then a deluxe room.  Both rooms were immaculate with excellent details, the service is tops in every respect, and the food was quite good as well.  I cannot imagine that there is a better place to stay in Singapore.

First Class Quality,fightinghippos10,"Everything about my weekend stay was first class.  The service throughout my stay was outstanding, and it all came at a good value.  I booked the Weekend Special package, which gave me a Deluxe Room (15th floor, non-smoking, kind bed, breakfast) for US$175/night.  This included a free hour on the golf simulator, too.  The room was immaculate, with a king bed, sofa, and work table.  They offered high-speed internet access, but declined to tell me (until I tried to connect) that it wasn't free.  This was the only disappointment of the stay.  TV options were wide, with over 30 channels including CNN and BBC.  The bathroom was excellent, stocked with L'Occitane products.  Double sink, separate tub and shower.  The shower itself was awesome; no low flow constraints here.  I chose the‚Ä¶",5,,
Faultless,AndyS1980,"I could not find one thing wrong with this hotel. You are treated like royalty, the staff are superb. The hotel is perfectly placed for a stroll into town. The restaurant in the hotel was pretty good value and the food was delicious. We only stayed one night on our way through to NZ but it gets 10 out of 10 on every count. ",5,,
"Perfect location, kid friendly",GrandTour20415,"Wonderful staff (even though they forgot -- despite several e-mails -- that out four year old would be with us).  Great location for shopping, food, and mass transit.  Elegant and kid-friendly at the same time.  A great value for the money. ",5,,
Excellent Property in Trendy Orchard Rd Area,stinger32,I stayed at the Four Seasons in Singapore from the 22nd to the 24th of October and thought it was a fantastic property.  I should start by saying it was my first time in Singapore and I have not stayed at any other properties there.  The service was impeccable from the moment my car pulled up in front of the the hotel until the time I was put in a car back to the airport.  Check-in was very fast and efficient and I was in a premium executive room with a king bed and nicely appointed marble bathroon with separate WC.  The room was very spacious and well decorated.  Bathroom was large with separate tub and glass enclosed shower area.  Restaurant on site was very good for breakfast which was included.  A nice range of food was offered from tradtional American type cuisine to Asian‚Ä¶,5,,
