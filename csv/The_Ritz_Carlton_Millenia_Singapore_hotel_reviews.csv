Very Bad experience,Benny L,"I am now staying at Ritz Carlton Singapore.   It is the first trip for me after COVID 19 and I have been looking forward to it, especially when I know that I would be staying at Ritz Carlton.  It has been a very disappointing experience since I checked in.  The first day when I checked in, I found a half drunk bottle of water in the room, which was disgusting.  Then  I found the 2 plugs next to my bed didn’t work. Later in the evening, I found all the phones in the room were out of order too. Since it was very late at night, I waited until the next morning.  The next day, I complaint to the hotel and the manger send a technician to fix the plugs but he couldn’t fix the phone. The technician said he would find someone to follow up,  After all my activities on 2nd day, I went back to my room and found the phones were still not working. I found no note in the room. I am not sure whether a technician ever came by or not. Even if he can fix it, I expect a note about it.  I then went to front desk to complaint, all I got was apologies, which I have got so manny these two days. The problem was not fixed.  I have a very bad experience.  This is not the Ritz Carlton that I expect,  Very disappointed.…",2,October 2022,Travelled on business
Just when I thought it couldn’t get better…,prince_of_roam,"Just when I thought it couldn’t get better…  Beyond being engulfed in complete luxury with all the usual amenities of a six-star hotel, the service quality was absolutely over the top!  The General Manager, Peter Mainguy arranged for me to have my favorite Marina Bay room with gorgeous views of the harbor.  A big thanks for accommodating my special request.    However, even more impressive was the service quality from the staff.  Noticing that I was using a pillow support for my neck, the thoughtful evening Butler had arranged for me to have a complimentary neck support memory foam pillow without my even asking.  This amazing attention to detail and the customers individual personal needs is really what sets the Ritz Carlton apart from other leading hotels.    Another key advantage for Ritz, is that they have a PCR clinic right next door.  Very convenient for travelers who need an immediate PCR test before departure.  Overall, one of the most consistently best rated across all categories.  I’ve stayed at the hotel over 18 years and they never fail to impress.  Having said ALL that, I WOULD prefer to see Ritz Carlton Milennia be able to allow #Bonvoy Members to earn points / nights for their stay.  That is currently the only thing missing from an otherwise perfect hotel choice.…",5,September 2022,Travelled on business
A fantastic Wedding Staycation,Bertram L,"I always choose Ritz Carlton, Millenia as my ideal staycation place. And now to celebrate with my wife after our  wedding, it wasn't a hard decision that we decided on it as our Wedding staycation.  Otw to the Hotel we weren't expecting much other than a good time to enjoy and relax. However during the check-in the front office lady  greeted us as Mr & Mrs which was a surreal feeling!! 😊😊😊 after the seamless check-in. We went up to the room straight away and lo and behold we were surprise at the amenities that was prepared meticulously and waiting for us!! Not long after we had a call from Chef Sundar congratulating us and telling us to enjoy the amenities.   On to the next day, we were surprise when the In-room dining called and said that they have prepared something for us for breakfast, it was such a nice gesture from the team. Before our Check out, i manage to reach out to Chef Sundar and thank him for the great hotel stay and experience. What i was also impress was when he said that it wasn't him alone but a group of people involve that made it happen. With his permission i took note of their  names, thus its only fitting that i should mentioned their names for creating such a enjoyable stay for us.  Thank you!!!   Chef Sundar, From RC Club  Elvy, Joan, Weileh. From Pastry!! My Mrs enjoyed the Carrot cake a lot!!  Carolyn, for the room amenities  Kate & Isabella, from In-Room dining  And everyone else who were helping as well!!

Honeymoon,Mark K,"We had a wonderful stay at the Ritz Carlton Millenia on our honeymoon. Amazing service from the warm arrival and congratulations from Dexter to the room upgrade to the stunning marina bay view.  Our flight was also delayed by 13 hours and we arrived the following morning - to our surprise, they adjusted our booking (without us asking!) removing one night from the charge.   They provided a lovely ‘cake’ made from watermelon as well with a thoughtful card - a perfect treat after our long flight.  Highly recommend!",5,October 2022,Travelled as a couple

Amazing hotel,Furry61,"I couldn’t fault the hotel at all. It was spotlessly clean and the breakfasts were great with lots of options on offer and delicious. The staff were super friendly, especially Adam at the concierge desk,  Kong, one of the door security guys and the Filipino maid who had just arrived in Singapore and serviced room 703.  I didn’t use the spa or gym but both looked amazing.   The pool opens at 7 am until 9 pm.  It’s very attractive and it was lovely swimming at night in a temperature of 29°C with no worries about getting burnt!   The hotel is well positioned within walking distance of Raffles and the iconic Marina Bay hotel.  I want to go back asap!",5,September 2022,Travelled solo
Not for milestone events,Grumpyz,"First, the hot water tap at the basin doesn’t work. It didn’t bother us then till the next day when the cold water tap start leaking and was creating a puddle at the basin.   I found out that there was a chip at the corner of the shower stall through the hard way, my toe got cut. It was impossible to bump into that corner due to its awkward angle but small parts of the chipped tiles were scattered over the floor and luckily it wasn’t my kids who got cut.   I arranged for some birthday decorations to put up in the room. While arranging the timing with the coordinator, I was informed that all occupants have to vacate the room. I asked if my kids could just stay in a corner and the coordinator repeated twice impatiently that all of occupants have to vacate the room. Ok, I got that message but the coordinator could have further explained nicely why there was a need to vacate the room. To her credit though, she was very accommodating when I had to change the timing several times as I had to find a time slot that my husband wasn’t the room as it’s meant to be a surprise and plus my spa appointment was messed up.   The decorations could use better scotch tape and maybe grade of helium gas?  The Happy Birthday banner dropped down after 10mins of us entering the room. We had to retrieve the letterings from the tight space behind the sofa. The balloons started sinking to the ground after 6 hours; Needless to say, my kids were looking forward to bring the balloons home to prolong the celebration; only to be disappointed.  In other celebrations where I had ordered balloons from other vendors, they stayed afloat for 12-24 hours. The decorations did look pretty when they were up but they weren’t worth the price tag that Ritz charges.  I called and booked a spa appointment for 5 Sep on 7 Aug  10.23am. To my horror and disappointment, they didn’t have any traces of my booking. I was informed that usually the schedule for the following month wouldn’t be out that early and their protocol is to take down details down and confirm the appointment nearer to the date.   Now, I have tried previously calling 1-2 weeks in advance only to be told they are fully booked.  So this time, I thought this time I will try calling almost a full month in advance; only to have them ‘lose’ my appointment details.   Doesn’t help that online booking is via email and they take a few days to reply. If Ritz is concerned with no-shows, perhaps it should look into guests using credit card details as a collateral like the Michelin starred restaurants.  The saving grace is the appointment is for myself and not for the birthday boy.   The Spa manager, Rosalind did call me thereafter to offer me a complimentary 60mins massage on another day. It’s a nice recovery gesture though it is inconvenient that I’ll have to return another day. I didn’t take up the offer in the end.  Their competitor next door decorated the room with personalised balloons without extra charges and provided a complimentary cake that could feed 6 guests when we stayed there for my son’s birthday a few months ago. We didn’t even make prior arrangements with the hotel, they just notice it was his birthday when we checked in.  Dickson from Guest Services was really patient as we played email ping pong, communicating on my reservation and the birthday decorations.  Michelle from the Club Lounge was sweet as always. The rest of the Club Lounge staff maintained their usual standards of service though it was sometimes slow as it was a full house. The chefs at the live cooking stations were extremely friendly and accommodating to special food requests. They took the initiative to engage guests.   And finally, we were informed that the bill would be emailed to us as we were encouraged by the staff to use the Express Checkout options. In the past, we would receive the e-bill 1-2 days after we checked out. We waited for almost 1 week and we finally had to email in to request for the e-bill.   We stay or dine at Ritz Carlton fairly regularly and this stay fell somewhat short.  We have a soft spot for Ritz, from having our wedding to the full month celebrations of my kids at Ritz. We are probably what Ritz might consider ‘regular regulars’ and not ‘VIP regulars’.   This time I specially chose to go with Ritz to celebrate my husband’s milestone birthday.   I didn’t bring this up during our stay as I didn’t want to spoil my husband’s birthday.  Would I return again, yes I would. But would I choose this hotel to celebrate milestone events, probably not.  The Ritz that I know, the one where their ladies and gentlemen use to pay attention to details, seems to no longer exist, unless maybe you  are a ‘VIP regular’, not just a ‘regular regular’.…",3,September 2022,Travelled with family
Short stay; expected more,George,"This was a quick, 1-night stay, where I landed in SG in the evening and departed first thing in the morning.  The property’s main lobby, etc, is mostly what you’d expect from a Ritz Carlton.  When checking in during the evening, there’s definitely a loud, lounge-y vibe.  My main goal was to get into the room, take a bath, and crash.  Unfortunately, 1) no bath salts were in the room - it took two calls and about 45-minutes to get them, vital time when you just want to crash.  Ended up foregoing the bath in the end.  And 2) just as I was about to finally crawl into bed, half the room’s power went out.  Yep, half of all lights, outlets, etc, just went dead.  So, that resulted in another 45-minutes, luggage shuffling, and 2 unexpected visitors.  While I’m grateful the electrical issue was addressed in under an hour, all in all, I ended up not getting to sleep until after midnight with a 4:45am wake up call.  Hard to feel super great about the experience when exhausted.  In fairness to the property --  it was a super short stay, the sheets were awesome, the room (electrical issues aside) was pretty good, and the gym looked great.…",3,September 2022,Travelled on business
Unresponsive,JessaLynn89,"I read JaneL’s review of RC’s wedding team (reviewed in Jul 21) and felt strongly that I should add on to her experience for the benefit of other wedding couples who are considering RC as a wedding venue.  You would expect professional and responsive service from any department or team from a self-proclaimed luxury hotel right? I’d reckon so. But based on my experience with RC, I think you will be in for a disappointment.   When I was planning my wedding with them, it was as if I was playing a “i-wonder-if-you-have-seen-my-email” game. I had to frequently send them weekly reminder emails to get their reply for quotations and package details. I once had to send them 3 reminders (or was it 4?) to seek information on the wedding package. And they don’t even send you an acknowledgment email. It got to a point where my husband and I concluded that they are simply not interested in us and we decided to drop the venue even though we like the ballroom very much. It was such a waste of time reaching out to them.…",1,February 2022,

You take a local taxi from the airport to your hotel hoping that you get the room earlier than the standard Check In time.  Magic happens the moment you arrive the hotel. You are greeted by a gentleman who already knows you, by name and knows that you have travelled on a night flight.   Another gentleman come to escort you inside the hotel but instead of taking you to the reception, he takes you straight to your room. Check in formalities are done in the room while your bags follow.   I am in my rooms in less than 5 mins of arriving at the hotel.

We will keep coming back every time we visit Singapore!,Mariana G,"There is always a danger that a past experience that was exceptional in every way can be marred when revisited.  You know the feeling when you walk into a hotel lobby and see things differently from the first time as it is not a new experience anymore? The eye is a little more critical, expectations have been built on from years of no travel and memories are embellished possibly enhancing what may not have been there before. Maybe it is the tired looking treatments that you don’t remember seeing before or the team that welcome you have lost their genuine enthusiasm, responses are duller.  Was the attention to detail and the preemptive response from everyone at the property generously imagined from the past visit?    I have experienced that feeling before and that is why my…",5,September 2022,Travelled as a couple

Perfect weekend staycation spot 💖,Tricia L,"When we planned this stay, we didn't tell anyone that we were newly weds. But we were treated so well by the staff, it made our experience a truly memorable one 😊  When we arrived at the reception an hour later than check-in, it was clear that the staff were busy and so we were expecting quite a wait. Our room wasn't ready at the moment but our receptionist Cally was quick to respond and that put us at ease at the start of our vacation. She offered us a nice time at the bar while waiting, where the Mr enjoyed a very fragrant pot of Pai Mu Tan Melon Tea (I highly recommend it!) and I had a nice chocolate tart and coffee.

All the club lounge staff have excellent manners and they were very helpful and were ready to look after us. Our special thanks to Chuckie and  Jithra  for their service. Some of the names for special mention are Fadullah, Aishya, Sathish, and the rest of the crew (sorry forgot your names) at the club lounge.

Downgraded from King to twin,jobes888,"Arriving at 10:00 PM on an intl’ flight only to get downgraded from a king to a twin due to an overbooking issue on their side.   They offered absolutely ZERO when they made the change. Then they capitulated to a free breakfast. I don’t want a free breakfast, I want the room I booked. You have absolutely no recourse when they pull this motel stunt on a late check in. Their total lack of concern on rectifying the  situation falls very short of the Ritz. Highly disappointed.

Rooms to absolutely avoid,listenwell,"A biz partner and myself stayed in two different rooms. One both facing the marina, so the more premium rooms, one would think. My room was therefore on the side of the elevator ducts. Between the room and the elevators there was a service station, so I was not even directly next to the elevators.   I could here the elevators railing up and down as if I were next to a subway. The other room was separated by one room from the elevators, same outcome.   Recommendation after a painful stay:  INSIST on a room at last 3 rooms off the elevators when booking. You will NOT get a good nights rest. the prices are steep, so getting a room with such noise pollution is unacceptable.

Afternoon tea at Republic,ECFoodNTravels,"We had a long awaited tête à tête over afternoon tea at Republic, Ritz Carlton. Of course everything was impeccable. Service was attentive, prompt and friendly. We chose Republic over Colony for afternoon tea because the menu seemed to have less “fusion” with local flavours. I like my afternoon tea fare to be an unadulterated English tea with proper sandwiches and scones (as much as possible, anyway).  The highlight, hands down, was the salmon pithivier with diced truffle mushrooms in a champagne sauce. It’s such a lovely little pie.  And anything with truffles and champagne can’t go wrong, can it?  As expected, the scones were nice and warm, but I honestly prefer mine on the more buttery and crumbly side.

Singapore's Pioneer Luxury Hotel,Christopher Leung,"Opened for business in the 90s, it was one of the original building/hotels built around the marina, it was and it still is one of the most prestigious hotels in Singapore.

It’s a large hotel, so the interior spaces are somewhat sprawling - must be over 100 tables in the restaurant, for example.

We booked a suite, which had an absolutely amazing view of the marina bay sands hotel and the whole area. And it was in a very clean condition.   There were some issues that should be mentioned which I hope the hotel should improve.   1. Concierge never answered any phone calls during our stay. We had to go all the way down stairs and ask.  2. Colony restaurant was great however when i called reception they told me I have to book and that there are no bookings for this whole month!

High Tea at the Ritz in Singapore,gregsW9866VM,"Bring a big hunger.  The experience launches with a glass of champagne (private label for the Ritz from the Barons de Rothschild) and five savory appetizers - our favorite was the dragon's beard (you'll understand when you see it) stuffed crustacean.  Then Hans, the crepe chef, prepares fresh crepes, plus there are on offer a large number (10?) of delicious small sweet bites which you get to eat as many as you wish.  Our favorite was the mango pudding.  The tiramisu was to die for - almost the best we ever had (but it's hard to beat the northern Italian competitor.)  Lots of little chocolates of different flavors and compositions.  Great service - they make you feel welcome, bring fresh plates, replenish the tea.

Worst stay I have ever experienced!,Bek Yao Boon,"We had booked a Club Deluxe Kallang Room with The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore from 25 – 26 June 2022, and it was a major disappointment.  This disappointment started the moment we were doing our check-in:  1) When we did our check-in at Level 3, our reservation details were not captured accurately in the system. The front desk associate informed us that our reservation was Grand Kallang Room, but the reservation which we paid for was for Club Deluxe Kallang Room. At the same time, the front desk associate checked if we would like a smoking room or non-smoking room, and we requested for a non-smoking room. After that, we were being ushered to the club lounge to complete our check-in.  2) At the club lounge, the staff presented to us our confirmation details, and we noted…",1,June 2022,

"Average stay, should have been better",trvkaki,"This was a 2 nites stay marred by housekeeping issues but since they were resolved by the Front Desk, I will not share the specifics here but kindly note that the rating excludes the housekeeping issues.  The room was of a great size with nice views and the bed was comfortable. The Front Desk was kind to accommodate an early check in.  However, there are 2 hardware issues that Ritz could work on. Firstly, during the stay the TV reception was fuzzy most of the time. This is quite disappointing for a hotel of Ritz standing but since we only found out during the first evening and don’t watch much TV, we just stayed put with the room.  Next, of note is the toilet bowl which rocks left to right. Yes, it literally swings like a rocking chair when seated on it. Even if you are not…",4,March 2022,Travelled with family
Wonderful and memorable 3D2N stay at Ritz Carlton,Angel LRL,My family and I had a splendid and wonderful 3D2N stay at Ritz Carlton. The service rendered was impeccable and I wish to commend Mr Dickson Soon especially for his approachable and very customer-oriented demeanour to ensure my family’s stay would be a memorable one since it was our maiden experience with Ritz. The marina bay view from our room was enthralling including the view from the bathroom through the octagonal window. The night view from both the room and octagonal window in the bathroom was needless to say. It was scenic and relaxing. My son was also very fascinated with the self-guided augmented reality of the hotel art tour due to the virtual 3D experiences.

At least the $700++ bay view remains unbroken…,Jerome,"We stayed 2 nights over the weekend.  The positives - the front office staff were genuinely welcoming and friendly; the Marina Bay view from the room and bathroom was breathtaking, you would have to be incredibly jaded to fault it; we were here to celebrate my spouse’s birthday, and a complimentary birthday cake awaited us in the room upon check-in (nice touch, pretty standard for this category of hotels, but I mentioned this so that I may reference it again later).  Then the negatives. Day 2, I personally informed the front desk for a 6 p.m. turndown service (indicated my preferences on a physical card which was placed in my room), but I returned at 8ish p.m. to realise it has not been done.

The entrance to the hotel were grand. Concierge at the entrance were very warm and pleasant, and attentive staff made sure the check-in process was smooth and straightforward. However, everything after that was when the stay started to go downhill.

ROOM – I was mockingly disappointed that they “only” upgraded me to a Club Marina (51SqM) but ah wells. The 51SqM felt much bigger than it is, especially with the distraction of the full length windows offering amazing views of the bay. An anniversary amenity was delivered to my room thereafter as well which was a nice touch.

We hope it will be helpful for your consideration before you decide to embark on your journey with them.

"Great hotel, perfect location",Duck T,"Amazing property, truly luxury experience  My room had an amazing view over Marina Bay, I did like a spacious bathroom and separate living area  Breakfast was absolutely indulgent (I nearly got lost in a breakfast room) The service was up to standards. I really liked when a housekeeper brought a mirror in my room noticing I left my straightener on a table (so it helped me to make my hair properly)  Wish I could come back though it was kind of upsetting to to get any Marriott Bonvoy points from my stay (still such privileges as a room upgrade were provided)",5,July 2020,

Anniversary Dinner - 🌊 Seafood Buffet @ Colony 🦐🦞🦀,JCX,"We go to Colony every year to celebrate our anniversary. This is the second year we have done so during COVID conditions. We must say that their pivoting from self-serve to ala carte buffet has really done wonders.  Their totally online menu was well described and with illustrative pictures showing the standard plating. You could also customise the order to your liking if the standard portion was not to your exact specifications.  This year, we had the added treat of it being on a weekend, thus, we got the usual excellent and snappy service along with their Seafood Buffet.  Starting off with The Ice Bar, the oysters were served on a bed of ice in sets of two and were extremely fresh. Then their selections of chilled prawns, crab, mussels and clams went very well with the…",5,July 2021,Travelled as a couple
Shame on you ritz-Carlton Singapore - Front Office,D D,"Unacceptable! Shame on you Ritz-Carlton Singapore, forced me to pay FULLY (21-days), in-advance just a night after my stay, which i find it strange since my neighbours mentioned they were not told to pay in advance at all.  Thereafter when the government announced that the SHN will be reduced to 14-days, Ritz-Carlton decided to withold my advance payments and have now blocked my email address, so I have no way of contacting them to retreive my payment,  Shame on you.",1,June 2021,
Happy Plans Make Happy Guests,Golfhiker,I had the opportunity to make a reservation today for my upcoming birthday and party.  We are frequent users of the hotel but today was special. In answer to my initial inquiry I received a detailed email response with several options for planning. The response was very quick and thorough.  So I called to make the reservation with Ms. Neah Guinto who had originally responded.  Her friendliness and efficiency would make anyone want to stay at the Ritz.  Thank you for streamlining the process.,5,June 2021,
Club Premier Suite,KiraYvonneLim,It was Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day so we were up for a short staycation again!  Ritz Carlton definitely lives up to its name & we had one of the best staycation.  The view was one of the best yet from the top and the pool was also one of the best for its size and flexibility. This is what you call hospitality.  Did I also mention in-room dining was good too?  Easily one of our top favourite hotel.,5,February 2021,Travelled with family
Simply amazing - Ritz Carlton Marina Bay Suite with Club Access,Wilfred T,"The Ritz Carlton Marina Bay Suite with Club Access is simply amazing. Will definitely want to be back again (and again, and again...).  [Positives] Everything which you can think of... Lounge is simply awesome.  [Negative] the only thing negative is probably the TV. It is kind of slow and I always have trouble switching channel. This is the 3rd time I am back in this property and I am still struggling. It seems that the remote control needs to be properly angled in order (in 1 particular way) for it to work.",5,May 2021,

Very spacious bathroom with two sinks, bathtub with the view of Suntec/City Hall area. Comfortable sheets for a well rested night, However, noted there were some moss on the exterior of the window but probably an area that can't be cleaned that frequently.  Check-in - greeted by the staff upon arrival and directed us to the check in counter immediately after the SafeEntry scanning. Very smooth process during check in without any delay.

Luxury at its best,Ric C,"There is a lot to like about the Ritz Carlton Millenia. It was billed as a six-star hotel when it first opened. 25 years on, it continues to impress with its exceptionally high standards of quality in every respect, especially in its service. You will see this on full display in every staff you meet. Those fine folks in the Club Lounge will even greet you by name while tending to your every need.   Go for the club experience and make time to try any one of their award-winning restaurants (from Colony to Summer Pavilion to Shiraishi – they are all best-in-class), and you will enjoy the six-star experience to the fullest.

Tbh, we’ve received better service from hotels of similar calibers as Ritz Carlton, and what we had received from the staffs during our stay this time was pretty much run of the mill.

I greatly appreciate elegant software so I can safely say it was first and foremost for the famed anticipatory guest service: “We are Ladies and Gentleman serving Ladies and Gentleman”- the motto suggested a refined warmth I admired.

"The Best Club Experience, impeccable service.",Jay P,"My friends and I booked a staycation at the Ritz-Carlton for a double birthday celebration. We originally booked a room at the club floor but was upgraded to a suite because of the special occasion.   Amazing views of Marina Bay, a gorgeous suite, and amazing customer service.  The Club Lounge had impeccable service, delectable bites, and delicious champagne. Special mention goes to Chuck and Casey at the Lounge, Naoki at the Front Desk,  as well as Ken at the Colony for looking after us.   Will definitely stay again.",5,March 2021,
Perfect stay - thanks so much,TheParrys,"Thanks Ritz Carlton for a delightful and memorable staycation. Had a girls weekend and we both commented how well trained all staff are. Now THIS is what customer service is all about.  Special thanks to Mahesh V for the amazing experience. From the moment I arrived, he had helped me with my suitcase from the taxi and asked if I was Miss Chin! Wow, how did he know that - I’m not famous. From his warm welcome to taking me downstairs to the front desk for check in, to explaining about how to enter the pool. I bumped into him several times during the stay and each time he remembered my name and was the most polite and welcoming. He even hand wrote a lovely note sent to my door to wish us a good stay! Talk about personalisation!   Ayaka at the front desk was most helpful and…",5,March 2021,
Amazing View and Wonderful Hospitality,Rindiarningsih,"My husband and I were there late February to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we all really enjoyed our stay and will definitely look forward to future stays at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia. The view from our room was picture perfect and we truly love it. I felt so welcomed by the warm hospitality of Vijay from Bell Desk, Ros Astika from Front Desk and Moon from Housekeeping. It was a wonderful first impression indeed. Thank you also to Nadhirah, Kevin and Murphy for overseeing the decorations in the room. Not forgetting the housekeeping team too, with their towel swan decor and lovely note. You all have made our stay a memorable one. We will certainly be back❤️ ",5,February 2021,

Staycation,Mark P,"Another staycation in Singapore, due to the ongoing pandemic beginning of 2021. Our choice this time was the Ritz Carlton here in the garden city. We stayed in a deluxe club suite and enjoyed the best view in town. There is no better view in Singapore than from a high floor of the Ritz Carlton. Our suite’s living room and bedroom faced the bay and on the bathroom side the city. The suite is spacious and comfortable. All rooms were nicely furnished with light wood what makes it bright and very cozy. The bathroom is big and a great place to start and end the day. Sitting in the bathtub next to the window became a habit every day.  The club lounge on the top floor is an absolute highlight. You sit enjoying the best scenery in town and sip a glass or more of their signature…",5,March 2021,

Christmas Staycation 2020,JAMEQ,"Had a 3D2N staycation in Ritz Carlton again following a pleasant staycation in Nov 2020.  As our stay was during Christmas period, it was a stress test for the hotel and we were glad that there wasn't any major service lapse and disappointment.  Our checking in was fortunately quite smooth just that we were curious about how the hotel managed the queue system as there was no recording of guest's name nor any physical queue at the temporary reception lobby area except for several groups of guests waiting around.  During the stay, we overheard from another unhappy guest at the Club Lounge that the queue was not in order ie late comers were being entertained and checked in earlier instead.  We also encountered this kind of lapses but in the Club Lounge whereby late comers got to…",4,December 2020,
A less than satisfactory experience,Gisten,"This is an overdue review as I am only allowed to post a subsequent review 3 months after my last review was published under TripAdvisor’s guidelines. So, after a wonderful and memorable stay over the Deepavali weekends, we immediately booked another 2-nights stay in the same Club Deluxe Marina room to spend our Christmas.  We had bathrobes issue during our previous stay. When we feedback to the Club Team back then, we were assured that guests’ preferences would always be updated in their data system for future stay experience. As such, we were actually expecting that the correct size bathrobes would already be ready in our room, after all it was only a month ago since we highlighted our bathrobe preference. To our disappointment, the bathrobes hung in our room were still the…",3,December 2020,
Best Memorable Stay!!,kianboont2017,"Ritz Carlton has always been one of the top choices for staycation that I have yet to try and I sure am glad that I did for my wedding anniversary! Try as you may but I can assure that the most critical guests will find it difficult to find any faults during their stay!  Before the check-in date, got an email from Mabel to welcome me, sending me all the relevant information including food menu etc. There was a bit of confusion during check-in (perhaps the only 1 area to improve during this period of renovation of the main lobby), as there was no signage to indicate that check-in was moved to level 1 instead of the usual level 3 due to renovation. Thereafter, there was only satisfaction and amazement throughout our stay. First of all, we were pleasantly surprised to be given an…",5,February 2021,

Brandon went out of his counter to pass us the room access card with a wide welcoming smile. Definitely made my day!   Room was clean & spacious. And the view was spectacular. Admiring the best view even before to bed and when we’re in the bathroom too! haha! It was indeed the best staycation in Singapore we’ve had.

Fantastic service and well maintained,yangstravels,"I booked a hotel room to celebrate my husband’s birthday. A twist of events, my sister stayed with my instead and my husband visited to hangout with us.  And the receptionist was super understanding of the situation.    Because I indicated it was my husband’s birthday in the reservation, they gave us a free upgrade from Kallang Room to the Marina Room! Needless to say, the view was amazing.  On top of that, they also prepared some desserts and a lovely card wishing him a happy birthday.  It was definitely very thoughtful. We (including the birthday boy) decided to order room service to enjoy the view and dessert and I must say, the room was extremely spacious to accommodate the movable table they brought up when they delivered room service; and the best part is that we could…",5,February 2021,

I would like to express my utmost gratitude to Izan for checking us in and giving a free upgrade to City View with late check out knowing it was our honeymoon.

Then proceeded to Shangri La all during the less busy weekdays.  The GR at Ritz was quite ok....  Park and Shangri la both arranged beautiful swan towel and a written card to congratulate us. Both offered special room upgrades, one gifted us a food platter and the other a chocolate cake.  At the Ritz premier suite , we got a small box of 4 chocolates quite tasty.. It was ok compared to the other 2 where we did not even stayed in their suites   Foodwise: The breakfast at Ritz was better, with in room service for breakfast included.

Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staffs at the front desk who were extremely friendly. Check in was a breeze! Lucille Ong (guest service agent) attended to us & she was truly amazing. My husband booked us the Elevated Kallang room but since it was my birthday, Lucille upgraded us to one of the room with the Marina Bay View & it was the best gift a first time mom could ever asked for not to mention the late check out to enjoy the room and the view was much appreciated as well.

Spectacular staycay marred by pool booking issue,Hburn10,"For the longest time, Ritz's Club's 5 meal presentations(!), free flow alcohol all day(!), and the Champagne Barons de Rothschild Ritz Reserve Brut / Rose have always occupied my staycation-obsessed brains. Time to find out!  PRICE- Club Escape @ $629++ for a Club Deluxe Kallang King/Twin = $740.33. So $1,480 for 2 rooms.  LOCATION – Located in the Marina Bay area, the property offers sheltered access to Marina Square, Suntec City, and Millenia Walk (and Raffles City Shopping Centre with a further walk). So plenty of wine, dine and spend options if you book a base room without breakfast (but why would you at the Ritz?).

The Ritz - Luxury and Service Unbeatable,Humphrey C,"With all the unpredictability of Covid, my wife and I decided to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary early with a Staycation at the Ritz. It was absolutely wonderful and beyond expectations.   This I have to thank the very creative Murphy Loh (Guest Relations Manager) and her team who accorded us such recognition and decorated the room, presented amenities delicious beyond anything I have experienced in the most luxurious hotels.   Though there were strict controls practiced, they were made seamless by the gracious and attentive ""Ladies and Gentlemen of The Ritz.""

To provide context, we booked a more premium room with both the Bay and Flyer views, with access to the Club Lounge on the 32 floor.

Extremely poor and disappointing service by a so-called 6-star hotel,Sg reviewer,"My husband chose the Ritz-Carlton for our 7th wedding anniversary because he felt that it would be a luxury treat to celebrate our special occasion.  However, I was solely disappointed with the level of service provided by a so-called 6 star hotel, right from the arrival of our staycation.  Firstly, the hotel is undergoing renovations and it was terribly noisy at the Level One check-in area. We were made to wait for quite some time before Jerrol served me at the check-in counter. He informed me that my booking does not come with breakfast, and that I'd have to pay $48++ per pax. I asked if he could give us the rate that comes with the room (as I wasn't aware that my husband booked the one that came without) and he just flatly said ""No"".

He was thoughtful and so so helpful in all our experiences at the pool.  The spa services were nice and friendly. Had a wonderful La Mer Miracle broth facial by Wendy.

And being a little bit of a wine snob I was very impressed by their beverage menu. With St Francis Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon (4+ on Vivino) and Barons de Rothschild champagne (+  rose champagne), really worth spending a little extra on the club Lounge!

No worries, high occupancy, I get it. But well, lets talk about the level of service.  Since we arrived late, didn't managed to make a pool booking so decided to walk in and try (in our swimsuit). It was about 7pm then. The attendant told us the next available timing is only at 8pm, no worries full I get it. Started booking for next day, and only 7am and 1pm is available. Alright 7am then! At this point in time which is around 7.10pm (after much rejections and apologies relating to pool booking), staff decided to check if we can use the pool now and guess what, we can! What amazed us more was that there were only 4 people im the pool when we entered, so…",3,November 2020,
Amazing meal at Colony,Jo Ng,"Went to Colony with a friend last night and it was my first “sit down” buffet. Colony never disappoints! Loved the food and even though we were seated, the staff (especially Jessica) kept checking up on us, making sure we have our food and drinks all the time. It was pretty crowded but the staff made us feel like we were the only guests there.  Would return for sure. Just like how the great John Marriott said “the way you do business is as important as the business that you do.” Good job, Ritz-Carlton!",5,November 2020,
Lunch Buffet at Colony,Jern Y,"My fiancée and I celebrated our anniversary at Colony on the 17th of Nov with a lunch buffet. We would like personally commend the team for the great food and service.

Luxury stay of excellent service,Gisten,"Stayed in a Club Deluxe Marina room for 2 nights and was wowed by the panoramic view of Marina Bay which overlooking the iconic Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, central commercial district, Fullerton Hotel and Singapore River. Room was big and comfortable. Had a wonderful time soaking in the big and deep bathtub while enjoying the beautiful view. The hotel truly goes for extra mile to make the guests happy and comfortable by providing a bath pillow, which I have yet to see one in other 5-stars hotels that I had stayed before. The only complaint would be there was only one hook in the whole bathroom, very often I had nowhere to hang my clothes but to put them on the vanity top.   The true gem of the hotel is the Club Team who has provided above and beyond service. A big…",5,November 2020,
Deepavali Weekend,JAMEQ,"Just had a 3D2N enjoyable staycation over the Deepavali weekend.  We hardly went out of the hotel as we could easily spend the whole day with quality time in the room with splendid marina bay view, enjoying the club lounge with pampering service from the team there and a relaxing dip in the secluded swimming pool that is surrounded by lush and beautiful landscape.  There is no major service lapse albeit few minor hiccups, we still enjoyed this stay very much.   We fully agree with and support the Ritz Carlton's tradition of proper dress code in the Club Lounge especially during Happy Hour which is a highlight of the day.  Though most of the guests have supported this, we could see few guests still wearing T-shirt/short with slippers and some times in bedroom slippers in the club…",5,November 2020,
The best hotel in Singapore,Jireh,"Room was big, as big as other hotel's Junior suites I'd say. Most of the staff were kind but I was really disappointed at laundry svc. A member of staff who received my call almost yelled at me because he thought I could speak Chinese which I can't.  I was really upset, but your manager, Mr.Heng, Douglas listened closely to my complaint and came up to my room to bring back my shirts. After getting back my shirts back, it was in much better condition.  I was very impressed because he could ask other staff to handle this issue but he didn't. I was going to write a complaint but Douglas changed my mind to write a compliment instead. Thank you for your great service. Other than that, room condition was good, and the marina view was amazing. I went to other hotels in Singapore but I…",5,September 2020,
You leave wanting to return,ryansg,"Highly recommend the Club Lounge for people who are on staycation.  The service, drinks and abundant delicious food easily made this the highlight of my stay.  GET CLUB LOUNGE ACCESS The lounge is on the 32 floor and you start and end your day with a view of Marina Bay and the the lush Gardens by the Bay.  I found the five meal presentations excellent in quality, and I loved the little local touches they put in their food. There was a pandan flavoured creme brulee, with coconut shavings and, I think, gula melaka.  The service was impeccable. I agree with a past review that the service was good and sincere. The little touches went beyond the service staff, but also extended to the people who clean your rooms. Turn-down service for example, included chocolates and placing slippers…",5,November 2020,

"Staycation - Attention to details, service could be better.",James,"My request for a late check-out was quickly denied.  I was allocated a room (Elevated Kallang) on the 30th floor which promises a really good view of Singapore from where the hotel is situated, regardless of its facing. The room is 51sqm (547sqft) with the view of the Singapore Sports Hub and the Kallang Precinct. The room also has a small walk-in wardrobe area, where I felt revealed the most of its age of the room/property.   A plush King bed that came with two bedside tables, with light and blind switches so that you could turn everything off right from the comfort of the bed. The alarm clock also featured a wireless charging function. The room uses two other mirrors to create an illusion that the room is spacier than what it already is.  The well-stocked pantry completed the…",4,October 2020,

Comfortable stay with excellent hospitality,ElatiorG,"I booked a Kallang room for staycation in Ritz- Carlton overlooking the Kallang river.   Even though the view is less phenomenal than the ones overlooking Marina Bay, I was still very impressed by the view and abundance natural lighting.  The room and bathroom is very spacious and clean.  Amazing view from the bathroom as well, which allows you to enjoy the view of the city while soaking in the bath.  Due to the COVID period, breakfast was served in-room.  Even though the quality of the food is not remarkable, the friendly hotel staffs' services did make up for it.  The services of the hotel staffs are friendly, attentive and outstanding.  I do see myself coming back in the future.",5,October 2020,
Staycation and proposal,Alex ho,The stay there was wonderful! The view from my room is fantastic. Superb cleanliness and also the high class room decor. What sets it apart was the hotel staff.

This was the second time we booked a club because we enjoyed our first visit here so much.   As it was our anniversary,we were upgraded to the highest level of the level which had killer views. Room was spacious eventhough is was a normal room. Housekeeping was impeccable and loved the extra touch of placing chocolates in their turn down service.     The club lounge experience was a hit and miss. Loved the fact that they created a personalised QR code for us.

Fabulous Staycation with the Ritz-Calton Club Level Experience,jeannaoh,"We had an amazing 2 days staycation at the 32nd floor, enjoyed all the personalized & exceptional services that comes with the Club Level Experience. It is worth every penny of it!!  We were lucky to have our rooms on the same floor, going to the Club Lounge was just a few steps away. Thus ""pigging out"" was easy, we got to enjoy 5 free culinary meals a day, with free flow beverages of choice, we hang out at the lounge most of the time. The view on the 32nd floor is the best in town, didn't realize the Singapore skyline is so beautiful.

Glad they say they are busy. Which is very good because the staff are doing an excellent job and hope this pandemic doesnt bring their spirits down.   A few things to take note, check in is now at level 1(or the basement) usually it is at level 3 or should i consider it the first floor coz thats where you the main lobby is if you come by car/taxi. Renovations are ongoing but not a big problem.  Room with the Singapore skyline is absoulutely breathtaking.

Superb location,Banerjees,"Since travelling is  not happening currently, we took a  staycation at the Ritz Carlton. The idea was to enjoy the Bayfront area . The Singapore skyline is at its best there and we had a wonderful time enjoying watching the sunrise and sunsets over the bayfront - Helix Bridge, Marina Bay Sands, Garden by the bay, Fullerton.. The location is great - it lets you explore Singapore wonderfully by foot. The  first evening  we did a full circle of the bayfront area . We set off for the Jubilee walking trail another  day. We went exploring Arab Street another day. The location is a foodie’s paradise too. We started with the Saturday lunch buffet at Ritz itself at their restaurant The Colony.

Best staycation,extacy2508,"Our family of 4 enjoyed our 3 days 2 nights staycation immensely. We booked the safari package and the kids were delighted with the treats and tent setup in the room. We would also like to commend Eve at the poolside. She was really conscientious in wiping down the deck chairs and offered to take pictures for our family. She was also really good with the kids and they loved interacting with her.   Breakfast was done really well and the food were fresh and delicious. The only disappointment was that they didn't offer any Asian options. Since there are many locals on staycation currently, I would urge the hotel to have a western and Asian option for the guests. Overall, I would love to return for another staycation soon.",5,September 2020,
Best in class for service,zackharry,I went for a stay-cation at Ritz Carlton last week end together with my wife and kids. We spent part of our afternoon at the pool and went for dinner at Colony in the evening. This is not the first time we were having dinner here but the first time we were staying for the night. And guess what? We will come back again! This hotel is great but this is its service which is impressive.

One of my Favourites,J Steiner,I was here on business for 2 weeks and I had such a pleasant experience. The service was friendly and very attentive. The decor of the hotel is very inviting and peaceful and the architecture allows so much sunlight throughout. The lobby bar is a fun and pleasant place to have drinks and hang out before eating a meal in or out of the hotel. The dining options are quite good too.

The 37th Birthday,Chinta Yanti,"Due to the current Covid19 situation, I decided to celebrate my birthday at The Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore. I had initially booked the Deluxe Marina Bay view room with the Club Lounge access. However, close to my check-in date, I realized they upgraded me to the Millenia Suite. That was a pleasant surprise but I know I still have got to see how the service would be like. Check-in was seamless - I had Naoki assisting me and even wished me an advance Happy Birthday. When I got to my room, I realized they had set it up with a note from the ladies & gentlemen of the Ritz Carlton Club, coupled with a plate of fruits and a box of chocolates. I note they had also remembered my preferences (from the last stay in August) i.e. more bottled water and an ice bucket to always be there.…",5,September 2020,

We went to the club lounge upon a late check out     with the Amex charge card entitlement. We went to the lounge only with the intention of getting some drinks and for our child to see how it looked like. We also brought our helper along and told Ewan once we arrived about it.

I will like to highlight the professionalism of all the staff at Ritz. I know it is tough being in the industry now in the midst of a pandemic.

I'd like to thank the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Ritz-Carlton Millenia, for always going the extra mile with kind gestures beyond our imagination.

Wonderful Club Escape Staycation,Globalfilmmaker,"We had a wondeful staycation at the Ritz. We booked a Kallang Club room to celebrate a special anniversary. We asked for a view of the Singapore Flyer, which apparently you can only see from a Club Premiere Suite. As the cost was almost double that of our room, we declined the paid upgrade. However, they gave us a wonderful corner room on the top floor that had a partial view of the flyer. Our two-year-old daughter was thrilled to lean in to see the big wheel. It is a very kid-friendly hotel. The service is really outstanding and warm. We had vegetarian requests and they made sure they catered to our needs. It was our first stay in a Ritz Carlton and definitely won’t be our last. It’s a top choice for special occasions as the staff truly know how to make guests feel special.",5,September 2020,

Great Support Staff,AsianPeregrinator,"By luck of the draw I was assigned to a room at the Ritz Carlton during my 14 days Singapore quarantine. Ritz Carlton continues to exhibit the same level of professionalism and service despite the rates being significantly cheaper than usual (the Singapore government has bought up a large share of these rooms for returnees to Singapore).  I want to thank Arul and Riri for their excellent support.  I had a problem with the room phone and they tried their best to address the issue despite not being able to come into the room.

Along with the usual selection of scones, cakes, cucumber sandwiches, there were chicken tandoori pita, ondeh ondeh and many other tasty and beautifully presented bites.   Scone was properly buttery and milky. Wish there was more of it. Really appreciate that they use clotted cream instead of whipped cream (like some other high teas). Particularly enjoyed the Strawberry Coconut Choux Puff - that thin (but bursting with flavour) sheet of strawberry on the puff... can Colony please put that into a cake, a mousse cup or something?

DMed my contact details on Instagram and waited, and they personally called to let me know that we can already book :) we booked the deluxe marina view room, and when we checked in, they upgraded us to a premier suite! How amazing!! The suite was spacious, and  has spectacular views, I couldn’t stop taking photos :) fancy, very fancy 💖 the colors in the suite are aesthetically pleasing, and the bed was sooo comfy! I wish we could’ve stayed one more night. The only thing I’m disappointed about, is the food. We ordered using the menu that was already there in the suite. But after a few minutes, we were informed that the items we ordered were…",5,July 2020,
Ritz Carlton Spa,Sawdust_2207,"The ritz Carlton spa was such a wonderful experience. From the beginning, we were greeted by the staff. Next we were ushered to a private area to filled up our details. The staff introduced themselves and made us feel really welcomed. I did a 90min hot lapis stone massage. I shared my concerns with my massage therapist (Rizkin) was very attentive to my areas of concern and spent more time helping  me to deal with the knot. As she massaged, she hit all the right spots and it was Super relaxing. She clearly knew what she was doing and ensured that I was good during the whole treatment. Wendy, the other massage therapist was great too. She helped my friend to relax And she also had a great experience.

Colony's Afternoon Tea Set is what we all need now.,Vinnie,"Ordered Colony's Afternoon Tea set for two and it arrived in 3 boxes, with the items packed neatly, in perfect condition and still chilled. How do you do that? Amazing.  The smell of truffle was so heavenly, and the desserts were a delightful visual treat. The cheesecake and berry tarts are the among the best I've had anywhere.  My wife and I loved everything and it was truly a mood-lifter while we are mostly confined to our homes in this period.   We'd planned another staycation. Unfortunately that's not going to happen now. But the afternoon tea set, so carefully prepared, brought back wonderful memories of our time at Ritz- Carlton. Thanks RC!   Definitely looking forward to returning to this place of of impeccable standards, where the attention to detail and quality is…",5,May 2020,
Wow! Perfect! My favorite hotel!,AddioP,"We’ve been hearing lots of wonderful stuffs about The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia. So we chose the perfect moment, our honeymoon, to experience a stay here.   We love to go on staycations as we work in hospitality industry.  We also enjoy the benefits, as we work at the company, but this is truly our own personal opinions and feelings! We were wowed as soon as we step foot there. It’s true what my friends, colleagues been saying. The service was flawless.  Very curious to how they managed it behind the scene.  We know certainly one lady, Murphy Loh, Guest Relations Manager was the one who planned extra surprises for us in the room. Thank you Murphy and team for arranging all of those delights!  Room was immaculate. On top of that, we also got a creative towel arrangement. Excellent…",5,February 2020,
One of my favourite Ritz-Carltons in the world,That guy from Wellington,"The hotel is very peaceful and quiet. Gorgeous view. First class service.

Wonderful Birthday Experience,DaGoh,"Spent my birthday with them before all this COVID19 situation started. It was a pleasant experience as they surprise us while we are away from our room with a birthday cake. Not only that, in the middle of the day, we actually have the housekeeping staff knocking on our door asking us if we need any extra sheets or bottled water. The in-room dining was also awesome! Me and partner were lazy to leave the room so we order in-room dining. They arrived pretty quickly and came quickly as well to clear up for us! 10/10 will go back after this whole COVID situation for a relaxing staycation.",5,March 2020,
Amazing!,Mskfan03,"This is an overdue review! Had a great experience in this hotel after checking out from another hotel. The price is a bit on a high side for a traveler like me, but it is indeed good to try some luxury hotel even once. And yes, it justifies what you paid for! From Service to that striking Lobby design! Will surely recommend!",5,May 2019,
Stand out service and convenient location,SpiceNSpruce,"Of the luxury hotels surrounding this area, Ritz Carlton is perhaps the ""grande dame"", with its sweeping lobby, striking art pieces (there's even a guided tour, if you're art savvy), and a Michelin-star restaurant.  The hotel is conveniently located and linked by a walkway to Millenia Walk, which also has an MRT stop, and another shopping centre (Marina Square).  I stayed here for a transit in early March, when the effects of COVID-19 were already felt in Singapore and it was less busy than usual.     The room is generously sized but rather plain and old-fashioned, with two prominent features which are the wall-to-wall panoramic window (it's a great view from a high floor, whether towards Marina Bay or Kallang district), and the octagonal window from the bathroom.  As for the…",5,March 2020,
Wonderful experience,Nga Weixiong,"As the current COVID 19 situation, my family could not go for a holiday. Hence, we pick a kid's staycation package with Ritz Carlton. The idea of having a tent in the room make me skeptical initially never thought my 4-year-old daughter actually enjoyed so much. I was also never expected the room is big enough to have a tent inside yet still have ample space for us to walk around and my daughter to run around. The next area is the toilet, where there is ample space as well for a big bathtub. At this point in time, staff morale could below where a lot of jobs could be uncertain. However, the staff there did not put on a long face while working among themselves, instead still very ready to serve the guest.

A Complete Prestige Experience!,Harry Morton,"My partner and I previously visited the Ritz Carlton Millenia in late 2017. We booked this hotel with the expectations of the luxurious hotel rooms displayed on the website. Upon arrival we were welcomed with exceptional service and of  which the hotel rooms displayed the exact expectations. With such an amazing first experience  we could not wait to return. As we were planning a holiday to the Maldives we were assured we would have to stay at least 3 nights, staff were able to arrange our stay with a beautiful Marina Bay View Club Room. The hotel features exquisite dining, spa, gymnasium, pool, conference and art installations. The main outstanding feature of the Ritz Carlton Millenia is their consistently impeccable service throughout the whole hotel.  The club staff create a…",5,March 2020,

A Very Pleasant Stay.,KevinKSY,"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in October 2019.  - Service was exceptional. The check-in process was smooth.  - It was drizzling during the check-in. One of the concierge staff noticed I was carrying a shirt and took a plastic cover to cover the shirt to avoid it getting wet. I was pleasantly surprised by his attentiveness and initiative.   - The pool attendant (I didn't catch his name) was extremely attentive to the needs of the pool users,  - The slight hiccup happened when I had to wait for 45 mins to 1 hour for the room to be ready.   I had previously stayed at the Ritz Carlton and have experienced service standards that were wide. In this recent visit, it was extremely pleasant and I appreciate the good work by the ladies and gentlemen at the hotel.",5,October 2019,
Exceeded all expectations,RachelMcC,"Due to a very early flight, we arrived at the hotel early in the morning, expecting to be told to wait until normal check-in time. Instead, we were welcomed and offered not only an early check-in, but a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was a great treat. We were checked in by Fabio, who took the time to find out what we hoped to see & do in Singapore and then gave us some insider tips, including writing out a list of local foods he thought we'd enjoy (his best tip: download the Grab app, which is like a version of Uber - efficient, reliable and much cheaper than taxis). The room was really spacious and well-appointed with everything we needed. The views in both directions were breathtaking - the bedroom and lounge overlooked the marina whilst the bathroom overlooked the…",5,March 2020,
Staycation for the kids!,Joycelyn K,"It was the March school holidays and travelling out of Singapore wasn't an option. Hence we did a staycation in The Ritz Carlton! Upon arrival at the driveway, my family and I were greeted and whisked up to our room for check-in. I was delighted to know that we were given a complimentary upgrade to a premier suite and what's more, a Marina view room! The team at The Ritz Carlton had a tent set up for the kids and it was amazing! This came with kids amenities as well and it kept the kids excited and busy for a few hours!

"Expectations not met, not as good as other Ritz Carlton hotels",Ken Ip,"I had very high expectations for Ritz Carlton hotels having stayed in the ones in Osaka and Tokyo.  However I found the Singapore one lacking in service.  At the time of my check in I stood in front of the check in desk with no one acknowledging me.  That was not a good start.  And unlike in Japan where I was warmly welcome, I didn't feel I received a warm greeting at all even considering the difference in culture.  The room wasn't as luxurious as the Ritz in Osaka or Tokyo but it was bigger with big round windows even in the bathroom.  I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel but had coffee and snack in the lobby lounge.  Again the service was not very attentive.  I had trouble getting the waiting staff's attention for water and coffee refills.  The Ritz Carlton Singapore did not…",4,January 2020,
Amazing Lunch at Summer Pavilion,Ryan D,"Had lunch with a group of guy friends at Summer Pavilion (one of the hotel's restaurants) on Valentine's Day. Funny, and coincidentally, enough that those of us who had partners were all free, but our wives were working. I've dined at the restaurant a few times now, but I'm still impressed every time I visit. It certainly deserves the Michelin Star which has been awarded to it for a few years now, and I firmly believe it serves the best Cantonese cuisine in all of Singapore. The food is such a satisfying gastronomic experience, and the service is always impeccable. When you do visit, which you definitely should, I recommend ordering a variety of dim sum and also the Peking Duck.",5,February 2020,

Chinese cuisine at its finest!,Amazing Grass,"Had the opportunity to pop by Ritz Carlton once more, this time for dinner at the Michelin-starred Summer Pavilion. We thoroughly enjoyed the soups, which must have required so much skill and effort to prepare, as it was so full-bodied and did not taste like much/any seasoning had to be added at all. The London duck was so aromatic and moist, it's probably the best thing I'm going to have tasted in 2020. I usually scrape all the fats off duck skin, but I ate every bit of this duck, including the fats and it wasn't greasy at all.   Service, as always, was impeccable.

"Seemingly ""common"" dishes elevated to ""wow""",JoeIIe,"Visited their restaurant Summer Pavilion for a family dinner last weekend. Specially enjoyed the deep fried beancurd with spicy salt, drunken prawns and hor fun - dishes common in Chinese restaurants but done so much better here. The skin of the beancurd was crispy and umami-ish (addictive!). The prawns were needless to say, super fresh, and very good without the need for any sauce. Table side service for the prawns was interesting as we watched the cook Siat Yin deftly flambé the prawns. The hor fun had so much wok hei that my mum and I would be happy to just have kway teow on its own.  Would like to thank our server Siew Kee, for her very attentive and cheerful service.

Always good,Kuma K,"I had a chance to be at Ritz SG again. Although there was some miscommunication about my upgraded room but everything went well.  I met a staff, Gee Sing, who escorted me from the limo to the room and a new upgraded room too. He was a nice man, explained everything to me clearly. He was very good.  About the room, i felt that it is dated and hope that Ritz SG will renovate the rooms soon. If the rooms were still in this condition, it couldn’t be compared to newly renovated Raffles or even still new Fullerton Bay.  The buffet at Colony was also great. I could say it was one of the best dinner buffet in town.  See you again next time Ritz SG.  ",5,February 2020,

Stealing money,Steve K,I had a 3 day scheduled in october 2019. Due to Pasport issues when flying thru Manilla our group was not able to stay in the hotel. We canceled more than 36 hours prior to check in. The Hotel said they have a 48 hour cancelation policy. Looking on line there is NO such policy listed either on The Hotel site or Expedia. The room rate was to be $500 per night. They kept $1008 of my dollars and would not return the money. I have fought with Expedia and the Hotel for 3 months. I am stil out $1008 for a trip that was canceled properly. I would not use this hotel. BE very wary of using this Ritz Carlton hotel.,1,October 2019,

We were upgraded upon check in and although I booked a room with a view it was more than I could have imagined. The look out over the city from the corner suite cannot be beat.

Amazing,Hangry Forker,"Actually visited in Feb 2019 but the service was amazing, location super convenient, and rooms as you would expect above standard. The pool fantastic also. The restaurant very over priced considering you can hop across the road to the hawkers and get the same food for pennies compared to pounds, but a top choice for anyone who wants to stay in a bit of luxury. A short walk from the shopping centres it’s in a great location. I’d recommend anyone going to look out for the electric scooters you can pick up and pay on your mobile for, they’re everywhere and make seeing Singapore a breeze. We used them to go from hawker to hawker lol... the hawker food by the way is nothing to worry about, cleanliness standards are high, so give it a go and dig in!",5,March 2019,

Aira made sure that I had a quiet room and also arranged a late check-out for me.  The rooms are large, elegant and everything works well - with a comfortable bed, good lighting, excellent wifi and connectivity as well as great views over the city.

Exceptional service at the Colony Bakery,Michelle L,"I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia on business more than a decade ago and was impressed by the superb service the staff provided to me during my stay (especially the lobby staff who rushed out of the car and greeted me upon arrival - they made me feel like a celebrity). I have also dined at their restaurants on many occasions since then throughout the years. This time, even though I was not a hotel guest, I made a call to the Colony Bakery earlier this evening since I wanted to send a gift hamper to my Singaporean friend before I fly out of Singapore tomorrow morning.  It was getting late and I knew my chances were very slim. I spoke to Ms SoJin who informed me that they were not doing hampers anymore but after hearing my situation, she went out of way to accommodate my…",5,January 2020,

Best View in Town - Great Property,byairorsea,"We just stayed here for 3 days in mid-January.  Found our VIEW to be incredible - the city skyline, the bay, and Marina Bay Sands, all from our window.  That means we saw the evening light-show in the bay, saw ships in the bay and distant harbor as well as the skyline.  Incredible room, staff, huge breakfast buffet as well.  Ms. Sandrine Qu in bar-lounge was most personable and helpful as well.  Everyone was so cordial and helpful - wonderful!  The breakfast buffet was vast with ""western, Asian, Singapore cuisine "" choices - many items made while you wait.  Hotel was very convenient to walk, taxi, hop-on-off, transportation and only 20 min. from the airport.  Gardens By The Bay and good shopping near by.  Our corner room was huge.  Loved it and will stay again.",5,January 2020,
Amazing stay,Leion_909,"Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore is a beautiful luxury hotel and I think it’s the go-to hotel when staying in Singapore Marina area.  To enjoy it’s excellent location, book a room from the Marina side and you won’t be disappointed.  The views are to die for. The rooms are spacious and I really love the minimalist decor, with a touch of classic luxury. The design reminds me of Japanese or Finnish minimalist design.   When booking a Club room, you get to enjoy all typical Lounge benefits. However, Ritz Carlton has taken their  lounge game to another level.  They do the usual five servings, as you would expect, but after the closing time, guest can use the lounge kitchen area and bring food and drinks to their rooms. But be warned, you don’t really want to leave the hotel and…",5,January 2020,
Excellent stay,GunjanAggarwal,We stayed here in December 2019. Had an exceptional stay. We had the club room that was really good. The location is good. Their service is par excellence.

Service Atittude at its Peak,Kok Wah L,"It was not the famous brand we all know and yearn to host our staycays there but their service.  I would like to mention Ms Nia Masinta & Ms Lauren Chong for making my staycation a comfortable experience and not just only one cake but 2 cakes for myself and my godsister whom I share same date in January, to us that is way beyond our expectations.   They obliterate any staff I have encountered in my past hotel stacyations and I mean it. I can say this and again that you should book RCS to exeperience their services and although there may be times when service seems not just right for others, I would like to emphasize that it is really their service attitude that sets RCS apart from any 6 star hotel in Singapore.  They are aware I am deaf so they actually plan how we can…",5,January 2020,
Top of the top,jenn56,"It was my first time staying at Ritz Carlton. I was very surprised how nice all the staff were. When we went to pool just to check out, one of the pool staff gave us a little tour and took picture for us. The room was very nice. Great view with MBS and tiny merlion. We booked club room which was great idea. Food at the club lounge was on point. They had different menu everyday. I didn't not have dinner which I'm very much regret. However there was couple issues. You could hear someone begging door and talking the hole way all night long. Also the other night, house keeper came by around midnight and delivered blanket which we didn't not order. Although we told him that we didn't order it, he asked to open door. It was little bit creepy.  Other than that, we had great time.",4,January 2020,
Terrific Professional Hotel,Derek W,"We had been on a cruise from Dubai and decided to stay in Singapore for three days.

Good service,Lourdesdaisy,The main benefit to this hotel is the staff.  Every member of the team appeared keen to make sure my wife and I were happy.  The food is good and if you like exercise there is an excellent gym.  Our only issue is the building work.  We encountered on two evenings building work noise.  On our last night we had to call reception at 2.30am to complain.  The noise did stop soon after but for a 5 star hotel I don’t really expect to be kept awake at night.,4,January 2020,
The most wonderful stay,Shamsi A,"My husband and I had the most wonderful stay at the Ritz Carlton Millenia. From the moment we arrived, we were received warmly by Kevin and Brandon at the Front Desk. We had an early flight in Singapore and had arrived at 7 am. Kevin let us know our room was ready and gave us a complimentary early check-in, which was so immensely helpful after a long journey. And on top of that, because we were celebrating a special occasion, we got a room upgrade! This was our first time in Singapore and it was the best welcome!  The hotel is perfectly situated with the best view of Marina Bay. It’s a quick way to all the attractions around the area. Our room had the most amazing view of the Bay.   The access to the club lounge was definitely worth it. The food served all day was wonderful. And…",5,January 2020,
Second Memorable Stay At The Ritz,SharminN,"The Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore, proved to be an amazing experience even the second time around. I was there on a business trip but extended my trip for shopping and sightseeing as well. It was from December 10-13, 2019. The entire hotel seemed liked a Christmas wonderland, beginning from the huge Christmas tree at the entrance to the several nutcrackers placed in the restaurant and lobby areas. The Christmas goodies on sale were a true delight and I even carried a lot of it back home with me. This time I was booked in a Marina room and the view was breathtaking, the photos don’t do justice on how wonderful the view was at all times. The Ritz by all means is a class apart, they had extensive renovations going on, on some floors but not the slightest hindrance or discomfort…",5,December 2019,

We arrived from Bali from the Ritz-Carlton Reserve (see review).  Check in is swift and carried out on the Club Lounge level. Tina was so helpful and informative.  We had a corner suite which was beautiful. The interior is sleek and exquisite. The views from our room were incredible we could see the harbour, and the Singapore flyer, we could watch the Spectra light and water show from the comfort of our room.

Impressive,The Doc,"Very nice atmosphere and helpful staff. Rooms are spacious and full with amenities. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. The gym facilities were top notch. Spa was what you would expect from such a decent place, not the best though. Location was superb. Two tips: First, get the rooms facing the Marina Bay Sands, what a view. Second, avoid the rooms facing the service doors as they can get a bit noisy sometimes.",5,January 2020,

Pure luxury,Jtravel,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay. We were met by a lovely gentleman out the front of the hotel who took us up to the Club Lounge and settled us in.  I’m so disappointed I can’t remember his name.  Unlike us, he remembered our names and had a chat each time we arrived and left the hotel- very impressive. We were checked in early and given a room on the same level as the Club Lounge.  I was concerned that the room might have been a bit noisy as it was directly opposite the lounge.  I am a very light sleeper!  I asked if it was possible to be moved to a quieter area of the hotel.  We were allocated a beautiful room one floor down later that afternoon. It was very quiet, no noise from neighbours or plumbing from other rooms. Bed are very comfortable and linen of a high quality. …",5,April 2019,
Magnificent... but some problems with the staff for the Grand Prix week-end,SteveSavatte,"This property is incredibly well located and the view from the room is incredibly beautiful. The breakfast buffet may be the best I've ever seen, though I didn't sample the restaurants for other meals. My room was delightful - I could have spent hours gazing out the window at the city. My only complaint was the staff at the front desk who didn't seem able to answer my questions or solve the minor problems I had. Perhaps they were a bit inexperienced and just overwhelmed by the activity of the race week-end, but things didn't get done quickly enough, and some of the requests I made took hours to be honoured. A shame... But I would definitely go back.",5,September 2019,

Amazing Experience,Trachus,"I stayed almost a week in this beautiful property as my wife, given the nature of her work had to visit the Singapore Office.  The hotel is stunning and very clean. We enjoyed the breakfast room very much. As Europeans we found it somehow extraordinary. It is not only the design and the presentation of the buffets, but the food was delicious - outstanding. I was looking forward to this stay and I convinced my wife to book this particular property. Being a hotelier myself I was looking for nothing more than extraordinary to experience.

"Ruined my business trip, my loyalty to the RC ends here",aceboy44,"I stayed in this hotel for my 12 day business trip in Singapore. Where do I start?  My loyalty to the RC brand was not appreciated. First, different staff gave me different responses. An example would be one staff member would say Halal food is unavailable in the resort while another staff says that Halal food is available at the property. After a long day at work I think I deserve a Halal meal in my room when I stay at a luxury hotel rather than having to go outside myself to find a Halal dish. Is this howl you treat your loyal guests?

Christmas Cracker,DavidStrachan,This was our families first visit to this hotel having stayed frequently at other hotels in the Suntec area of Singapore. Our room was the best that we have enjoyed in this part of singapore and the view from the bathtub each day was amazing as you look over the city. Each day we had an enjoyable breakfast even though the restaurant was busy with it being the holiday season. My wife and daughter also had spa treatments and although the price was expensive they both thoroughly enjoyed the spa experience.

They should take it off the app don’t be half way a part of something that people are part of and then we are traveling and booking trips and didn’t look at details!

Disappointing - not for demanding guests,Santuza B,"We booked Ritz-Carlton through AMEX services and arrived after an amazing experience with Park Hyatt Shanghai and Raffles Siem Reap, so we were expecting the same level of hospitality experience. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a very disappointing experience.  Because we were in Singapore during New Year’s we had the impression that the hotel was like a low category Disney resort during high season, from lines to get elevators to breakfast placed on a ballroom on 1st January it all felt like group traveling. Breakfast was like attending a very busy business conference - everything that we did not want during a family holiday.

The food was one of the best I have experience in a chain hotel.

We absolutely adored Andrew & Satha our room attendants who took care of things beyond our expectations.  In fact, the second night, we found they realized my husband wouldn't fit the standard hotel slippers and located a very large pair which they positioned next to his very large shoes in order to demonstrate a size match.

We have to admit that each time we return for our anniversary celebration, Ritz Carlton has always up their game, never ceasing to amaze us with the warmest of welcome and the most heartfelt sincerity to take care of all their guests.   We certainly are very touched to tears at the Ritz Carlton team's effort and sincerity. Initially we were caught off guard by an unexpected renovation which disrupted wedding anniversary celebration and long awaited break from the daily grind of new life as parents. But the team responded very quickly to save the day.   I especially thank the MoD Naki San, who immediately offered an…",5,December 2019,

Family holiday,Eugene_Seddon,"Stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 2 nights and cannot emphasis the phenomenal experience staying here. From the time we arrived at the door to the time we left, our stay was the best I've experienced anywhere in the world (I have traveled and stayed in 11 countries). The Ritz-Carlton had everything that we needed as a family. A fantastic room, great amenities, facilities, service and staff. The housekeeping staff were amazing. The room was always neat and tidy and they even put a tent in our room as our two young boys wanted to go ""camping"". Thanks to those from the housekeeping team—Eric, Analyn, Sterlan and Shi Ying—for making sure we had a comfortable stay. The Colony restaurant where we had breakfast was the best breakfast bar imaginable. I would return to the Ritz-Carlton just…",5,December 2019,

Great experience here with family,Ong,"I stayed here with my parents for 2 nights, and I’ve got a really phenomenal experience here. As it was a short stay, the one thing that really made a difference was the housekeeping service—in addition to the nice view. The room was always neat and tidy, the teabags replenished, and the toilet clean when we returned. And they always anticipated our needs. Thanks to those from the housekeeping team—Eric, Analyn and Shi Ying—for making sure we had a comfortable stay. On the last day, we had a wonderful lunch spread, with the cuisine ranging from north Indian to Chinese to European and more.

Outstanding Services,D C,"For many years we stayed staycation annually at Ritz Carlton to enjoy the festive mood, we were never disappointed with the high standard of quality and services provided by Ritz including its restaurant - The Colony. This year we were checked in by Assistant Front Desk Manager, Evan Chiang.... he set our holiday in high spirit by his friendliness and efforts to made our stay as pleasant as possible.

Afternoon Tea Buffet - Great! 💪🏻,Benjamin Y.,"On the 24th of Nov 2019, I brought my family to Ritz Carlton for High Tea to celebrate my mother’s belated birthday! The hotel looked really beautiful and luxurious and we had an excellent time. We were first greeted by the warm smiles of the team at the main door who kindly directed us to where the high tea was at. The soothing music by the live band present there really helped set the mood for a wholesome birthday tea celebration with the family. The food that was available to us was of premium quality and taste but we felt that there could have been more variety - most of the things present were too sweet for our liking. However, our experience could not have been better if not for the professionalism and service of your staff, in particular, Janice.  Janice was always…",5,November 2019,

Luxury and great location,Terril64,"We stayed 3 days after scuba diving in Indonesia. The hotel has the luxurious feel you’d expect from a Ritz Carlton, and for us, the price was reasonable. The room was large, with a huge bathroom and both rooms had stunning views of the Singapore skyline. I did not use the spa. There are several restaurants inside the hotel. We only ate there twice, since there are so many places in this great food city. The main reason we’d return is the staff who are genuinely friendly, helpful, and upbeat. In particular we liked Michelle at the bar, who was talented as well as being sweet. But all the staff we encountered made us feel special.",5,December 2019,
Incredible Service (and breakfast buffet),470georgek,"Right from the start the Ritz Carlton Millenia provided an exceptional experience.  A staff member (Sarahfina) met me at the door, was expecting me, and took me directly to my room and gave me a short tour since the room had a lot of features (primarily how to close the blinds for the really large windows).  Everything was exceptionally clean, and whenever I needed anything (later or earlier room make-up time, refreshments at the pool, help with a key) everyone was eager to help.  The breakfast buffet was huge, with food from American and European style breakfasts as well as several Asian cuisines.  You could eat enough to keep you going for a full day (but don't, because there's a lot of great food to be eaten in Singapore).  The pool was big enough (25m) to swim laps but fancy…",5,December 2019,
Exceptional!,sjl_01,We were at the ritz for a stay with two young children. Service was exceptional from the very get go.

Deepak, Phil, Liz, and Elena also we’re so attentive, welcoming, and warm and brought me treats and made my stay great!     Chefs Daric, Han, and Kelly prepared special dishes for me to try, which were so delicious and beautifully put together!

"Incredible, amazing trip",Kate M,"My partner was out in Singapore on business and as we had just got engaged we thought it would be nice if I went out to join him for a week of it and I am so glad I did. After a tiny issue at the start, the hotel could not have been more welcoming, friendly and kind to us. I particularly have to mention the Club Lounge which was the perfect place for us to spend time and I have to give a special mention to Danny who took care of us everyday and made our trip even more special because of it. We now can’t wait to come back.  Kate",5,November 2019,
Amazing Views of Marina Bay,MG2146,"We visited the Ritz on our honeymoon and were blown away by how nice this property was. The rooms are bright and very large, and the panoramic view of the Marina Bay was absolutely breathtaking. The bed was extremely comfortable with great pillows. The room was quiet and the curtains were fully blackout which made for a great night sleep. And the bathroom was just out of this world, especially with the amazing bathtub overlooking the marina. The lobby is beautiful; it feels very warm and welcoming and the restaurant has a very cool geometric design. The location was very good and walking distance to the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands. All in all, I thought this property was much nicer than the Ritz Carlton hotels in my hometown of Southern California. Highly recommend.",5,November 2019,
First visit to Singapore in the Best Hotel,Mina,"I stayed for five nights at Ritz and it was my first visit to Singapore.  The hotel was very nice when I checked in and the lady who helped me check in was awesome.Her name is (if my memory is correct) ASIKA (if the spelling is wrong, forgive m).  I really want to let the hotel know her attitude towards guests( warm welcoming and sweet) And all the staff at the lobby were very nice and kind.  I really intend to stay here when I come back to SG anytime.  싱가포르 첫 출장 방문이었는데 호텔이 너무 환대해줘서 기분이 좋았습니다. 체크인 시 도와주신 아시카 님 너무 감사하고 높은 층으로 주셔서 좋았고요. 객실도 크고 욕실은 더욱 좋고. 다만 객실 바닥의 청소 상태는 자국도 있고 맨발로 다니기에는 좀 꺼림직했지만 슬리퍼가 있으니 괜찮았습니다.  택시도 손쉽게 잡을 수 있고 마주칠때마다 뭐 도와줄게 없는지 묻는 스태프들의 태도에 감동받았습니다. 다시 싱가포르를 간다면 또 다시 묶고 싶습니다.",5,December 2019,

Superb,Denise25203,"Our stay at the Ritz Carlton at Marina Bay had a rough start. We checked in late last night at,the reception desk which was directly across the way from what could only be described as an extremely loud Las Vegas lounge act. It was so jarring and chaotic that we were afraid we had made the wrong choice of hotel.BUT Jonathan at reception could not have been nicer or more attentive. When we finally got up to our room we were immediately soothed by our surroundings. The room is beautiful, the bed and pillows were perfect. Breakfast today was magnificent...choices of foods from everywhere in the world beautifully presented with service to match.

Today, we dined at the Grand Ballroom for the “Breakfast is on us” Christmas gift donation event, and the service was exceptional. We were surprised at the level of attentiveness of the staff helping out for this event, and even the non-banquet staff were helping out, and always on their toes!   Shout out to technical staff, Zongren and Yingang, and all the others, whose job and expertise probably isn’t even in banquets. They provided such great service.

"A three hour taxi ride from Seletar Airport to Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Ian Y,"The Stanchart marathon on Saturday, 30 November 2019 caused road closures and taxi driver unfamiliar with route caused taxi to take three hours to reach Ritz-Carlton from Seletar Airport.  We were tired, anxious and angry. The U2 concert was at 8pm. We arrived at the hotel at 7.27pm, after having taken the taxi at about 4.37pm. The taxi fare was $92.  We checked in. We met Adam Teo, the Assistant Chief Concierge. Adam was calm and comforting. He did offer any excuses. He understood what we had gone through.  Adam had guided us to go into a car park that adjoined Ritz-Carlton's. But our taxi driver went into Pan-Pacific's car park.

Great start to our honeymoon,Compass788075,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia for the first two days of our honeymoon.  We stayed in a One bedroom Millenia Suite.    Our room was beautiful with sweeping views of Marina Bay.  The rooms was spacious, clean and elegantly decorated.  The decor and room is showing it’s age and could use a refresh.  Service was good.  We arranged a limo pickup and that went smoothly and they allowed us to skip the front desk line and check-in in our suite.  The club lounge is a must in my opinion. Tons of value here.  Delicious food and free flowing wine, champagne and cocktails.  Room service was also excellent. I highly recommend the Laksa.    The spa was good but not great.

We experienced amazing service with an upgrade, champagne and chocolates as we were both celebrating significant birthdays.  Really, they couldn't do enough for us.  There are newer/more modern 5* hotels in Singapore and we visited a few but the service didn't compare.  Our taxi driver told us that it was her favourite hotel as they treat everyone, no matter who, with such respect....and that's very telling.

Additionally, if you pay for the Club Lounge, you can utilize the free car service which will drop you at various places around the Bay.

The personable treatment I got during the week I stayed there, can easily cope with any 5-star + resort who would only look at a fraction of the scale that the Ritz-Carlton Millenia has to deal with. It’s not hard to see the handwriting of Peter Mainguy and his management team. Every staff member who I met, from the housekeeper to the front desk, to the security guy, had a smile on their face and wanted to please their guests.

"The Afternoon Tea, wow!!",Andy,"Didn’t stay here but booked the afternoon tea while on a weeks holiday to Singapore.  We had the drinks package, so 2.5 hours of free flow wine, champagne, beers and some the most incredible food we’ve had.  From lobster, crab claws, langoustine, mussels, to asian food, steak, chicken, salad, breads, cheese. To top it off, the service, as you’d expect, is flawless, friendly and efficient.

Best of all worlds,Gdax,"Stayed 5 days at Ritz.  Had a seamless, luxurious, quality experience.  Location:  Walking access to GBTB, Flyer, MBS, slightly longer walk to Chinatown, Bugis, Kampong Glam.  Close to Promenade MRT.  Rooms:  We had 29th floor corner room overlooking the bay.  Beautiful view to wake up and go to sleep each night.  Impeccable clean room, usually 2 services per day.  Comfortable bed, all the typical amenities of luxury hotel.  Food:  ordered room service one night which was fast and delicious.  Ate breakfast every morning at Colony.  Buffet had multiple stations with Dim Sum, Indian, local, etc.  Tried to vary each day and all was very tasty.  Did not have lunch or dinner buffet.

Rave Review Of The Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore,Ryann Stanger,"Let me start off by saying WOW. The whole experience at the Ritz Carlton Singapore was nothing short of amazing. My husband and I were celebrating our one year anniversary (and my 30th birthday) and we were treated like royalty!   There were a few people that made this experience so awesome that I’d like to mention. Lee Lee at the Colony restaurant made sure we tried EVERYTHING - she went above and beyond to make our experience so special. Our compliments go out to the incredible chefs (Nicolas, Daric, Yassin and JQ) that mastered every different type of cuisine that was served - Indian, Chinese, American, Japanese, I could go on...  Li Li and Eric (in housekeeping) decorated our room so beautifully and provided an incredible bottle of champagne. Adam at the concierge also sent…",5,November 2019,
Great views and exceptional service,Gary,"On our recent stay at the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore we enjoyed our two days there immensely.   We were fortunate to secure a club level suite which provided unobstructed views of the Marina Bay and pars of the city. Truly awesome views, especially at night ( looking at the Marina Bay Sands Resort and Casino is certainly a futuristic view)!  Aside from the view, the suite was wonderful.  The absolute best part of our stay was meeting the staff of the Club Lounge. Sheila (the Club Lounge level manager and Chuck Guzman the Assistant Club Lounge level manager both are above professional. Both my wife and I can say without any doubt that both Sheila and Chuck made our time at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia a joyous occasion.   The art tour of the hotels extensive art collection is not to…",5,November 2019,
Surprisingly excellent gym and buffet,Juan,"Spoiled for choice in Singapore, but this Ritz-Carlton tops most of the competition on two very important things for your business trip: a 24/7, state of the art gym (new equipment, smart lay out, TRX, etc.) and a breakfast and dinner buffet with a strong Asian flavor, not the usual bland world/international buffet. The service is also top notch and Mable distinguished herself at the reception desk and with her attentive follow ups.",5,November 2019,
2nd time in Singapore in two months,NYCKittyKat,"I’ve been to Singapore before, for business and stayed first at the M hotel (Jan. 2018_ and then the new Sofitel City Center (two months prior to this positing, Sept. 2018).  This time it was for a weekend trip for pleasure.  The hotel is your typical Ritz, grand lobby with beautiful flowers, etc. We had a room with a view of the bay on the 21st. Floor, the view was absolutely magnificent!    The rate per night was three times that of the Sofitel City Center, I would staying at the Ritz but if you are a little bit more budget conscious, I would recommend the Sofitel City Center.  To be honest, the rate is three times more at the Ritz and it’s an older hotel.  Apparently the Sofitel was just built not too long ago so the rooms are very new.  While the Ritz is located in a better…",4,November 2019,

Wonderful Stay,kelledstyle,"We stayed at the 5-star Ritz-Carlton Millenia set in Marina Bay with sweeping Singapore views. We had a warm welcome and the service was excellent. Our deluxe suite had a separate bedroom and living room, a luxurious marble bathroom, and a panoramic view of Marina Bay. Moreover, the spa is a must-try!

"Best Hotel, Views & Club Lounge in Singapore",Mel H,After not having stayed here for a few years it was like coming home. The welcome by all staff was so genuinely friendly and welcoming. The Marina Bay rooms are spacious and have incedible views by day and night. The Club Lounge is also great with i think up to five culinary presentations daily. If you are lucky (subject to availability) there is even a complimentary Club Limousine which will take youanywhere in the Marina Bay vicinity. HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE !!!,5,October 2019,
Wonderful Stay,SarahN,"Booked a 2D1N staycation. The room is huge with amazing view of the stadium and the Singapore flyer. Enjoyed soaking in the tub with a beautiful view in the morning. As it was a short stay we went for a swim in the evening which was great as the water in the pool was nice and warm and service at the pool (Indian guy in the evening and Lorenzo during the day) was excellent. We ordered food by the pool and it was delicious. The Spa ladies was very friendly and enthusiastic. Everyone was so friendly and kind. Special thanks to Sheila, Bulan, Jared and the lady who checked us in (I am sorry I couldn’t recall her name) short hair and wears glasses. They were always smiling and ready to offer assistance.  Thank you once again for such an amazing experience!   ",5,October 2019,
"Excellent location, dated but nice rooms, service not up to par",Dan P,Stayed at the Ritz in Singapore mid of October. We had booked via Amex FHR so when we arrived at the hotel at 1.30 pm we asked for a room upgrade (other hotels in the same category upgraded us before we had to ask). They bumped us from a Deluxe Marina room to a Premier Suite but they said the room wasn't ready and it might take 2h. After we were told we would get notified via email when the room is ready we left our luggage with the front desk and headed out for a bit. We came back after 3h and the room still wasn't ready yet (supposedly it was ready but had to be checked first). Around 5 pm we were finally able to go to our room. That is not acceptable for a hotel of this caliber considering we were eligible for early check-in (12pm) and showed up at 1.30 pm as we had…,4,October 2019,
Bitter & Sweet trip,Flowerchan,"Long story short, if you are a couch potato & loves to watch TV then I suggest you to stay away from this hotel.  If you can live without TV then I would recommend this hotel.    The receptions, concierge & employees are basically very friendly, nice and helpful.  The location is convenient. The view of Marina Bay Sand is absolutely gorgeous & a must see!!! (the selling point indeed)  Thanks to Evan, the Assistance Front Desk Manager & rest of his team, we were able to enjoyed trip.

Amazing hotel with amazing staff & management,DaveKarun,"Simply amazing. Room is spacious, eventhough the most standard room is already very spacious with good view. Location in Raffles and Suntec area is great for business trip. Staff and management are awesome and helpful. Had emergency matter last minute and the reservation team are willing to help and give refund. This is a true 5 star luxury hotel, they do things to help their guests and make their guests have better days. Unlike many other so-called wannabe luxury hotels like (looking at you Hilton, Mandarin Orchard, Sofitel) who cares more about money and room occupancy than helping their guests. Cannot recommend Ritz Carlton enough if you have some cash spare and you value luxury and true hospitality.",5,October 2019,
A calm and lovely hotel stay,Mango G,"Everything at this hotel is lovely. You find yourself saying ‘oh how lovely’ when you get a cold, menthol scented towel at the pool, or come back to your room to find a plate of beautiful macaroons.   The club level rooms are worth it - with great food and cold champagne waiting each time you arrive.   It was a pleasure to be looked after so well in the Club Lounge by Nivan, Jared, Millan and Ewan. Thank you. You made our trip more special. ",4,October 2019,
Fabulous Hotel,JimandJenFuller,"The Ritz Carlton Singapore is one of the world’s best hotels. The rooms are superb, the views of Marina Bay are to die for, and the people/service are more than A+. We stayed for a week (not our first stay) and were sad when it came time leave.  The concierge people are great: ask for the head concierge, Adam. He’s an absolute superstar and will help with all your needs. Jieping is very good, too, as are the others at that desk. Daisy in room service was so amazing. She even came to the front entrance (as did Jieping)to see us off when we departed. In the spa, Nita is great; the spa front desk person, Johnson, also was wonderful.

A View to Die For,Laurie B,"So...having stayed at several hotels in Singapore, I must say the service and amenities at all of the most famous can’t be beat. That includes the Ritz Carlton.  But what has made this visit a stand-out is the most incredible room overlooking every aspect of the bay and harbor. There is action every minute of the day and night...always something interesting to see ( even from the bathtub)  But the highlights are at night when Singapore puts on a very impressive light show in the bay surrounded by all the great hotels and the beautiful “ lit” flowers of the botanical gardens. It is simply beautiful and happens every night at eight and nine. Be sure to see it.  Better still, reserve a room on the bay side of the RC and watch from your very own bed with a glass of champagne ...…",5,October 2019,

Best Buffet for value (should have skipped breakfast),KimFrank,"Being in Singapore for only a short stay I was pleasantly impressed by the huge selection of international delights offered at the RitzCarton. The unscheduled visit to the hotel lead us to the buffet restaurant area at 12noon. A queue was forming by locals and international guests.   We joined in and managed to get a seat even though we didn’t have a booking. The staff was so friendly and attentive. Food very delightfully presented and tasted absolutely heavenly. All dishes regularily replenished, spotlessly clean.  Definitely will make this a ‘must visit’ on all of my trips to Singapore.",5,September 2019,

Great Place - Highly recommended,crew2008,"The room itself was nice and spacious but the furnishings were a little bit outdated.  The pool area was very neat with enough sunbeds and towels. The staff at the pool was very friendly.  An absolute must is the dinner buffet at Colony. This has been by far the best buffet we have ever been to……...! A huge variety of seafood and lobster as much you can eat, as well as plenty of Chinese, Indian, specialties.  Service is excellent. Very polite and professional. Asked for recommendations for restaurants and they are not only made our reservations but gave us directions.  Checking out was a little chaotic as there was a queue and someone was queuing behind another person which I thought that they were together but was surprised that they are not.  Would definitely stay here again.  ",4,September 2019,
Wonderful time and views,Gary B,"We cant speak highly enough about our four night stay at this hotel. We were given room 1920 and wow what a view of the bay, probably even better at night. The room was extremely spacious, with all mod cons and spotlessly clean. We paid extra for use of the club lounge and it was was worth every penny. The quality of food and drink and all times of the day was superb. We must give a speacial mention to Danny in the club lounge who was always very helpful with his local knowledge of attractions and places to go. But he was always ""lovely"" and had a great sense of humour. We had a fabulous stay and we rocmmend this hotel to everyone.",5,September 2019,

Amazing property and service!,Hirak K,"Stayed for 2 nights on a business trip. Was upgraded to a one bedroom suite with the Bay view. I was amazed the moment, I entered the room. Too large a sitting area and separately done up a study area and very big bedroom, toilet and walk in ward robe area. Each of these rooms can easily be the size of two rooms elsewhere. But the best part is the view. The entire room, study, bed room and toilet overlooks the Bay and Formula 1 stadium and part of the circuit. Could not attach the video here since we can only attach pics. Service is quite good. Very well groomed staff. Two things could have been better. 1. The lobby area is too busy and crowded.

We had breakfast in our room rate  which is quite extensive.  The hotel is very big, bit still have more private feeling, especially compared to Marina Bay Sands (which is Las Vegas type of no personal feelings hotel)  The king size bed and the bed sheets quality is fantastic :)  Concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable (sorry forgot her name)",5,August 2019,

Average,T.M,"The breakfast is Amazing, the choice is extensive and was a real highlight of our stay. The spa is very nice indeed and the bedrooms are spacious. Some area’s of the hotel are very nice however, there are also negatives and due to these I’m not sure we would revisit.  Although the attached bathroom is nice (although dated) the toilet cubicle is very small indeed, in fact, it is so small that I found it impractical as the door won’t open or close unless a person is standing and the facility is not being used.  There is no handheld shower attachment in the walk in shower cubicle (just an overhead shower head).  some areas of the hotel e.g. the lobby, the approach appear not to have changed from the 1970’s! due to the the initial impression of the hotel is disappointing.",3,August 2019,

The service was excellent, especially our room cleaner - Gerald, we were on the 7th floor. This is a luxury hotel with luxury prices, which is fine by me after all you get what you pay for, and believe you me you do get the five star service, nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are excellent and well stocked with soaps, shampoo etc. Some may find the room furnishings a little dated, i.e. a bit 1990ish, However I just love the fact that you get treated so well.

Rejuvenated again,JoeIIe,"Work stress was getting to me and since I only get one weekend off a month, I decided to treat myself at the Ritz-Carlton Spa. Why spend the money when I could get a massage for much less? asked the husband. To me, a trip here is not just about the massage. It's about the whole experience - the service, ambience, facilities, thoughtful amenities. When my therapist Fiona heard where I was aching, she suggested I switch to a customised massage which would give her more flexibility to treat my problem areas. Bless her, cos I left the place feeling much better. Would definitely try to book Fiona again.",5,July 2019,
Excellent Service,WRGII,Across-the-Board the service was excellent.    The property had a huge convention during my stay and this caused some issues with my room availability.

The junior-suite was spacious and comfortable.    I highly recommend.,5,July 2019,

The Hotel is located next to two shopping centers and in walking distance to the Singapore flyer, gardens by the bay and the Marina Bay Sands. The public areas of the hotels are clean, beautiful and full of art.   While the woman who escorted us from the car drop off to the front desk was very nice and helpful with first questions, the check in itself felt a bit rushed and not very welcoming.   The room itself was nice and spacious but the furnishings were a little bit outdated,  On the positive side there was a Nespresso coffee maker in the room, but unfortunately the tea was pretty poor quality. As I moved the wall mount of the TV to see better from the bed, i suddenly stood in a large…",3,September 2018,
a lovely stop over,plasticd,"Have stayed here a few times now. I love the rooms, and the staff do every bit extra., I went as they were getting ready for the National parade so things were a little more hectic. The breakfast also is extremely crowded so a lot more people that just the hotel I think.  But the quality of the rooms, the  genuine attention of the staff and the checkin check out process were impeccable. Congrats Ritz. Oh and we loved our massages. ( special shout out to Ritzia.. I think thats her name. Amazing massage)",5,August 2019,
Pricey but well worth it,paullim2016,"Close to the shopping malls and lots of restaurants, cafes, pubs. Short walk to the MRT. Walking distance to various attractions such as the Merlion, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Sands. Location wise it is very good.   Service is excellent. Very polite and professional. Asked for recommendations for restaurants and they are not only made our reservations but gave us directions.   Room is big and clean and has a great view of the river. Nice big bathtub which you can soak in and enjoy the view as well. Make sure you bring your bathsalt!  Bed is comfortable and quiet and I get good sleep.   Service in the restaurant is good but the food I had wasn’t up to expectation. Although my friend did enjoy her lunch.   Was a little disappointed when I asked for late check…",5,August 2019,
Still worth every penny,Seamunkee,Magnificent friendly service — second visit and the staff are still the same — great service nice food and overall good fun. Definitely worth a visit to one of their buffet’s - recommend the drink package and it becomes very good value.,5,June 2019,
Does not participate in Marriott Bonvoy Program :(,BeeLittle,"Beautiful hotel, large rooms, bathrooms are just awesome! Love it. Location just 5 minutes walking distance to Marina Sands Bay – cross the street and you are right on pedestrian bridge. That’s the place to stay while in Singapore.  Not this hotel does not participate in Marriott's Bonvoy Program therefore you will not recieve points nor the nights will not count towards you overall marriott stay :(",5,May 2019,

Exquisite Hotel,Charles B,I have visited this hotel at least 10 times or more and each time am so impressed by the staff as well as the hotel itself. I always stay on the Club Floor as the Club is one of the special features I enjoy the most. The rooms are very large and the view of Marina Bay including the Merloin  is spectacular. The food is excellent and I especially enjoy once during the visit the dinner buffet at Colony Restaurant. The pool is quite nice however it can get very busy especially with families in the afternoon. This was the only negative for me. Some of the children were playing wildly and were extremely noisy. Even though the parents did nothing to discourage this I feel the pool staff should intervene as this is the Ritz Carlton and not an amusement park.,5,July 2019,
Ritz Carlton Millenia - smply the best!,egdels,"This review is a bit delayed as we stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia from 4th to 7th April 2019.  One of these days I’ll get on top of the admin and submit a review promptly!  For my wife and me this was another trip from England to Singapore to visit our daughter and family. We were very much looking forward to seeing our three little grandaughters again. Whenever we visit Singapore, we always try to include a few days stay at the Ritz Carlton Club Level and each time one of our grandaughters joins us for a while. This time it was Alia’s turn.  After several stays there in recent years, we were very much looking forward to visiting once more. Yet again we were not disappointed and had a splendid stay.

Outstanding Service,momosid6,"My family and I traveled from Florida and Chicago to beautiful Singapore and stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Millenia. The location was perfect- scenic views of the bay and close proximity to shopping and major attractions.   We stayed on the Club Level where we had luxurious rooms and were served delicious gourmet dishes multiple times a day in the lounge. We were overwhelmed by the outstanding service we received on the Club Level from the housekeeping, chefs, lounge attendants, and the Club Manager, Sheila Marien Tan Benzon.   Sheila was phenomenal!  Just a few of the things she did for us included: organizing transportation, arranging VIP treatment at a restaurant in a different hotel, finding a heating pad for my mother, and presenting us with sweet treats and gifts at our…",5,August 2019,

Thank you all from David & India",5,August 2019,
Amazing Staff and Service,raj,"I had planned for a staycation to propose to my girlfriend (which happens to be on her birthday as well). I had approached a few hotels of which Ritz Carlton was the only one who had replied back with a brochure of the services they provide that may help me with my proposal plan.  It was the eagerness and the personalised touch of the staff that made me choose Ritz Carlton as the staycation cum proposal location. About one month prior to D-Day, I began liaising with the ERS team, who have been extremely extremely helpful and enthusiastic about the proposal plan (at times, I think they were more excited about it than me..haha). The team had provided suggestions and ideas that were overlooked by myself and went the extra mile to ensure that all angles were covered so that the…",5,August 2019,

"Impressive, elegant, amazing!",nabila,"Well, while on a business trip at KL, I decided to spend the weekend at Singapore and stayed one night at Ritz carlton.  It is well known and a famous chain world wide, and it is obvious to me why. If I start from the location and structure, it is exactly as it should be, and as expected by the guest. The lobby is well decorated. They have enough staff so that a guest never have to look for someone to ask something, no guest remain unattended! They speak multiple languages also, including clear and fluent English.  I had a merina view room. It literally took my breath away when i stepped in to be welcomed by the view!! The glass wall at 21/22 nd floor gave a spectacular view. The minibar was well equipped and nicely decorated. It had a bath and a shower.  The walk in closet…",4,June 2019,
"Service from the heart! Thank you, Yu Shan!",Liena J.,"I stayed with RC on the 14 July. My day started out bad with Mandarin Oriental screwing up my reservation and them giving me a lousy room. I demanded to cancel the booking and immediately called Ritz Carlton to check for room availability.   I was assisted by Yu Shan. And that was when the whole experience was flipped POSITIVELY! I am pretty sure I was angsty on the phone with all the nonsense that MO had put me through. Yu Shan never once lost interest in assisting me. She listened, & quickly gave me the information that I needed. She assisted me with the booking swiftly via the phone & highlighted to me that the hotel is running on high occupancy due to the NDP/fireworks showcase, but she will try her very best to get my room ready ASAP as she understood the frustration that I…",5,July 2019,

The Execuitive Lounge,Drkma-Q,"I stayed for 10 nights with my family. Since I am a platinum member with Bon Voy, I had excess to the Executive Lounge. Chuckie the assistant manager of the execuitive lounge always treat us above and beyond.   Overall the hotel location is great and the staff are very professional and friendly. The hotel is very clean and the cleaning staff always clean your room and surprise you of their cleanliness.    Definitely I would highly recommend Singapore Ritz again and again.  ",5,August 2019,
Excellent Hotel and World Class Service,Hekkerz N,There really isn't anything bad to say especially if you have a room with a view of the Marina. The service that this hotel provides is nothing like I have ever experienced and the best part of it is that it's 100% GENUINE and not manufactured service.  Would definitely stay here again,5,July 2019,
Excellent Location,AztecLife,"Stayed for 4 nights on our way to Borneo.  We were unsure whether to pay this much for a hotel but were so glad we did.  The hotel was fantastic and the location was perfect and meant we walked virtually everywhere (MBS, Gardens by the Bay, China Town, Clarke Quay, Merlion). Had a taxi to the zoo and also hired scooters from City Scoot for 2 hours one morning which were great fun.  A lovely pool for cooling off during the afternoon if the sun gets too much and sun beds were always available.    Staff were helpful and always on hand if you needed anything and the breakfast was fantastic with soooo much choice (only place I have visited where you can get an ice cream cone at breakfast!)

The staff at the lobby were very helpful . The rooms had an amazing view of the marina bay which made my stay memorable for a short period of time . However the rooms need to be renovated a little  as the corners had scratches and dents . Overall great location and great hotel,4,July 2019,
Singing the praises of the Ritz Carlton Singapore,moe7272," My stay at the Ritz Carlton Singapore was not at all what I expected. En route to the hotel we learned that the British soccer team was staying there and I was instantly filled with dread. I was sure we’d get lost in the sauce—but I am happy to say that I was wrong.  Upon check in, I mentioned my elite status but was reminded that they do not (and never did) participate in Marriott Bonvoy program, I was disappointed that what I read was in fact true.   When checking in, I casually shared that we were in Singapore for three fun filled days to kickoff my husbands birthday celebration and a milestone wedding anniversary before heading to Phuket and much to my surprise, those facts were not lost on Riri Yufriane, the hotel manager. She was amazing! First, understanding that we were…",5,July 2019,
Review on ballroom banquet staff,Bella,"Attended a wedding dinner at the hotel's ballroom with great service from all servers from cocktail hour till the end of the late night. Particularly exceptional was Mdm Peck San for our table. She was very cheerful and thoughtful to details with our table throughout the night. Even with the many different requests for drinks etc,  she never faltered and still managed to handle everything with a genuine attitude with smiles. It was a pleasure to meet Mdm Peck San that night!",5,July 2019,

One of the best hotels I’ve been to,Ian S,"Luxury in every way. That’s how I would describe our entire stay. All of the hotel staff are very polite and nice. They would really ensure to make your stay comfortable. The room is really big and spacious. Very kid friendly too! They even provide kids welcome kit (coloring book, crayons, baby soaps and slippers). Kid plates and spoons are provided too on breakfast buffet. The breakfast has a wide range of choices and is really good.   One minor thing though, is I think they are not accepting AMEX card.  I would have to say Ritz Carlton Millenia SG have change the way I want my hotel experience to be. Amazing stay!   ",5,July 2019,
Still Great!,Ed Rosenstein,"Glad to have changed our hotel in Singapore for the return leg from Bali.   We last stayed here in 2014 and can say that the hotel keeps on improving. Colony, the pool gym and spa are all great additions. Rooms are starting to age gracefully and could do with a facelift.   For me this hotel is streets ahead from the other hotels around Marina Bay.   We chose club lounge access as Bonvoy elite status doesn’t get you into club level at any Ritz and it’s so worth it. No comparison to any other Marriott brands (including the JW nearby).   ",5,July 2019,
Poor front desk staff,mia f,"Having stayed and worked for other ritz-Carlton   and Marriott establishments,the quality of service in front desk of Singapore has disappointed me. The level of service that I encountered has not reached my expectation of the “Ritz-Carlton level”in any of the ritz Carlton properties that I’ve stayed.   We arrived the hotel on 11th for 3 nights. Upon arrival, the bell boys have done a great job in welcoming us with charming smiles and good services, they’ve gotten our names and informed in their speaker while directing us to the front desk. However, the front desk seemed not to know we are here for c/I and had to ask for all those questions and our names again.

One of the better 5 stars in Singapore,aileroll,Growing up in Singapore I’ve always wondered how the skyline of Raffles Place looked from those octagon windows. I was fortunate to experience that on my recent trip to Singapore. Singapore’s skyline has expanded since and the view from the rooms are drop dead gorgeous.   Fit and finish is often lacking in 5 star properties in Singapore. This property doesn’t disappoint with its high quality furnishing that is modern enough for me and sufficiently restrain for my parents.   The location is decent. Along the quieter part of the bay and within close distance of the shopping districts and business districts.   Rarely stays are perfect. Ritz Carlton Singapore’s staff have a sharp eye in correcting errors they spot and initiating service recovery.  Housekeeping is faultless too and…,5,June 2019,
Excellent stay at The Ritz Carlton,Chirag Zaveri,"I stayed there for 5 days & must say that overall experience while staying at The Ritz Carlton has been very satisfying. First of all, the hotel is placed at a prime location & the ""Singapore Flyer"" is at a walk-able distance from the hotel. The staff has been very polite & courteous throughout.  There were couple of areas where I still feel I would have enjoyed my stay thoroughly. First one to mention is about the channels available in your room TV. There were very limited number of them made available. Given the fact that I was staying at a time when Cricket world cup was going on, I would have loved if they allowed the broadcast of matches on TV in room.",4,June 2019,
Wonderful Stay,ahindle2010,"My husband and I stayed here for 12 nights. We stayed in a Marina Bay view room with executive lounge access. Nothing was too much trouble, even before we arrived at the hotel we were contacted and asked if we had any special requests. We celebrated our 31st Wedding Anniversary and received a cake and bottle of champagne during our stay. The Executive lounge well worth it, excellent service, food and champagne throughout the day. At present we live in Melbourne and have never received such excellent service or food. We would most certainly stay here again on our way back to Europe.",5,July 2019,
Great place great food great service,Eve Ho E,"Went for their buffet. The whole dining experience was one of the best I ever had. Enjoyed the oysters ( unfortunately only from one country), the seafood and the service. Special thanks to Ben and Connie ( supervisor) who helped my tipsy friend to the car.  Truly a restaurant where the staff goes the extra mile.  The slice of bday cake was really delicious!! ",5,July 2019,
Unworthy for the price. Service is not that of a luxury hotel.,Sansanee W,"The worst experience!! Suddenly there was a water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom at 10pm!!   It was unpleasant already to have to move to a new room at night but what is worse is that our room was downgraded.  The manager on duty did not even come to meet us if we did not ask her to check out our damaged room. When she came, I cannot feel any sympathy or apology, from her at all. She didn’t say sorry to us, she just said “I cannot do anything because blah blah blah....”  Like packing and moving to a new room late at night was not frustrated enough already, the staff sent to help with our stuffs did not even bring a cart!! We then have to carry our own luggages and many small stuffs by ourselves down to the new room!!   The hotel has to understand that clients who…",1,July 2019,
Wonderful Stay,Gemma,"My mum and I spent two nights at the Ritz Carlton and the service was outstanding. Every staff member was friendly and went out of their way to help, especially Nidhi at Customer Relations who took a good 10-15 minutes annotating a map of Singapore with all the things to know (I think we made it through almost everything too!).   The drinks at the bar downstairs were wonderful and the rooms were flawless. The view was spectacular, the bedding so comfortable, bath luxurious and everything was super clean.   Thank you so much to everyone we encountered during our stay you made it very memorable.",5,June 2019,
Started off bad but ended on a high note,Alkhabbaz,"Initially had a very bad first day which included transportation and check in at the hotel. But the management really made up for it once they found out what a bad first day experience I had at the hotel.

Thanks again.",5,July 2019,
Always Great,Premium Flyer - Travel Different®,"Another great stay at Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore.  Fantastic view over Marina Bay from the rooms and the view from the club lounge (which is worth paying more to include) was breathtaking at night.  It's a great option for those who want a view of Marina Bay Sands but like me wouldn't stay there.  Great service, great massage at the spa, can't wait for next time!",5,May 2019,
The most amazing breakfast buffet and service in Singapore,keo s,"This buffet was amazing and had so many options and choices of food to eat. Definitely plan on at least an hour as you'll want to eat slowly and eat a lot. Everything we had was delicious - from the eggs benedict to the fresh honey and fresh squeezed juices to the dim sum and decadent desserts.   If I could give an extra star (6 star) - it would be due to Lee Lee's excellent service. She was so helpful, catered to everything we could even want, and just was over the top nice. We loved talking to her and she is an amazing server. Next time I come back, I'm definitely bringing my mom and we will definitely see Lee Lee again. The Ritz is lucky to have such a great talent and team member on staff.",5,June 2019,

Kudos and thank you to the team at Colony !  Mahesh, guest relations supervisor, deserves a mention as he immediately prepared a beautiful bouquet of flowers after knowing that it's my mother's birthday! She was filled with joy when she saw the flowers.  The attention to details and warm hospitality has been the signature of the ladies and gentlemen at The Ritz Carlton, Singapore. They truly are the reason why we would come back again ! ",5,July 2019,
Quiet elegance,Joe,"The Marina Bay location is special and the rooms, lobbies and public spaces have great architecture and art.

Great birthday surprise for kids. Although there are some serious issues about hotel services.,Unalome W.,"We booked this hotel for our twins 8th BD party. The hotel prepared the best BD surprise ever. Thanks to the person who managed this for us. Apart from that, everything else is something I don’t want to remember.  Here are some minor/major difficulties;  1. For every issue you report/request to the front desk, they will keep on transferring you to the responsible ‘division’. While transferring, you will wait for about 5 minutes averagely before another person pick up the phone, he or she will get you to explain the issue again. Then that person will make you again hold the line while transferring you to a responsible ‘person’ in that division. Overall, before each issue is solved, you will have to speak about your problem for 5 times (hypnotizingly) and wait around 15 minutes.…",3,June 2019,

Upon arriving at the hotel, I was escorted to the club lounge and relaxed with sparkling water and champagne while waiting to check in and for a brief while while my room was made available.

It was clean, luxurious and the staff was so lovely, in particular Bulan who made sure everything was perfect. The location is perfect as it is right on the marina. The food was yummy and served so beautifully. My only complaint (and it’s not a complaint, but rather a suggestion) is for the hotel to take into consideration there may be 2 in a room so more storage space would be welcome.

The Ladies & Gentlemen there go above and beyond to ensure that your stay is everything it ought to be and more. From the moment that we were collected at the airport until the moment we departed we received a level of attention and service from members of staff that has left us with many happy memories.

Spectacular,ConnaSir,"Expectations for family travelers to Singapore should be modulated because it’s a business-first city. Most luxury properties (the Mandarin, Fullerton, Peninsula, etc.) feel corporate and tend to be located in areas proximate to work. Others, like the atrocious Marina Bay Sands, are casinos dressed up as hotels and are indistinguishable from anything you might find in Vegas.  The Ritz Carlton is in its own class. While situated in the Marina Bay area, a short walk from the downtown core, it’s removed from the throngs of tourists encircling the Fullerton and Peninsula and is a beautiful, quiet oasis unto itself. The views are spectacular; the hotel’s design are art work are gorgeous; the pool is long and beautiful; the spa and gym are extraordinary; and the service — can I tell…",5,June 2019,
Wasn’t the service I was expecting,Phyrian,"My partner and I had book a room at the Ritz Carlton, Singapore for a night and had requested for an early check in. We know that it is upon availability this before we headed to the hotel, we had use the chat system in the Marriott Bonvoy app to check for the status. But the response she received from the customer service was appalling as they just informed us to head to the front desk to check ourselves. So what was the purpose of having the chat in the first place. I had to specifically inform my partner to push them to assist before they told us that they will update us if our room was available. As a hotel of this caliber, I don’t think that this was the proper service that should be given to all guest. While walking into the property, i was expecting some smiles at the…",2,June 2019,
Don’t even think about staying somewhere else.,MissKatharine,"I have stayed here twice in the last month, once with my family and once on my own.

Both times we have had the club facility on the 32 nd floor. Danny, Chuck, Bing, Michelle and all the team could not have done more to make our stay super comfortable. Our daughter with Coeliac was looked after beautifully and generally the food is absolutely incredible.

I loved bringing my family here.  As a result of my once a month stay, every one in the hotel called out my name and welcomed me back whenever I entered the lobby.   The luxurious room with their high RC bed was something I always looked forward to. And those fluffy white slippers were so inviting. A card by the GM slipped under the free bottles of water was a nice touch. Not to mention the bath tub that came with great sea view while the Merlion stood in the distance.

I believe they have the largest standard rooms of any 5 star hotel in Singapore and they really are large.

Sheila, the Club Manager, is the best helped admirably by Danny and all the other staff.",5,June 2019,
Extraordinary service!,JohnAgger,"The service I consistently get at this hotel if nothing but outstanding. Auntie Lee Lee in the Colony Surf restaurant is so kind and attentive, and have served me dishes not even on the menu. Mr. Vadivelu in Guest Services has also gone above and beyond to assist. I highly recommend RC Singapore as a place to stay if you find yourself in the beautiful city and country of Singapore",5,April 2019,
Nice experience!,Kelly29,Staying at the hotel was a really nice experience! The staff were all very smiley and ready to help you in every way! The food wuality at breakfast and restaurants very good! The only thing that missed was the humidity inside the rooms and the luck of music channels..But we really enjoyed our stay and would come back! Thank you Ritz Carlton!,4,June 2019,
"Incredible, luxurious stay.",cosmicgirl1978,"From the moment we checked in (in the comfort of the club lounge - no standing around at the reception desk) we knew we were in for a special stay. Service here was exemplary and many staff would pre-empt any needs we had. We had a city view room on the club lounge floor, so could access breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, cocktails etc. There were stunning views of the bay from here. The room itself was a very good size and decorated in a classic style, but great quality design and fixtures and fittings. The bathroom too was a good size, and great to have a bath with a view!  The food and drink were of excellent quality, including the fantastic dinner buffet in the main hotel restaurant. The pool area was fantastically relaxing and beautifully designed. It had a huge pool and…",5,April 2019,
6 Star Service!!,Alhejazian,"As ever, the Ritz-Carlton brand keeps on delivering super-high end luxury hotels and resorts. Beautiful design, spacious rooms and comfortable areas. The staffs are well trained and extremely polite and helpful.  The highlight for me was the level of presentation, personalise service and food in the club lounge - your chefs are outstanding.  A particular mention goes to Firdaus and all his team in club who looked after us so well in the lounge - for such a busy hotel, Firdaus treated us with so much care and attention and were extremely friendly and cheerful. All in all we had a superb stay and hope to return when we are back in Singapore!",5,April 2019,
It's a wow place,Ahmed_Sohaib,This offer was really magnificent everything is excellent including the food lottery understand the location whether you're coming in a business trip or in a vacation will enjoy it. Room cleanliness is magnificent and the staff are really helpful,5,October 2018,

A night out with my friends.,isaac,Had a great night out with my group of frens (5pax) at Chihuly lounge.   Great friendly service by the team. I like to thank Regina and Sharon for the warm welcome and service for the evening.   Also thank you to Sandrine for reservation of a nice sofa.   Great songs by singer john allard too.   Cant wait for my next visit.,5,May 2019,
Still the one ...,Andrew F,"I first stayed in this hotel 20 years ago, when it was cutting edge. Of course a lot has evolved since then, and I was a little apprehensive as to how the rooms would fare against modern standards. No need to worry about service - this remains top class. The good news is the RC has evolved with the times, and it is a great experience in room as well as in the catered areas of the hotel. I was attending a conference at the Mandarin, which is easily walked to from the RC, and the RC lacked nothing in ambience. Singapore has so many great hotels, and maybe my history here makes me biased, but in my opinion, the RC is still the one when it comes to top class hotels in SG.",5,November 2018,
Amazing food!,534cherylM,"Have been to many high end hotels and this one was amazing. Every single staff went out of their way to say hi and help in anyway they could. Too many places now where people pass the buck, have the attitude it isn't their job. No staff at this hotel in any area looked the other way. They were there to assist at every circumstance. Shows the have a great manager. Hotel room was gorgeous with huge floor to ceiling windows. The shower pressure was great. Didn't want to leave our room!  Central to everything. Pool area and spa were also fantastic. The buffet breakfast had so much variety. Best buffet we have ever had. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,May 2019,
5 star hotel with 7 star service!,ccarson0205,"My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon and it was an amazing experience. Firstly, the staff are fantastic. They really make the hotel. We were given a complimentary room upgrade as well as bubbly and chocolates. The room was luxurious with the most amazing views over the Marina Bay and the bathroom...words cannot describe, absolute luxury. Would highly recommend and will defiantly be back.",5,May 2019,
One of the best hotels in SG,Alvin_Liu,I stay here regularly when I visit SG and the service has always been exceptional. The rooms facing the Marina Bay are just phenomenal but those facing Kallang is not too bad as well. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The bathtub by the windows are the best! Breakfast is also amazing!,5,April 2019,
"The Ritz Carlton... The most courteous, welcoming staff you will ever encounter!",Lois bown,"The staff here couldn't do enough! They are so kind and always asking if there is anything else they could do to help... We have never been served so ridiculously well before. Extremely helpful with tips about what to do around the local area, what the best foods are, where the best hideouts are, and after you come back from a long day out they're always there to greet you at the door, holding the doors open for you and welcoming you back! Served so much of the local food today at breakfast by Lee Lee, Chef Shu Cheeh, Chef Anthony, Samantha, Chef Xavier, Chef Kelly and Chef Benton. Tried foods I've never experienced before including golden mushrooms, Singapore toast, Kue lapis,and odho odho!!!

Luxurious Hotel and Amazing Service!,Cindy Marie Azur,"Excellent place, view and service! Definitely a 6-star hotel experience. It was my surprised bday present 🎁 to my fiancé and we’re both very happy that first we had a very smooth check-in. Second, we got the best view and/or room location facing the Marina Bay Sands . Third, they delivered us cake for my fiancé for his bday. Buffet breakfast winner! Variety of dishes to choose from appetisers, local dishes, salad, desserts and so on. Overall, very happy and satisfied guests. Will definitely recommend for those who don’t mind to spend a bit pricey hotel but great service at the same time. Excellent! ",5,September 2018,
Luxury Beyond Word,Joyshree S,"The Ritz Carlton, Millenia is a beautiful property. The rooms are spacious, both the types of rooms (city view & Marina bay view) are serene. The staff is extremely polite and hospitable. They do beyond expectation to make you comfortable.The in-room dining service is so classy. The room decor is sophisticated and modern. The breakfast spread has continental, Japanese, Indian, salads etc. The gym has some of the best equipments I have ever seen in any hotel. The in-room dining menu is limited and the food is a bit on the expensive side. The house keeping team keeps a bookmark which has the best art collections printed which you can see on the property when they come for turn-down service.",5,May 2019,
View May be Great; But WiFi & TV Not So Much,CM65,"We are frequent RC guests in Singapore & around the world. We have noticed a significant decline in the WiFi & Television capabilities in this property. Around 8pm -11pm, the TV produces unrecognizable sound and picture on multiple channels (see attached photos and note channel title in each). This sucks if you have small children that you’ve put to bed or enjoy TV/a movie at the end of a long work day. It is recognizably worse when there is an event that books out the lower floors of the hotel. We wish it were better, especially since the hotel “upgraded” from Samsung to LG televisions.",2,May 2019,
About Chihuly Lounge,Des Mer,"A really wonderful place to relax and chill and just enjoy the atmosphere either by yourself or with others. I came to Chihuly recently as a couple and we had an amazing time with love songs played live with some that we requested, wonderful drinks and food, and gracefully attended by the lovely manager Sandrine. Very sophisticated atmosphere for a good price. Will definitely come back.",5,May 2019,
Best service ever,Agata,I had the pleasure to spend very nice evening at Chihuly Lounge with accompaniment of live music and delicious snacks . Thanks to Sandrine and Dunsten I will have unforgetable memories from this tasty and elegant place . I recommend Chihuly Lounge to every single couple or anyone who appreciate a good atmosphere built by professionals .,5,May 2019,
Great service at Chihuly Lounge,sjwq913,"I visited RC with my friend for an afternoon tea on 17 May. The ambience was good with melodious piano accompaniment.   I was pleasantly surprised by the service provided by the friendly staff at Chihuly Lounge. The team, led by Mr Rudi, enhanced my first experience at RC. They were Natalie, Dunstan, Sharon and Benjamin and Chef Sundar.  Natalie was especially thoughtful. She added a side table for our spread and carefully moved it to the other side when she noticed water dripping from the air conditioner. I enjoyed Sharon's introduction of the food. Dunstan also checked in regularly.   The choice of food was wonderful. The menu has got it all, from savoury to sweets. We ordered a set of afternoon tea, ala carte calamari, salted egg yolk chicken cubes and fish skin and avocoda…",5,May 2019,
Iconic Hotel,prateek s,The people are fantastic...room size is huge..well maintained room..club lounge is worth the extra cost..do try their patisserie it is very good..it is in close proximity to MRT otherwise taxis are available all the time..will definitely stay here whenever I am in Singapore...,5,May 2019,
Chihuly Lounge Fantastic,The World Hotel Traveller,"I had a date night with my girlfriend one evening and decided to have Chihuly lounge as one of our episodes for the night. We had such a sweet time in a very cozy yet sophisticated and elegant environment. We were catered to by Sandrine the really wonderful manager, who was all around sweet and had great conversations with my girlfriend and I, and also provided wonderful recommendations about the lounge and its menu, among other interesting conversational episodes, alongside her impeccable service. Beside Sandrine was also a young friendly lad who catered to our table called Dunsten who was very accommodating and took very good care of us. Definitely recommend Chihuly Lounge, and the interior decoration is wonderful, plus some times you’d have the chance to hear some live music.",5,May 2019,
Couldn’t be happier with Ritz-Carlton SG!,vickylovesparis,"I’ve stayed at this property for 3 days. It was one of the best customer service experiences I’ve ever had. They are so efficient and professional, they are into details. They went above and beyond to enhance my stay from the beginning, in particular SITI. Facilities are stunning, my fav was the bathtub with gorgeous views, spacious rooms, good restaurants and nice fitness center. Location is great too. For me this hotel was a five out of 5. I def recommend it and if I come to SG again I’ll stay there!!",5,May 2019,
Business and leisure,memonzella,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel.  The room was in disrepair - hinges of cabinet doors were broken and electric sockets didn’t work.  But the worst was the sewage smell coming from the toilet.   The management seemed eager to move our room, but we had already unpacked and my husband didn’t want to move.  When we complained the manager seemed outwardly concerned but was a bit snide.   The design of the hotel was lovely and most of the staff seemed well trained in their job but some were uninterested in the good customer service I hope to see in a 5 star hotel.    Overall I thought this hotel relied too much on its brand name and not enough on maintaining high quality. ",3,May 2019,
Best staff and chefs in Singapore,Caroline W,"My husband and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for his 50th Birthday for 6 days and it was truly the best holiday we have ever had.

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel so welcome and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. The food and drink offering was fantastic and we especially enjoyed the champagne and espresso martinis. A special thank you to Tina who provided us with recommendations and treated us to a local dessert.  As we were celebrating our anniversary, we were kindly upgraded to a marina view room. The view was spectacular and I enjoyed the view from the bath each evening. The bed was comfortable and we slept so well. Already planning our return and we’ve not yet left Changi airport!",5,May 2019,
Best housekeeping experience ever!,dominik78,"There is not much to add about the hotel itself that has not been written before: excellent breakfast buffet, beautiful rooms with large windows, the „sexiest“ bathrooms in Singapore and a nice outside pool. Location in walking distance to the Helix Bridge is great and perfect for an early morning run around the Marina Bay.  The only criticism that we would have - other than that the hotel for all its beauty inside is probably amongst the ugliest buildings in Singapore from the outside - is that the safe deposit box in most of the guest rooms were not operational during our stay due to „scheduled upgrading“ work. We hope that this has been completed as in particular in a five star property where guests a safe deposit box in the room is an important feature.  I‘m still giving…",5,March 2019,
An oasis in the midst of scenic and vibrant Marina Bay Singapore,Becks,"From the moment we arrive up to the lush doors of the Ritz Millenia, concierge were on hand to help my friend and I, Kalai was especially nice to us.  Alex at the front desk took us immediately up to the room (2926) and explained how this was the room that the architect who built The Marina Bay Sands hotel usually stays in as it has the best view of the hotel and the bay, and I must admit I've never seen a view so nice, we were both completely memorized and in awe.   Alex who was completely professional and very knowledgeable introduced us to the Club supervisor Tina who proceeded to do an in-room check-in and show us the facilities.  Once we had rested and visited the pool, we went for a nice chilled evening in the club lounge for a bite to eat and some lovely Rothchilds…",5,May 2019,

beautiful,Stormie,"This is a really beautiful hotel. Our room with the view was stunning. Service was very friendly and welcoming. My only complaint is that the hotel did not tell us that there was a event at the hotel the evening we were there so we could not use the pool area, they would drive us to the Conrad hotel if we wanted to do that. We were only in Singapore one night and we couldn't use the facilities. The hotel was really busy with people coming and going for whatever corporate event they were having. It really bothers me when hotels do this. When I booked the hotel 2 months ago they had to have known this event was already scheduled. WHY DO HOTELS NOT TELL THEIR GUESTS WHEN THEY HAVE EVENTS??? I find this very rude. I think other than this it would have been an excellent stay but this…",4,May 2019,
Restaurant / buffet is gorgeous,Groovemasterjay,"I didn't enjoy any housing in this hotel but I did enjoy their restaurant / buffet and it was an absolut treat.

"The best service I have ever experienced, and I have travelled the world",Samantha J,"When I was researching where to stay, I was tossing between the Ritz Carlton and the Fullerton.  We opted to stay at the Ritz and I'm so glad we did. The location is excellent - we have the most magnificent view of Marina Bay Sands, and we are within walking distance of many malls and good restaurants. The food is impeccable - we dined in the restaurants and in the room on multiple occasions. The spa is so luxurious and well thought out. The gym amenity is fantastic. What has stood out the most is about this hotel is the service.  I have been to some of the best hotels around the world, but the service at this particular Ritz stands out.

It was elegant & beautifully designed and felt very welcoming from the moment we walked in the doors. The service from all of the staff was also excellent. Faultless.   We had connecting rooms (one for our 2 kids), Club level overlooking the Marina. The rooms were so spacious and well appointed. The bath directly overlooked Marina Bay Sands which is a view I still reflect back on. It was lovely. The Club was great too. We were always made to feel so welcome. It was quiet which we enjoyed and the food was plentiful. The Colony buffet was amazing. So many stations of food. Well worth experiencing.

Spacious bathroom. Beautiful view (even the room facing Kallang District view is still spectacular in my opinion). Built-in universal adapter and USB port. - Cons: Only one basin in the bathroom. Powder room (toilet room) is small.  Overall: I have to say that what makes this hotel stands out is its world class service.

Awesome experience as newlyweds!,QuekZT,"My husband and I held our solemnisation at the Summer Pavilion Garden Suite and our wedding lunch at the Colony restaurant on 1st May 2019. This location was the number 1 choice in our list and it was the right decision.   Service: Our wedding planning and the coordination was professionally done by the Ritz team. Well organised and the attention given to the guest are being implemented throughout the event. The hotel's policy of no signage ensure that all ground staffs are well informed of any events happening and to make sure every individual who walk in to the hotel are being guided to wherever they are heading to.

"Great location, busy hotel, nice rooms",Russell N,"I stayed here on a business trip for 3 days.  The hotel is conveniently located near business district so was only a short commute to where we wanted to go.  The rooms are really nice and modern, the open window concept whilst you are showering is unique.  Only only gripe on the room was the safe wasn’t working so I just kept my valuables with me.  The hotel was very busy at this time so sometimes it was quite a wait for the lifts and the queue for meals in the buffet section can get quite long, they don’t seem to have enough people taking people to their seats, there are seats available just a long wait to get someone to take you there.  I’d recommend this hotel just for its location and rooms though, that’s the main reason I was looking for a hotel.",5,April 2019,
"Staff top, room condition flop",Villiger,"We were looking very much forward to our stay in the Ritz. It was very kind that we could have an early check-in. We also got a slightly bigger corner room and the view was absolutely stunning. The room interior is actually very tasteful and the room quite large. Unfortunately the condition of the room is totally unacceptable for this class of hotel and price. One of the wall pannels was pushed in, so that there was quite a large gap in the wall. The carpets got really bad stains, some mirrors got large blind spots below the bath tub, the bath tub itself is rough and not shiny anymore and the mattress is more like hammock because it's to old.  Having said that, we were overvelmed by the kindness of the staff and the absolutely amazing service they provide! A big bravo and thank…",3,April 2019,
"Super staff,shame about room standard..",Neetu V,"This was our first visit here,and we were so looking forward to this stay,so here are the pros and cons of the hotel. Pros: -Lovely welcome and swift check in -Wonderful pool and pool area - We also dined at the Colony twice and the staff there are absolutely excellent.  Cons: -For us,something totally unacceptable,was the mattress.It sank completely down the middle after 3-4 hours,and none of us could sleep well because of it. -Stains on the carpet and also,general standard of the room is not acceptable for a hotel of this standard.For prices of USD 400 and above per room,gradual room renovations must be done.

Return visit,Nick G,"Second time to the Ritz Carlton in Singapore and had high expectations based on our last excellent experience there.  This time around were in Club Suite, so a smaller offering, but perfectly okay for us. The room itself was modern and well laid out with excellent connectivity for those carry a lot of media and devices. Only issue was the shower which was luke warm despite the other taps running hot. Not a show stopper and we did not bother reporting it.  The lounge this time was back to the 32nd floor and I felt it had lost its spark. Previously, the lounge was undergoing refurbishment and had been moved to the pool level. I really loved the attentive service and effort the staff made during that period. This time however, the service was only average, no real effort, food…",3,April 2019,
Amazing experience in Singapore,alexli,"My wife and myself stayed at the hotel for our anniversary, it was definitely one of the best experience we have ever had. The Japanese speaking gentlemen assisted us at check in was very professional and escorted us to our room. The view was awesome facing to the marina bay sands, it took us more than one hour just to take photos. We had dinner in the club lounge and Sheila provided first class service there, making us feel so comfortable. Food were delicious too!  It was unfortunate that we got sick on the second day, special thanks to Lance from the hotel who really took care of us and made us feel like home. There are many others who provided execellent service but I couldn't remember the names. Recommending to all who goes to Singapore, must stay at The Ritz-Carlton.",5,April 2019,
Fantastic return stay!!,"The Ellisons, Melbourne","Had a fabulous stay at the Ritz Carlton - we checked in early and the staff were friendly, accommodating and after realising we had stayed before they upgraded us to a high floor with stunning views which was much appreciated and a lovely touch of recognition as a previous guest. As ever attention to detail was faultless with friendly, professional staff who acknowledge and greet you at all points of contact.  Their breakfast is the best in the world and I defy anyone to not be amazed by the quality, range on offer, freshness or service levels.  The rooms at the Ritz are bigger than average and super comfortable.

Ritz Carlton stay for a few nights,Natalie P,"This hotel has the highest standards and was an absolute pleasure to stay here with my family. From the man that opened the taxi door and knew my daughters name, to the amazing food and beverages.

One night staycation,Annie Q,"My husband booked this one night staycation as a belated birthday present for our girl.  One down point was that we requested early check-in (was asked to confirm by the hotel for this request which is at 10am, one day before the check-in date) but when we reached the hotel yesterday morning (20/04/19) around 9plus, we waited till nearly 1pm before we got our room. Thank goodness the room provided us a very good view and spacious. The amenities and facilities are okay on average but think the hotel will get better rating if undergo some upgrading renovations.

It was my friend’s birthday and he arranged a room with the most fantastic view and brought a cake and bottle of wine to celebrate her birthday. What an absolute gem this man is and I cannot thank him enough for making our stay so special. Definitely recommend this hotel if you want to stay somewhere where they treat you like royalty.,5,April 2019,
The Number One Luxury Hotel In Singapore!,Dr. James O. Davis,"I consider the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore to be one of the finest hotels in Asia today. I have stayed here on several occasions and have also hosted international leaders here.   I encourage you to secure a suite with a view of the city. It has a gorgeous view!  While I was there the last time, I order room service, while taking in the view of the city from my room.   When I arrived at the Singapore International Airport, I had arranged a hotel driver to pick me up. He was there on time and made my exit from the airport fast.",5,September 2018,
Excellent stay for family of four,L C,"This is one of the best hotel experiences we’ve ever had, travelling with kids. From the moment we enquired about a room via email to the day we left, we were blown away by the level of personal service. Most hotels in Singapore do not allow a family of four in one room (expecting us to book two rooms) and so we were very relieved to find out that the Ritz Carlton could fit us all in one room. Reservations staff, Charis and Melody, were great at responding to our questions and accommodating our requests to make the room child-friendly, e.g. by providing plastic cups and a step stool and removing all the items from the bar fridge. They even came to greet us when we arrived to check in at the hotel and walked with us to Marina Square to show us where we could find various food…",5,March 2019,
"Great hotel, a few little technical issues",tony w,"It's a huge hotel but still you get a lot of excellent personal service, including the classic 5 star 'holding the door open' on arrival/exit and greetings from all the staff you pass.  It's not the finest architecture from the outside, but it's very plush inside with lots of marble and mirrors, and a fine garden/pool area.  The room was enormous (unfortunately you have to pay more for a Bay view so my view was of an overpass and lots of dull buildings), as were many of the features eg the bed, shower, window, blinds, wardrobe (walk-in), TV etc. I loved the 'all lights off' function by the bed, but it's annoying when some low-level lights stay on as I really like total darkness.  Again the furnishings in the room were very good quality including a good sturdy desk, excellent…",4,April 2019,
A great stay in amazing Singapur,AlexVera,"A very good option to stay in this amazing city! Very well located close from mainly attractions and Bay Sands shopping center and resort. Our soon in 20th floor had a great view to the bay and a perfect space to relax, the bathroom also had a great size with a bathtub also with panoramic view to the bay. The buffet for breakfast and dinner is amazing at the Colony with plenty dishes to choose. Also the pool area is a perfect place to relax and refresh after a nice walk in the city.  My only complaint was that  the elevators noise besides our room (2018) didn’t make our stay perfect.",4,March 2019,
"As a frequent Marriott traveller, AVOID",Ang L,"The view was good, that's about it. One of the most frustrating Marriott experiences I have ever had.  I used mobile check-in a couple of hours before I arrived at the hotel and it showed that I got a suite upgrade. But at the hotel soon after, I was told they have rolled back my upgrade. They put me in a slightly better than regular room eventually, but not the suite, which would have been fine had they not promised me one thing and changed their mind the last minute :(  Then my room card didn't work, after 16 hours of flight, and the upgrade shenanigans, that was just not what I needed....  Then at checkout, the frontdesk then says this is not a ""participating hotel"" so I won't accrual any points for this stay. And nobody mentioned this upon checking in...  Oh, the bar closes…",2,April 2019,
An Amazing Place to Celbrate a Special Birthday!,Bruce H,"My wife Pat and I recently had the distinct pleasure to spend four nights at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia and to dine at the Colony Resturant!

Caring on every level,Cindy G,"Having stayed in the hotel for 6 days with my daughter,  I can only compliment the hotel and it’s staff.  We had the wonderful harbour view rooms, which are bright, modern spacious and they have THE VIEW!!! Wonderful to go to bed and wake up looking at this part of Singapore.  As for the hotel staff, I can only say how spot on they were. Yes we have stayed a bit longer, which allowed us getting to know them.  On a day to day basis at the bar in the evening  or at the breakfast in the morning we felt cared for.  Everybody (!!!) was polite, kind and quick to attend our needs and they smile which gives you a warm and welcome feeling all around.  Especially thank you to Murphie, Connie, Gnana and so many more!  Best wishes to everybody!  Cindy & V.L.  ",5,April 2019,
Absolutely Perfect.,Holly W,"Everything about this experience was phenomenal. We're Platinum Elite members with Marriott Bonvoy, and were hesitant to book this hotel as they do not participate in the program. Even though we didn't get the nights/points, they are part of the Fine Hotels & Resorts with Amex, so we decided to go for it. And I'm so glad we did!   Our flight arrived at 8am, and coming off of 18 hours of international travel, my biggest concern was being able to check in early/shower/get settled. I contacted the hotel about a month in advance to find out if we'd be able to check in early... they were so friendly and let me know that they couldn't guarantee it, but that we'd have access to showers and have a place to store our luggage when we arrive. The concierge team emailed with me back and…",5,March 2019,
Excellent staff and Superb views,ernesto b,"I would like to compliment the staff at the Hotel for their professionalism and kindness during our recent stay.

Smooth check in - 21st Floor. Staff were all smiles and that is indeed a pleasure in itself. I booked the Marina Bay view room and I would RECOMMEND this. It may be slightly pricier than the other view but totally worth it. I entered the room and was WOWed by the view. I spent the first 40 mins of entering the room just admiring the view and taking pictures.   The room in itself is very spacious. The bathroom and the view from the tub is to die for. Amazing. I had also requested for the Butler-drawn bath with rose petals (you have 3 options to choose from - a Couple one with Champagne etc is also available). The bath was arranged beautifully.

Sunday Buffet Lunch,740Elly48,"Outstanding food from many cultures. It is easy to see why all the tables were booked out and reservations are required. Fresh and innovative food, seafood, meat,  vegetarian, many cooked to order and the supply kept coming. Apart from the many savoury offerings, the dessert table was delicious along with the hand made chocolates and if cheese is your thing, the cheese display was magnificent. Along with the delicious champagne and special cocktail made that day, the attentive service from the waiters, the attractive dining room with Chihuly glass works on the wall, we could not have asked for anything better.",5,March 2019,
Location & Service!,Jorissen,"It was my first time to Singapore and I was in between Marina Bay Sands or the Ritz Carlton, and my choice did not disappoint. First off the view from my room was priceless, rooms were big and spacious and their iconic soaking bathtub with the marina view was magical.  The location was just right with connecting malls and metro and its fairly easy to travel to places like Fullerton hotel or the Merlion Park. What's more, we are a few minutes away from Singapore's metro system which brings us straight to the City and Orchard Road!  The club at Ritz Carlton was nothing short but luxurious. The food varieties and spread in the buffet were more than what I eat on a daily basis!! Everyone in the lounge was friendly and so attentive to every guest! I was taken aback when they greeted…",5,February 2019,

Ask and pay for the Marina BY view as the evening lightshow and the skyline is worth the price. The staff went far beyond the call of duty to help us navigate restaurants, sights, etc. I. particular, Amira, at guest relations, went the distance, leaving us a note in our room filled with suggestions of her favorite places.

Second Visit - Perfection Again,LuxeFamilyFun,"What a great experience!  The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore is a superior property.  The location is the best - with a prime position to frame the famous Singapore Marina area - the Sands Casino on one edge of the sight line and the downtown skyline on the other side of the marina.  Waking up to that beauty every morning is almost overwhelming - at night the lights on the iconic images are something to behold.  Pro tip: Pay the extra money to have a marina view so you can witness this for yourself.  It costs a bit more but is worth it.  Also, the club level features (concierge, food and drinks) are also worth investing in if you are a routine breakfast eater or interested in a nightcap without leaving the property.  The service is exceptional throughout.  The pool is gorgeous…",5,March 2019,

Hubby & I were not best pleased & eventually after much negotiation, they managed to find a room for us on the 28th floor. It turned out to be a fabulous suite overlooking the Marina.

Beware - Does Not Recognize Marriott Reward Members,SSWilliams,"I do not recommend this hotel to Marriott Reward Members; here is my personal experience.

On March 13th I sent an email to Ritz-Carlton Singapore with a question regarding an early arrival; I was surprise at the response I received from the ERS Executive at Ritz-Carlton Singapore stating that Marriott Reward members get NO benefits (club access/early-late check in/points) at Ritz-Carlton Singapore.

We were granted access to our rooms for an early check in - this is always a nice surprise and they had upgraded our suites to better suites as a happy 25 year anniversary surprise!  The suites are lovely, spacious and comfortable.  This hotel has the most delicious cocktails and mocktails + I personally feel their take on the Singapore Sling is the best I've ever had.

Not up to standard,Xavier722013,"Stayed for business. Lobby area and 3 lower levels are in good condition and sumptuous. Staff at the coffee area are attentive and polite.   The rooms however are in bad need of an upgrade. For the price the quality is not there. Seems like they are “sweating the assets” as much as possible. The three nights I stayed I had to ask for them to come and clean the room as by 1600 hrs nobody had come!!!   Their spa is nice but the air conditioning is so low that you freeze. Not really good for relaxing. Also they have the music on too load and despite various requests to lower it they did not. Perhaps they confused the spa for a disco!?

Unforgettable dining experience,Christine R.,"We had lunch at The Colony for my brother’s birthday last week. It was one of the best dining experiences my family has had.  The food was exquisite. There was a lot of variety, and all the dishes were elegantly prepared and tasted beautiful. The highlights for me were the prime rib roast, roast duck, fresh seafood, singapore spring rolls and the special noodles one of the chefs prepared for my brother.   If you are planning to dine here, I’d recommend skipping breakfast and arriving early so you can sample a lot of the  food.   My family was also very impressed with the faultless service.

Stunning views saved the day,MidLifeCrisis,"3rd time at Ritz Carlton Millenia, stayed one night at a Deluxe Kallang Room. Stunning views, super Instagramable.  Very comfy bed but furniture starting to shows some age. There were patches of paint of the shower head, and the floor was  uneven and ‘squeeky’ at some areas. Service by the reception and concierge were good, but what was disappointing and unacceptable was that nothing was done by the hotel although it was conveyed earlier that the stay was to celebrate a birthday. Sure it was not a given and some may say I am a cheap-skate nobody, but I expected more from a Ritz Carlton property. In fact, this is probably the first time I have stayed anywhere in the world to celebrate a special event, and no effort was made by the hotel to commemorate the occasion (we went Suntec…",3,March 2019,

The grounds are well kept and staff from front desk, to concierge to doorman/woman (and there were ALOT of them) were on their game.  Always smiling, always helpful, never put out with a question or request.    The room was gorgeous.  We overlooked the Bay through the enormous wall of window with about 1/2 of the Singapore Flyer in our view.  The room was quite large with a King sized…",5,January 2019,
Very good hotel and really top service and hospitality at the club lounge level,Heiko F,"I have been to Singapore a number of times and being at the Ritz in Singapore is like coming home. I used to stay in the Club lounge level. The team members and their efforts making the difference to other luxury hotels. The head of the Club lounge is Sheila - Great hospitaliy and always welcoming and supporting my wishes. I have had a marina bay view which is wonderful. Just sitting in the room and appreciate the view ...  Rooms are spacious and bath tub with window to overlook the marina. Big rooms in comparison to other hotels in Singapore. Walking distance to the Sands hotel (infinity pool and great bar, casino etc.) You can use the club lounge for meetings as well and is a perfect location to meet business partners and colleagues.",5,January 2019,
Excellent service from start to finish!,M.Q,"We were greeted well by Karen at the reception.  She and her colleague Roystance took really good care of us and helped us with a few requests. We were first staying at the Marina Bay Sands, but changed hotel because of the overcrowding and inpersonal touch! I can strongly recommend The Ritz Millenia Singapore and will definitely be back!",5,February 2019,
Personalised Excellence,TheTraveller,"The Club Level offers luxury and personal choice.  The staff led by Sheila and Chuck ensured all your needs were met.  In saying this it should be noted that all staff from the check-in, dining experience and the housekeeping were friendly and highly skilled in their roles. The pool area offered an oasis from the hectic pace of Singapore. Confirmation of this amazing experience was in meeting numerous travellers, families and couples, who come back every year to the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore.",5,February 2019,
Beautiful Your,nicolealex89,Stayed here for a week on business.  Hotel is beautiful and location is great for walking to many sights.  Rooms are large and pool was amazing.  Wonderful service. Would definitely stay here again.  Pool is beautiful.,5,February 2019,
Beyond Expectations - Staff and Buffet Heads Above the Rest,Dan Korman,"When you book a room at a Ritz-Carlton anywhere in the world, you know you’re booking a nice room at a flagship hotel. But the staff at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia were hands down the most kind-hearted, attentive, and hospitable professionals I’ve ever encountered in my travels (sorry Komeneka ;). Whether it was Lee Lee and Kharti providing custom items at the AMAZING breakfast buffet (literally the best buffet in the world) or Ricardo on the housekeeping team ensuring we had extra waters for our pool time, each person we encountered seemed eager and excited to assist. If you’re traveling to Singapore and haven’t made up your mind on where to stay, the Ritz on Raffles will surely make your vacation. (Side note: the Chihuly Lounge is wonderful, but don’t order an “Irish Coffee”…",5,February 2019,
EXEMPLARY !!,JaneP,"Once again i returned to the fabulous Ritz Carlton Hotel in Singapore. This time to celebrate my mothers 80th birthday. The wonderful ,friendly ,kind staff , lead by Sheila and Chuck went beyond my expectations to ensure my mother had the most memorable stay. From organising our room close to the lifts, providing a beautiful birthday cake and banner to everyday making us feel so welcome and special. The rooms are so spacious and clean and the food in the entire hotel is exemplary!!! I will not be staying anywhere else when I return to Singapore.",5,February 2019,
Excellent service at Chihuly Lounge,OLCmong,"I had hi tea buffet with my girlfriends and thumbs up for the service crews! They are fully attentive, highly professional, warm and welcoming! I would like to specially compliment the service staff, Dunstan. He is knowledgeable, gave us an introduction of the various tea flavors, and constantly checking if we needed extra top up of our drinks and if we needed any further assistance! We felt so comfortable and welcoming that we continue to stay on after hi tea and ordered wine. Highly recommend to visit Chihuly Lounge! The staff are well mannered, well trained and it was a superb dining experience for my galfriends and myself!! ",5,February 2019,
Superb,LondonPieman,We spent two nights here in a club room and everything was fantastic.   The club lounge is superb....probably the best club lounge we have ever been in.  Special thanks to Sheila in the lounge.  Well done to the management team.  You are running a fantastic hotel.  If you are going to Singapore then you should pick this hotel.  I guarantee you won’t be disappointed.,5,February 2019,
Superb!,Emanuela883,"The night buffet is fantastic. Lobster and oysters are the best. Wide choice of different cuisine, the ambience is sophisticated and elegant. The Chinese corner is outstanding in order of quality of food and choice ",5,February 2019,
What a beautiful property!,Ángel A,"I had the pleasure in staying at this “Beautiful” property for 3 days whilst I conducted a site visit. This property by far is the Best of the Best. They still carry the old traditional real Ritz Carlton values and customer service. I’m talking when the Ritz was the Ritz before being purchased by Marriott.   Every staff member that encountered provided me stellar service with a smile. I truly enjoyed the decor of the property and the fine outlets that they have.   The serounding area activities only added to what became a picture perfect property.   If ever you are contemplating a vacation in Singapore and you’re researching a hotel to stay, STOP! Why research. I just have you your answer!!  I will be back in March and unfortunately they have assigned me to stay at Marina Sands…",5,February 2019,
Wonderful Surprise,J H  H,"Full disclosure... we always have stayed at Raffles while in Singapore, but due to its closure for renovation (much needed I must add), we decided to try the Ritz-Carlton Millenia.  We opted for a glorious deluxe one bedroom concierge level suite and were absolutely thrilled with the gorgeous accommodation, stunning Marina views and superb concierge level support, not to mention the wonderful breakfast, lunch and cocktail hour food and beverages in the lounge.    A complimentary car service is also available to take you to nearby sights, etc. (on first come/first serve basis).  The hotel is very well located, and convenient to almost anything you want...nice that it is attached to the Millenia Mall too.  All the amenities, including Asprey toiletries, lovely turn down service,…",5,January 2019,
Beautiful hotel and great service!,Warren G,The rooms were fantastic (especially the bathrooms) with fantastic views of the city! The staff was excellent and a special thanks to Aylmer Tan for making a special effort to make us feel welcome and like VIPs.

Best hotel in Singapore,LizzieTilda,"Stayed here for 4 nights on business.   Having been to Singapore more times than I can remember and stayed at a number of top class hotels, the Ritz Carlton is now my new favourite.  The levels of service are outstanding across the whole team (from check-in onwards).  Although they don’t participate in the Marriott Rewards (my only gripe) they still offered me a late check out and upgraded my room.  The room was on a corner and had amazing views over both the marina and the city.  Now, to the real good stuff.  The breakfast buffet was the best I have seen and that is saying something being as I have stayed at some of the best hotels across the whole of Asia.  From the choice of Chinese, Indian, Japanese, local, Western, pastries, desserts, dumplings, ice-cream etc. etc. etc.,…",5,February 2019,
Amazing Stay,UdSe,Beautiful property with amazing staff especially Diana from Guest Relations. The rooms are so amazing that it makes staying at any other hotels miserable. Lunch buffet at Colony was also very delicious and extensive. Regret not staying in a Club room!,5,April 2018,
Extraordinary Service,Jumanri L,"Just wanted to acknowledge the extraordinary accommodation that was extended to us by Sandrine Qu, who has gone above and beyond in order to satisfy our cravings for dim sum.  We must also mention Chun Wei and Angel of Summer Pavilion, who prepared us the most sumptuous dim sum we’ve ever tasted.  These individuals have surely made a difference for their exceptional service.",5,February 2019,
Amazing hotel with great service,capung,Cant think of a single negative thing about this hotel. Everything was perfect. Even though it was very busy but service was 10 out of 10 and staff were super helpful and gone beyond their job to make guests feel welcomed and happy,5,February 2019,
Almost perfect,RJ CANADA S,We stayed in the millennia 1 bedroom suite with the most amazing views I’ve ever seen before the hotel was gorgeous and clean modern touch   The club lounge was excellent and Tina the concierge in the club was amazing really went above and beyond our expectations did everything for us possible   You can basically eat every meal in the lounge if you want part of the lounge perks   The colony buffet downstairs may be one of the most epic buffets I’ve ever  experienced and was only 30 usd per person  The staff was really amazing everything was smooth and perfect the whole stay besides 2 very rude bell boys or parking staff they worked at the front door PK Vijayaregunathan and  Raimonjit Singh as we came back from walking the marina one day and I asked a simple question to which…,5,February 2019,
Door ajar,Warren C,"I took my mother to Singapore to celebrate her 70th birthday and we decided to splurge a little and checked in at this hotel. I have to say it is a beautiful hotel with a great view (if your room is facing Marina Bay). The staff are helpful and always greet you with a smile. You have easy access to 3 shopping centres (Millenia Walk, Marina Square, and Suntec City) and Promenade MRT station. Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands are also within walking distance.  I hate to share anything negative about the hotel. However, I must say it is rather odd that during the 3 nights we stayed there, there were twice that after turn down services, the door was left ajar.  Make sure you take a good bath in the tub enjoying the breathtaking view if you have the chance to stay here.",4,January 2019,
Stunning views and efficient service,RobRoy88,"Stayed in January and booked this via Amex FHR scheme, which meant we were upgraded to a room with a view of Marina Bay: and what a view it was! Spectacular day and night. The room was extremely well-appointed, with a super-comfortable bed (one of the best we have slept in), plenty of sockets for charging, a generous sofa, a dressing room where cases could be stored, and the bathroom was enormous and spotless.Food-wise, we ate breakfast in Colony (a buffet-style set-up, but on agrand scale) as part of the deal, and used our FHR credit towards dinner there, too. Service was impeccable, and the food of a very good standard. It seemed permanently busy, too, which is always a good sign! We were just passing through Singapore for a couple of nights but had time to walk to the Gardens…",5,January 2019,
Another amazing stay at the Ritz..,Cinnamoncrunch,"It seems somewhat impossible but the Ritz Carlton in Singapore just gets better and better each time we return. They refurbished/changed around some parts of the rooms, the express check in process is extremely quick (less than a minute) and painless, every single staff member you interact with is friendly+helpful+polite. It’s Chinese New Year this time that we visited and the hotel is full of guests, there are many staff at the lobby greeting everyone and ensuring things are going smoothly. We had our reunion dinner at Summer Pavilion which was well-executed and delicious (although the YuSheng could have been more creatively decorated), and then drinks/dessert at Chihuly lounge. The waitresses were attentive and got us everything we wanted.  When we requested for butter from…",5,February 2019,
This might well be the most perfect hotel in the world!,Stina1978,"Hands down, this is the best hotel we have ever stayed in (and, mind you, we are well travelled). And this even have nothing to do with us being upgraded to a gorgeous suite :)  The location is great. This was our 4th time in Singapore and we always prefer Marina Bay area to stay in. You have plenty of sights to keep yourself busy within 15 min walk or a short taxi ride. Two MRT stations are also within 5 min walk.   The service provided is top-notch. We have booked a club level room and upon arrival we were taken for the check-in to the top floor lounge, offered a glass of bubbly, upgraded to a lovely suite and overall made feel extremely welcome and at home. Sheila at the Club was very friendly and made sure our stay was flawless.  We stayed in a lovely corner suite, with…",5,January 2019,

Six Star Experience,Christina M,"I could not have asked for a more peaceful, hospitable experience than I experienced at the Ritz Carlton Millenia. Elements of surprise were incorporated into our 6 night stay, such as a fresh fruit platter with a handwritten note sent to our room by Ryan Ng. Additionally, Alvin Tan, part of the spa and fitness center staff, was exquisitely attentive and went above and beyond to supersede every request! Specifically, he would inform us of the best times to take pictures at the pool, and even took the liberty of posing us and showing his photography skills! Alvin sent a hand crafted bouquet of beautiful red roses to my room on my birthday, and the day before checking out, he brought us a handwritten note along with two heart shaped lollipops. We received commensurate,…",5,January 2019,

Exceeded our Expectations by miles!,NewYorkYogi,"We normally don't stay at big hotels, we are more into small boutique hotels but decided to give the Ritz in Singapore a try and I can't say enough good about. Our room was great with fantastic views of the marina, marina bay sands and the ferris wheel. very tasteful rooms, not overdone with a million patterns (a curse of most big hotels) but simple elegant spaces, oriented to the views. Great bathrooms and wonderful breakfast. What truly sets a great hotel apart though is the service one receives there. It is here that the Ritz truly excels. Everyone from the bellman who helped us depart our taxi and walked us to reception, was extremely professional, polite, friendly and bent over backwards to be as helpful as possible.

Outstanding hotel in Singapore,margaritagirl2017,"I had an amazing 3 day stay at the RC Millenia a week ago.  I'm looking for a new go to hotel now that my usual haunt was taken over by Accor for my 2-3 trips per year to Singapore.  I have nothing but good things to say about the RC.  The staff was incredibly attentive and professional, yet very friendly.  My suite was gorgeous and well appointed with an amazing view of MBS.  The buffet breakfast was among the top 5 that I've ever had in Asia, and nothing tops an Asian buffet.  I forgot my glasses in the restaurant one day, and they were returned to me on a towel elephant.  How fun and whimsical!  I will definitely be back.",5,January 2019,
Still one of the best in Singapore,LaoK66,"It’s my first time back to Ritz Carlton Millenia since 1997 when it was new.  I was glad to find that it maintains still its charm and excellent service.  Room: even after 20+ years the room was well maintained, very comfortable and well attended by the housekeeping team. If your budget allows get the Marina Bay View Room.  Gorgeous view of the bay with Marina Sands hotel and skylines of financial district as its backdrop and water/light show in the evening as a bonus.   Service: highest quality one can find in the world, every staff was friendly, professional, and considerate.

Can I come back?,JustinG,"This was our first time staying at the Ritz Millenia on our trip of Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong. We arrived by taxi and were greeted by the bell service who took our bags and personally brought us to the reception. Reception was busy as the hotel has many visitors, but we only waited about 5 minutes. The lady who checked us in brought us to the elevators afterwards.  Room:  We stayed in a city view room while our family stayed in the Marina Bay View. The views are breathtaking. It bears repeating:  the views are breathtaking. Both rooms had incredible sights, albeit the Marina Bay view is better ;). It was an amazing experience to wake up in the morning, push a button, and have the curtains open up to the world allowing the sunlight to come in.  The bathroom is amazing with…",5,January 2019,
Great hotel.. THE place to stay in Singapore,BrunswickTraveller,"I have been staying here for 20 years and it never disappoints. The hotel has evolved over time and is constantly improving the guest experience. These are the largest hotel rooms in the city and beautifully appointed. Great views and stunning bathrooms. The pool is simply superb and a great gym too. The Colony restaurant is a true highlight with an amazing breakfast feast, clearly expertly managed. The incredible artwork throughout the property is impressive. Given its perfect location and exacting service standards I wouldn’t risk staying anywhere else in Singapore. ",5,January 2019,
"Brilliant view, excellent room and facilities.",Steve H,"Just what you would expect from a hotel of this standing. Excellent. Good location, easy walk into town. Staff were very accommodating and arranged a late checkout without fuss. If I was *forced* to pick something to fault it was that the staff were a little too invasive at times. That's a very personal thing - I know some people like being fussed over (and expect it at this price point).",5,November 2018,

We were fast asleep very quickly thanks to her excellent care! Added to that, she sent us a lovely note the next evening with some delicious treats. She personifies the exceptional service at the Ritz. The rooms are beautiful, with floor to ceiling windows that display the beauty of Singapore in a magnificent way!

Perfect Location with Amazing Views,thereKarengoes,Went for NYE and stayed almost a week at the Ritz. It's just across the street and a convenient pedestrian bridge (Helix) to the Marina Bay Sands where there is tons of shopping and restaurants. Upgraded to the Club Suite and were thrilled we did. Ended up cancelling two dinner reservations and dining up there because of the delicious food (theme changed every night) and the incredible service and the most beautiful view ever. This club is worth every penny. We had breakfast included with our package at the Colony restaurant downstairs but it is a buffet and pretty busy and we just did not want to fight for food -- up in the club was the perfect breakfast with omelet/egg station.The staff are the best and even sent a wonderful amenity and note during our stay. When we would head…,5,January 2019,
Great time at the lounge,Eunice L,Had the most memorable time in Ritz Carlton Singapore. Me & my girlfriend went to Chihuly lounge to have drinks and watched the live music. Daniel sang & performed so well and everyone was dancing even though it was the lobby lounge. Staff was amazing and we were served by the manager Sandrine. So kind of her to check on us as we were all so happy and high from drinks. That explains the great cocktails from the Bartenders! Glad that we went there .! Highly recommend !,5,December 2018,

Best of the best of the best,PETER C. PARK,"For this review, I put Mar. 2018 as travel period, but it was actually Mar.2014.(Review is for within-a-year experience, I guess). Trip was with my mother and family (one boy and wife) It was to celebrate our wedding anniversary and 1st. birthday of my son together. We made a trip to Singapore because city is safe, clean and convenient to move around for both old lady and an infant.   Hotel experience was just amazing - impeccable. Partially, it's because we got upgraded to Suite with great great view of Marina Bay, but it's not just that. Lunch at Summer Pavilion was fantastic and High Tea experience was something you cannot get everywhere. Best part was people. Employees we met every corner of the hotel always smiled and ready to help us any time. Those whole things came to me…",5,March 2018,

Best stay ever,DropAnchor,"We booked with Amex Fine Hotels and we were effortlessly checked in at 7:30 a.m.!! And upgraded to an amazing room. Their view of the bay from the suite’s sitting room and bedroom was spectacular and also from the tub, the city view was amazing. From the beginning, Rachel treated us like royalty - we cannot overstate her warmth and hospitality- especially surprising us with treats sent to our room.  We felt the staff were all wonderful but Rachel Zhou and her colleague, Fatya, went FAR beyond to make sure we felt welcome, and they were just delightful. The staff at the most spectacular breakfast buffet ever were also amazing. The room, view, location and amenities were all perfect and I can’t wait to return!",5,December 2018,
Very helpful staff,Inftraveller,"The staff here do go out of their way to help. The rooms are large and very comfortable. I found it unfortunate that the TV is mounted in such a way that viewing it from the bed causes a crick in the neck. The TV also experienced frequent glitches when no picture was visible. Sound proofing could be better - a child screaming nearby was clearly audible, as was what sounded like a stampeding herd of horses on the floor above.",4,January 2019,

Reservation experience,campSingapore,"Totally appalled by the service I received today in person. Perhaps my reservation was too simple and of not much value. Two rooms and buffet lunch for 10 pax. You may ask why I didn't make a reservation online? Because of non responsiveness to my enquiry 3 weeks ago. Front desk service received was as if it was from a 3 star hotel establishment. Despite knowing my enquiry and situation, Front desk requested for my contact details and he will arrange someone from the restaurant to contact me. As for my room reservation, he said the walk in price and online price are the same.  I need to suggest to him to find out for me whether his restaurant manager is available. After handling me to the restaurant section, this guy is no where to be found. I have to head back to the Front desk…",3,January 2019,
LOVED IT!  Especially the Lounge!,Bulldog0007,"We truly enjoyed our time at the Ritz!  Excellent service, and a fantastic buffet (ate way too much).  What we enjoyed the most is our time in the lounge in the evenings.  Daniel Park is a brilliant musician and has an amazing voice.  We spent way more time listening to him than we had planned on but time well spent.  Sandrine Qu is the Assistant Manager in the Lounge and she couldn't have been more gracious and helpful.  She even took us on a tour of all of the beautiful artwork that is on display in the hotel.    Highly recommended!",5,January 2019,
Beautiful Suite,ExecMama,"Stayed at the Ritz and was in a beautiful suite. I loved the bed! It was very high making it interesting to get into, I am taller at 5'8 but still had to hop but it was sooooo comfortable.   It was minutes from the orchid garden which was lovely.

The rating is based on the club lounge.,nitejas,"My family and I just had a great stay at the ritz Carlton.  We had club rooms, so cannot say anything really about the rest of the hotel, as when we weren’t out in Singapore we were in the lounge.  The lounge was brilliant with alcoholic drinks being served all day and cocktails from 5:30pm. The staff were great, and the food selection was nice (but could be hit and miss). The view from the lounge is spectacular. We also used the lounges limo to get around a bit, but were confused at points on why they were okay to drop us off in some places but not others.  The hotel rooms were lovely, especially the bathroom with a massive window with a view. The placement of the hotel is great as we mostly walked everywhere we needed to from it. ",5,January 2019,

The checking in was flawless and nothing was too much trouble and our room was ready even though it was only 10am.  The suite itself was the Milenia One Bedroom Suite and it was stunning just perfect.  The Club room was fantastic and the breakfast options were varied, enough to suit any palate.

One of my favourite hotels in the world,HelB1981,"The ritz is hard to beat - especially if you splash out on a marina facing club room. The room itself is large and beautifully designed and having a bath with a view is a real luxury. Very comfortable and huge bed, great black-out blinds... all you need for a good night’s sleep. The club lounge is lovely and has a great view. Nice assortment of food available, lovely service (friendly chef too!) and good wines. Location is great - near promenade MRT station and just across the helix bridge from the marina bay sands complex and close to the esplanade theatres. Only thing they don’t offer which, for example, the mandarin oriental does, is guaranteed late check out for club room guests - but I asked for one and got one so I can’t complain!

Ritz-Carlton Singapore should NOT be a flagship,chadf305,"When writing this review for the first time, I don’t know where to begin.   The great: Prakash, Noelle, Christine and Rachel - those team members worked hard to make our stay a good stay.   The bad:  Royson - an employee that should be immediately terminated for yelling at a guest.   Upon arriving to the hotel via their transfer I was escorted right up to my room for check in. As I always book through Amex fine hotel and resorts I inquired as to the status of my upgrade. Royson yelled at me like I was a school child who stepped out of line. My first impression of, what I was told, was the nicest hotel in Singapore was being yelled at by an employee. I understand that NYE is a busy night but I was a guest. A simple explanation would have sufficed.   Upon realizing I’d be staring…",3,January 2019,
Very Close to Perfect,RGA,"Rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable. The decor was slightly outdated but overall in great shape and well taken care of. Fluffy carpets are hard to clean. Staff was outstanding and always super friendly and professional.  Location is also perfect for walking, running, shopping, sightseeing. ",5,November 2018,
You're Made to Feel at Home Straight Away,Peter S,"Staff at this hotel have been trained to be pleasant, friendly and attentive. I have to say it. Everyone was so nice. Everyone was so helpful. Both sides of the hotel give excellent views of the city and it is centrally located/walking distance to shopping malls, the Singapore Eye, subway station, Gardens By The Bay and the huge Marina Bay Sands and attendant shopping malls. One thing though if eating at the amazing Colony Restaurant don't expect a free table on arrival, make sure you book. This amazing buffet restaurant was very difficult to get a meal in. Breakfast in the Colony was an extravagant experience and possibly alone worth the cost of staying at The Ritz.",5,December 2018,
Birthday Celebration,MOH A R,"Back for a staycation to celebrate the birthday of an immediate family member.

I know it is a 5 star hotel .. but for that Ritz Carlton .. it is a 7 star .. the service .. the environment.. the rooms .. the view .. every single thing was perfect.. the breakfast is wonderful..  the most important part is the staff and how friendly and supportive.. I can list all of them here .. but believe me they all deserve the appreciation,5,December 2018,
Close to marina,Kweesey,The hotel is walking distance to marina sands and garden by the bay.  Nice and big buffet spread with both local and international dishes.   The rooms and facilities are a bit dated and needs updating.  Slow service and arrival experience can be smoother.,4,November 2018,
Warm service at Chihuly Lounge,Wynn,I have recently visited Chihuly several times over the past weeks and would like to commend Sandrine Qu for her warm hospitality and great service. She is quick to attend to us whenever we needed something and never reject any requests made. We also enjoyed good conversations with her.   The lounge has also become very vibrant with Daniel Park's beautiful singing.  We will certainly be back for more!!,5,December 2018,
Delicious!,Carina T,We had a fantastic familydinner! Everything was perfect. Staff is very proffessional and friendly. The colonial buffet had everything you wanted. Seafood was excellent! The japanese food outstanding.  We highly recommend this restaurant!,5,December 2018,

LUXURY IS FADING- TIME FOR UPGRADE,jamanews,"FIRST IMPRESSION.....is crucial when you checked into any hotel and experience things that are NOT supposed to be present in a luxury property.  We paid big money to stay at the Ritz Carlton for my Special Birthday in October 2018. The room we were first assigned had a number of defects related to poor maintenance; including stained lounge chairs, rusty plug hole in bathroom and filthy bathroom floor and low hot water pressure, worn room furniture and cheap rough toilet papers.  The duty manager Alvin and Front Office Manager, Evan Chiang were prompt and apologetic with their responses.  We were relocated  to another room that was far superior in quality and upkeep, plus befitting the high price we paid for our stay.  The managers also provided complimentary treats, dinner for…",3,October 2018,
Great hotel with excellent resturant and lounge,Ben,"This is my second time at the Chihuly Lounge at the Ritz Carlton. Service was excellent once again. My girl Sandrine, the assistanr manager, hooked us up again with excellent service!!! It was my birthday so she brought out a slice of cake while the seductive voice of Daniel Park sang happy birthday. If you want a really good cup of tea, ask for Sandrine's tea. It pairs well with the cake or any sweets. Make sure you ask for Sandrine, she will make sure you are taken care of!!!",5,December 2018,

Rooms look like they’ve been refurbished as the hotel is more than 20 years old. Nice living area and super comfy bed. Good lighting all around and the view at night is just amazing.  Bathroom is very spacious with a big tub with a view of the city. WI-FI connection is superfast upto 200Mbps.   If you’re into fitness the gym facilities are on par with any modern gym.

Definitely one of the finest hotels in Singapore!,Peter H,"Absolutely loved my stay at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore. I got a fantastic high-floor room overlooking the Marina Bay!!! The room was very comfortable and very clean.  The food at the buffet restaurant on the first floor was outstanding- both the breakfast and dinner options.   What i most appreciated was the personalized service- I got multiple handwritten ""welcome"" and ""how are you doing"" notes from the guest relations team. MOST IMPRESSIVELY, the guest relations team inadvertently found out that I was a fan of the DC and Marvel comic book movies, and that I was planning to see the Aquaman movie which came out on the day of my arrival...and lo and behold, when I came back from the movie, I found a large poster of the Aquaman movie plus a kind guest relations note…",5,December 2018,
You cannot beat the view at night.,David Herd,We arrived after dinner but we had club room privileges which we used as well as having breakfast there because we had to leave early (7:30).  Breakfast was available at 6:30. The view out our window was surrounded by tall building lit up and many other features along the bay.  The Marina Hotel sat off in the distance,5,December 2018,
Impeccable service and beautiful music at Chihuly Lounge,Jessica,"I've been a frequent visitor to Summer Pavilion at the Ritz Carlton and have hardly patronized any other F&B outlets within the hotel until a recent visit to Chihuly Lounge.   I was warmly welcomed by Assistant Manager, Sandrine Qu, who was ready to give her recommendations for food and drinks, all of which were very good. As I was by myself on a recent visit, she made me feel really at home and not alone at all.   The very talented Daniel Park was also really entertaining and was ready to take on any songs requests.  I now have another go to place at the Ritz Carlton, thanks to the wonderful team at Chihuly Lounge. Keep up the good work!",5,December 2018,

Amazing stay - again ...,rajsantiago,This review is becoming a broken record for us whenever we stay at the Ritz . The service and experience - once again - was exceptional . So much so that we missed the Ritz when we moved to park Hyatt  @ Tokyo(which in itself is nice hotel but we loved the service from Ritz better). Special thanks to Evan Chiang for assisting us on the late checkout - it really assisted us as we are travelling with two small children.,5,December 2018,

This hotel keeps on improving,653waichil,"We stayed 4 nights in an Elevated Kallang Room with breakfast. The view, especially at night, was breathtakingly beautiful. Room is spacious and relaxing. However the king size bed was too soft and not really comfortable for my back. My wife liked it though. We will choose twin beds next time. The bathroom is large and bright, and can accommodate two people easily. Good shower facilities, and the bath, with bath salt provided, was quite a luxury. Only setback was the tiny toilet cubicle inside the bathroom, which was a bit frightening in fact. No bidet facility. Vanity mirror was very good. The ventilation system in the toilet was too weak. Room was very clean. Bottled water, tea and coffee were replaced daily. Housekeeping service could not be faulted. The gym and the pool were…",5,December 2018,

Beautiful Art Museum,Michael K,"We did not stay at the hotel, but we had heard about their art collection, and that they welcomed tourists who were not guests at the hotel, so we went to see it.  Not only were we welcomed, but the concierge gave us a beautiful booklet, describing the art work, together with a map of where to find various pieces.  Very interesting and beautiful stuff.  The hotel itself is gorgeous with a lot of Chihuly glassware, and a great looking bakery. The hotel was a little hard for us to find, even using Google maps, as it is one of the few hotels in Singapore, it seems, that does not have its name emblazoned on some gigantic sign outside!",5,November 2018,
Charming,Petri,"We stayed in Ritz-Carlton for a few days during our holiday. We had an elevated kallang room with a gorgeous view of the river side. The room was spaceous and clean. There's a separate shower and a bathtub with a view.  The service in the hotel was very attentive. The location is also perfect, with easy walking access to Marina bay, MRT and few shopping malls. You also have to try the Colony restaurant, we didn't try the breakfast but the lunch buffet was really top quality.",4,November 2018,

The location is excellent if you want to be near to Marina Bay, Gardens-by-the-Bay and Suntec City. Easy covered connection to Marina Square and Millenia Walk. The Good: Room size, ambience, hospitality, spacious pool area. The Not-so-Good: WC cubicle rather claustrophobic, no hand bidet, shower water temperature fluctuates, TV controls not so user friendly, Will we stay again? We would, if there are no better value hotels around this locality.",4,December 2018,
Wonderful Hotel,EricPDC,"First visit to the excellent Ritz-Carlton and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

The buffet for breakfast was top quality with a wide ranging choice. The location was spot on with Marina Bay, the MRT and various malls in easy walking distance.

The staff couldn't have been more attentive, friendly and helpful.  I felt like I was at the Four Seasons about 20 years ago when things used to be overstaffed.  The pampering surprised me and was unexpected.  The Colony breakfast buffet was wonderful and our rooms had beautiful views, large and comfortable.  I did add another layer of fluff to the mattress, as it was quite hard (i prefer plush mattress feel).  The pool, fitness room, spa was again luxurious and pampering.  The proximity to everything was another big plus easy walking distance to gardens, marina sands, shopping, etc..  The afternoon high tea looked beautiful although we didn't have a chance to try it.

Stellar Hotel ~ home from home,Denise B,"We spent 5 days at the hotel at the end of November.  It is an exceptional hotel, but what makes it super special is the staff.  Absolutely no request was too much and the staff/concierges anticipated our needs before we even knew we had them!

The location on the bay is about one block from a metro station which means you can get anywhere in the city easily and inexpensively.  The view of the bay is wonderful.  The only quibble is that there is no pedestrian path up from the road in front of the hotel.  The rooms are large and well appointed. motorized drapes in both the sleeping room and the bathroom can completely block the light  The bed was comfy, the night tables were both interesting and effective with storage space below a transparent glass surface.

Service,Tom B,"I was in Singapore for the Marathon and saw that the Ritz was within easy walking distance (3 minutes) of the start-finish, and so impulsively moved hotels to make my already hard day a lot easier. Was it worth it?  In this instance, yes it was. It is the Ritz, after all, so the hotel itself starts at pretty fantastic. We booked a club room with a spectacular view of Marina Bay.  The club lounge is an all day experience in being pampered, both by the service and by the many delicacies on offer all day long.  It is Ritz, so it is also fairly expensive. If you want to splurge, and to be treated like royalty from arrival to departure, then this is your place.  There are, however, other choices around Marina Bay that are also excellent stays that you can have for half as much.",5,December 2018,

View is not everything,David K,"We stayed in a club premier suite for 3 nights. The suite interior was quite old fashioned but the view was just amazing. Compared the marina bay view from the suite in Marina Bay Sands we stayed a couple of years ago, the same view from Ritz looks much wider and better from a different angle. The suite was not big but still enough for us. The shower room was very small and the hair dryer was fixed to the wall in the bathroom. Apparently, it was uncomfortable for me just to stand there to dry my hair every day. The breakfast buffet at Colony was disappointing. Many choices but food quality was below average. Service was just a joke. We waited more than 30 minutes for a cup of tea. Waitresses always just stood together gossiping and ignored how many used plates on your table…",3,January 2018,
Worth it!,sugarrushida,"Planned a staycation at Ritz, we were greeted right upon arrival and our rooms was prepared promptly. As my birthday was nearing , the hotel had prepared a birthday cake and deco... I was really impressed with the birthday card as they had hand-drawn...it was really a personalised touch and it shows how attentive they are towards the guest. Dixom and the front desk team had provided warmth hospitality from the start...  Be it the hotel, be it the staff from the front desk to the Chihuly lounge...

They offer a variety of drinks and assorted beverages that will knock your socks off!  Sandrine Qu was in the lounge and was most helpful.  She took the time to show us some of the specialty drinks that they offer.  It added a touch of class that was a step above.  They also have musical sensation Daniel Park playing live music almost every night.  Great place for drinks with friends or a romantic night out with that special someone.

We were very well received and given a beautiful suite on a high floor with absolutely breathtaking views of the marina (and the of F1 viewing area). The Ritz Carlton Millenia is a massive property and it did feel a little impersonal. Whilst spacious and very comfortable (and obviously with stunning views) the rooms are starting to feel slightly dated. A few things that you would expect to find in your room weren't there; small things, like bath salts for example.

In major need of a face lift,Jones888,"The rooms are worn and dated. No USB ports, grubby furniture, no coffee maker (which is now very much standard in five star hotels globally), smoking floors (again basically phased out globally)  but I guess the Ritz needs to cater to ill mannered guests from the Middle Kingdom.   As a frequent corporate client for a decade I was shocked to check in at midnight and found my king size booking was changed to a twin. No offer for an upgrade but I could have a king sized bed in smoking room. Yeah, no thanks. Like sleeping in camp beds and they did smell much better either. Must be a lot of bed wetter here.  This my last stay at the Ritz Sing. You are a stain on the global franchise. Up Your Game ",1,November 2018,

Bright citylights make it hard to shut eye. 3. hubby birthday cake didnt come. 4. Set up a kids tent in the living hall but ended up blocking the entire space and adults keep tripping over the side. Tent is not child safe type. Had mental pieces and hook all around. Had to ask them to remove. 5.

Mastery of customer service: the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore (5-Star),L_T,"This time LT stayed with Ritz Carlton at the Millenia Singapore.  It is amazing to see its complete mastery of hospitality services.  At Check-in counter, the servicing staff spoke out his thoughts about trying to find me a best located room to fit my personal requirement, which made him look very helpful (and indeed he was).   While he drew out information from me, he “disguised” his questions as social conversations.   For instance,  when he knew that I would like to set morning calls at 6:30 am every day during my stay,  he looked at me with big eyes and asked if I was really there for a holiday.    After dinner, I went to the lobby launge for an after-dinner tea.  It was noted that the managress and waitresses walked frequently and systematically back and forth on the floor…",5,November 2018,
Singapore Super Star Hotel,ajgeb,"We only had one night at this fabulous property, and opted for the marina bay view room.  Oh my!  With the most spectacular views of Singapore's magnificent downtown, our room on the 9th floor was a perfect oasis of peace and relaxation.  The almost floor to ceiling glass window is easily shielded with a privacy screen or blackout curtain, all automatically lowered at the touch of a button.  The bathtub also has an electric screen, but once in the bathtub, you can raise the screen to further admire Singapore's skyline while lounging in the tub!

Absolutely Amazing stay at the Ritz Carlton Milenia Singapore!,Wander60208524763,"Spent an amazing week at the RC last month. Our first time in Singapore and we couldn't have stayed anywhere better. Fabulous hotel as one would expect from RCH. We had a Marina view room with sensational views of this beautiful city. Great central location. First class service from every single member of staff we met. Outstanding service from Sandrine Qu and her team, truly exemplary. They looked after us and treated us sooo very well making this a truly memorable holiday. Wonderful little touches left in our room which were very much appreciated.

Great music and great experience,Nanxiang S,"We checked into Ritz Singapore as just another Ritz. But Daniel Park's live music at the bar made a difference. One of the best music performance and voice we've heard for years and full of emotions too.

Sandrine and Daniel made the overall experience an unforgettable one.",5,November 2018,
Fabulous Sunday brunch,Daniella S,"Four of us came for brunch. The room had a great atmosphere. Nice background music to start and then a lovely acoustic singer continued. We chose pink champagne. There was a seafood section, huge fresh prawns and langoustines, sushi, lobster benedict. There was roasted lamb, duck, chicken curries, potatoes, stews. So much choice. Cheeses and fresh fruits. And there was a cocktail stand and we all were given the cocktail of the day, some sort of whiskey sour. Lovely desserts to finish.  It’s a pricey brunch but the quality is so good, and the atmosphere is so nice. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion or family day.",5,October 2018,

And to my surprise, she actually bring the icecream over to our table. I must say that she is a really nice and polite person. And for the names that was written on the sliding glass for the icecream, im glad that she actually wrote it in chinese too.

Really enjoyable stay at the Ritz-Carlton,samk2017101,"We travelled to Singapore in September and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton for 5 nights. The hotel is beautiful and our room was breathtaking, we woke up every morning with a massive view of Singapore. The staff were very friendly at the hotel, especially Ridhi who helped us from the first day we arrived. She made the stay very special, we would like to thank her for her hospitality and for the all the extra effort she went through for us. As we were staying for our honeymoon, the hotel gifted us with special treats every night, which was a really lovely thought. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the concierge were helpful in making arrangements and giving us ideas on what activities to take place in.

Personalized Service Set Ritz-Carlton Apart from Peer,curuleaedile,"When I checked in late at night rubbing my sore back from the long distance flight, the receptionist asked the housekeepers to send a bottle of red-flower oil (Chinese medicine for muscle cramp) to my room.  When I had a trip to the buffet breakfast station but forgot to take a pair of chopsticks, the server added a pair on my table without me asking.  This is what personal service is about.  There are many five-star hotels in the marina bay, Mandarin Oriental, Marina Sands, just to name a few.  I stayed in most of them.  What set Ritz apart from the rest is its personal service.",5,May 2018,

Both of us were extremely tired after the overnight flight and decided to request for our room again. This time I was told it would not be ready before 3pm!!! So we asked where we could rest (""just take a seat on the lounges""). We sat there (both falling asleep) for about an hour.

"Outstanding staff, room OK",,"First of all, let’s be clear about one thing. The staff are outstanding at every level and can’t do enough to assist you during your stay.   However I think the hotel is overpriced (one of the most expensive in Singapore). It location is on the intersection of two main roads, and the rooms feel a little dated. Also, the spectacular view of the marina was ruined by the fact that there was condensation on the outside of the windows for the whole time.  Whilst this is a great hotel, there are better hotels in its price range for sure",3,October 2018,

The hygiene levels - are a benchmark that other properties should live up to. The food and especially the buffet at the Colony Restaurant - is a huge scrumptious spread!

She wanted to find us a marina view room but they were fully booked and we were already grateful as we didn't expect any levels of upgrade.

Best Customer Service We Ever experienced,,"Just ended a six night stay at this hotel as part of a business/pleasure trip to Singapore. The hotel was modern and stunning, rooms were large with a great view. Wonderful gym, restaurants and location. Customer service was totally amazing. There were so many staff members that went the extra mile like Takahiro and Dickson. One example: there is only instant coffee in the room so my husband went on a serarch for 2 cups. Someone told him to go by the bar (where the cofffee is free). He thought they said to go to the bar and he bought 2 cups to go for an exhorbitant price. So while he was at his meeting I went down to investigate. Bottom line: 2 pots of coffee were sent to our room every morning at our desired time for free for the rest of our stay.

Impressive for a hotel with so many rooms how they still manage to make you feel special. Location of the hotel is convenient.

Always greeting you and smiling. We stayed at the time of the Grand Prix and it was crowded and a bit crazy but everything was still fantastic. The pool is fantastic and big!

Luxurious and relaxing stay,Angela Karen R,"Our family (two children 11,9) spent one night in a club room at Ritz Carlton during a stopover in Singapore. We arrived very early and were greeted warmly, welcomed to the club lounge for breakfast, given great advice regarding nearby activities. We were checked in early to our room (around 11.30) which was greatly welcomed after an overnight plane journey. The architecture, design , fittings and ambience of the hotel is truly great. We also loved the service at the club lounge and enjoyed drinks and delicious snacks through day. The views over Marina Bay and surrounds are incredible and we all felt relaxed and pampered during our stay.",5,October 2018,

Weekend in Singapore - all was good until.....,mrandmrdgr,"I was in Singapore to attend an event and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore for the weekend with my partner.  The food and service at the Ritz-Carlton's Chinese and Japanese restaurants were fantastic and it's check-in staff were all very pleasant.  The hotel provided a luxurious experience, that is, until I attended the gala event at the Grand Ballroom. The food was horrible (read ""cold"" food and ""lukewarm"" coffee) and the servers were inexperienced, no one seemed to know what to do. We had to order room service after the gala.  To make things worse, the music was just too loud (sounded like a ""cheap nightclub""). What was worse was the 3 LED displays at the Ritz-Carlton Singapore's Grand Ballroom. The displays in the ballroom were of really poor quality. It is…",2,September 2018,
Best view,Mindy Ang,"Room was at level 32 facing MBS, hands down the best view of Singapore's city(compared to many of the other hotels situated at Marina). Nothing fancy but still classy and comfortable. Club food doesn't have much variety but tastes ok. Professional and friendly staffs. Iconic window by the bathtub. The only thing missing will be.. a new in-room speaker! Love the lobby scent too, brought me back to the time I stayed at Ritz London hahaha",5,September 2018,
Exceptional lunch,Fishernan50,"The Colony at Ritz-Carlton Singapore is the venue for an exceptional Champagne lunch. The buffet style lunch provides an amazing array of choices including seafood, roasts (beef, duck etc), sushi and sashimi, Indian specialties, Chinese specialties, the longest cheeseboard, delightful and extensive desserts and sweet treats, unlimited wine or cocktails, or what I prefer, unlimited Vintage Moet Chandon. Heaven in an afternoon. This is a special way to spend an afternoon. The staff fantastic and can’t do enough for you. ",5,September 2018,
"Fantastic and adequate luxe hotel, rooms and service",The Sustainable Traveller,"Exactly what you would expect from Ritz Carlton, amplified in this hotel and location.

Big bath and shower were great.",5,May 2018,
Can I give it ten stars?,Travelhippie33,We stayed for two short nights recently and I have to say that I can not tell you enough how wonderful this hotel truly is.  It is not just the iconic location with by far the best view in Singapore but the people from the top down who make this hotel what it is. Nothing is too much trouble.  The food is just outstanding. The Chinese Michelin star restaurant was the best ever. My tip - upgrade to the executive club. French champagne all day. Food. It pretty much makes it an all inclusive hotel.  The breakfast buffet was ridiculous. Excellent price too.  The staff outstanding from the door to every outlet. The bed super comfortable with an amazing view.  I will never stay anywhere else in Singapore.,5,September 2018,
Fantastic stay!,amaaten10,"I checked in here just before the formula 1 race. I arrived early morning and was really happy they gave me an early check in with an upgrade with a nice view. We got a big room with a really Nice bathroom. What I really like is how friendly all employees are. The dinner buffet in the Colony is highly recommended. It was pity the swimming pool was closed for one day because a private F1 party. But to see the Ferrari party from above really made up for it. It was awesome to see the Ferrari car parked above the closed glass swimming pool. The taxi price was a bit high because the F1, but that was to be expected. Thanks to the Ritz for a very luxurious stay!",5,September 2018,
Magnificent Hotel with Fantastic longe Views,Saleh,"The hotel is located at Singapire Marina area where you can have access to plenty to near by luxury shopping malls. Also, you can reach to many of Singapore's top attractions such Singapore's Flayer, Gardens by the bay and Marina bay sands on foot. Also, the hotel provide free shutle to these places.  I have staied in club room where it was huge in size with comfortable bed and seating area. The bathroom was equipped with shower area and seperate bathtub with marvelous view.  It is highly recommended to have access to the club lounge on 32nd floor where you can have the breakfast on the morining and enjoy the view during the night.",5,September 2018,

The Place!!!,Juile H,"At the moment my husband and I are spending one week staying at the Ritz Carlton to holiday, shop and see the F1's. This is our third time staying at the RC and the service never changes 10/10. This is why we always return! The rooms have amazing views of Singapore and are huge in size with everything you want and need. The view from the bath is amazing!!  The Colony Restaurant has the best selection we have seen in a buffet and we have stayed in many hotels around the world. The hotel has been busy due to the F1's but plenty of staff to assist every want and need. So many shops near the hotel to keep you occupied. A nice place to relax is The Chihuly Lounge.

First Class Hotel,Pearlgirl01,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Hotel early September during our first visit to Singapore to celebrate a birthday.  From the moment we stepped out of the car on arrival the staff and particularly Seah, made us feel special and this continued throughout our whole stay.  The hotel is well located with our room having wonderful views of Marina Bay.  What a sight when the city lights up at night and the Gardens by the Bay put on their nightly display.  The food and service at the hotel is second to none.  The pool area is lovely and the hotel has an excellent gym.

This is also in an ideal location close to main restaurants, shopping and enables you to see the sights at a good walking distance. I look forward to returning here!",5,July 2018,
"Wonderful Hotel, even better staff!",bill983,"We live in Singapore so didn't stay in any of the rooms, so this review is in regard to The Colony restaurant at this property.  Without question this restaurant is staffed by the most professional, courteous and caring team I have ever had the pleasure to be with...!  The food is among the best (especially the herbal black chicken soup (MAGNIFICENT!) and ANYthing from the bakery...!

Exceeds expectations every time!,Amazing Grass,"My husband and I visited last year and were so pleased by our experience that we decided to return this year. Once again, the service was impeccable and elegant. Everyone, starting from Naoki and Evan at check-in/out were capable and efficient, with just the right amount of attentiveness that doesn't make one feel uncomfortable. We would also like to thank Murphy and Amanda for the unexpected hospitality that affirmed our decision to always return to Ritz Carlton at this time of the year. And also Ganesh, for that amazing attention to detail at turndown (our slippers, alarm clock, TV remote and light switches etc were all thoughtfully repositioned).  P.S.

From the fantastic location right smack opposite Marina Bay and near shopping malls like Marine Square, Suntec, City Link, Millenia Walk, Marina Bay Sands and Raffles City... to the awesome view of the bay, Marina Bay Sands, Flyer, Garden by the Bay, etc.  The staffs were so friendly and makes you feel right at home immediately. Breakfast is nothing short of phenomenal, the variety was so amazing that I didn't get to try everything. Facilities like the gym and swimming pool was clean and big.

"Faultless Service, Forward thinkers nothing is too hard.",MrCabinCrew,What can I Say! This hotel is just amazing. We arrived early (7am) knowing we would not be able to check in to our Club Room. The hotel was fully booked the prior night however the staff had arranged to look after our bags and offered us to have a light breakfast in the lounge. The view is just amazing and the food outstanding. Service is attentive without being intrusive. After breakfast we took the complimentary club car to the casino for a look. Once back we were checked into our roof swiftly. The view from the room was fantastic! We had a 5am flight so as we left at 3:30am I thought I’d try my luck with the breakfast. They said it didn’t open till 6am however they sent tea coffee and pastries to the room without charge! The pool staff were amazing also!,5,September 2018,
Pleasant stay,Burrr888,One of the best I have tried in Singapore. Clean and big rooms. My favourite part is the bathroom. I never want to leave my room.

Great place,Ashish S,"It's a great place to stay given the grand rooms and yes the grand bathrooms as well. Many of the bath tubs in the rooms oversee the Singapore marina which makes you feel royal if I may say. For Indians, you get masala tea and a few Indian breakfast items as well.   The only challenge is that if you are arriving by an early morning flight in SG, they won't let you do an early check in which is a challenge. ",5,February 2018,

View at its best,Anil T,"Stayed in the Ritz Carlton for a night and took the room facing the Marina Reservoir. The view was simply awesome. The room was v big and the bathroom was simply out of this world. The bathroom is designed such that when relaxing in the bathtub, you can enjoy the view of the Reservoir.

Wonderful hotel,David B,Recently stayed there with my family for 6 nights and had a great time. I have stayed in all the hotels around Marina Square now and would definitely consider the Ritz to be the best. The service is fantastic and the staff are very helpful and friendly.

Lacking in room amenities,Jess,"I switched to the Ritz Carlton last minute. I just discovered that the regular room does not have a coffee maker and only instant coffee is available in room. Room service is an option, but a lot of people don’t want to deal with that for a cup of coffee/espresso in the morning. For the price you pay for the hotel, I would think that every room would have a coffee maker. The other five star hotels I have stayed at in Singapore have some type of coffee maker in every room.",1,August 2018,

On the first occasion we meet Sandrine Qu a real credit to this wonderful hotel, she went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and special, unfortunately she was on holiday when we returned at the end of our trip, but she again surprised us by leaving a personal note in our room when we arrived.  If you can afford it opt for club access it’s a great experience with fantastic service, especially from a very special young man Ben, he is an absolute star, I’m from the hospitality trade and believe me he will go far.

Excellent hotel‼️,minichocolate,"My family and I stayed at this hotel during a brief visit to Singapore. I have nothing but good things to say about the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore - the entire hotel staff, including the Japanese desk staff, were friendly, always willing to help in any way they could, we had a room on the 30th floor with a beautiful view which was spotlessly cleaned everyday, and their breakfast was excellent‼️We at first considered staying at another renowned hotel in the area, but changed our minds and decided on the Ritz-Carlton and I'm really glad we did.

My check-in was delayed by a mere 30 minutes as the housekeeping team was still making it up by then. To be frank, I don't have any issue with that as there are malls nearby for me to spend some time while waiting.

One of the best in Singapore,RMJK,"I recently stayed at the Ritz for 3 nights during a business Visit.  It's not difficult to see why the hotel is so highly rated. The location is near perfect close to Raffles and the Sands, with plenty of malls and eating options around. The rooms are massive to say the least. The long floor size windows give a great view of the city. The rooms are well appointed with all modern amenities. The bathrooms are equally large with a tub that has amazing city views. The breakfast layout was very impressive, serving everyone's taste. It was never difficult finding a taxi from the hotel and the staff were very courteous and professional.

Very average for a Ritz,AWTata,"Rather disappointed with my first stay at this hotel... I chose this hotel without doing any research as I have heard a number of good comments from colleagues and friends. So when I knew I was going to Singapore for business, without a doubt, I booked this hotel. I was assigned to a room on the 4th floor, right above the restaurants. I had a good view of Marina Bay and the room was spacious. But that’s the end of the good stuff.  About the not-so-satisfied experience:  First, in the wardrobe area, there was a small door in the wall (half the size of a normal door). When I opened it (out of curiosity), there was another door which was unlocked and inside there were a few pipes, and I heard the sound of winds. It sounded and looked creepy so I closed it.

Perfect hotel,Jonathan D,Stayed here as part of our honeymoon. No non smoking rooms for the room type we booked were left so we got upgraded and had a stunning view. Breakfast was great.

From our check in with Laura at the front desk, who sent us a touching note and bottle of champagne to your room for our anniversary, to Diana (and one other girl, I didn’t catch her name) who we met in the lobby, also wrote us a note with must visit places to eat, and recommendations on what to order, the staff and accommodations at this location were exceptional.

We used car service for arrival, warmly greeted by the hotel representative at the airport, quick arrival of the car and lovely gentleman that drove us to the hotel. Warmly greeted on arrival at hotel, escorted to our room for check-in. Everything worked like a well oiled machine. Service on the club floor was superb, special mention to Cora, who was an absolute delight. Also, we had wonderful service from both Sheila and Ben.

Luxury at its finest with an amazing view of the Marina Bay.,Ching Liang C,"The registration was a pleasure. We were served by Raphael was professional, friendly and extremely helpful. Waited awhile for the room but the area was packed with eateries and shopping so that wasn't that much of a problem. The room was awesome. We upgraded to a suite and the high-floors plus the views was amazing. If you happened to be there during the National Day Parade or one of its previews, you will get a bonus treat because the bay view rooms over-looks the floating platform where the parade takes place.",5,July 2018,
That Sunday Champagne Brunch tho...,EastBayViking,"We visited the Ritz-Carlton, Millenia for their famed Sunday Champagne brunch at The Colony restaurant and wow! Certainly worth the splurge, your champagne glass will not go unfilled until you leave the restaurant.  It is a buffet of excess, from lobster to proper roast station, you'll eat to your heart's content while drinking some lovely Moët-Chandon vintage champagne.  Service was top-notch (we even asked to keep one of the champagne corks as memorabilia).  I'd suggest making a reservation at least one week in advance as it was quite crowded and most visitors will stay the full three hours the brunch is offered.",5,July 2018,
The best...,simonkaka,Fantastic service from the very first moment.  Every member of staff that I met from Reception to Bell Staff to Room Service to Restaurant where all magnificent.

Wonderful staff,Suzana,"I’ve been traveling the world and many times I’m lazy to write a review, but this time I had to. I never experienced such a lovely staff from the moment Hamesh opened the door of our cab to checkout. Hamesh took us on a short tour upon our arrival and made our 24 hour flight feel like nothing when he walked us into our room and assisted the way like we had our own personal guide. Thank you Hamesh and the gent that I can’t remember the name :( To add some more, we had a drink in Lobby lounge every night since the first night we were welcomed by Viet and we were so tired that we just wanted to grab a tea and go to bed. He made us feel like home and showed genuine care for us being so tired. We had such a sweet conversation with him and came back following night to see him again.…",5,July 2018,
A class above,Doreen L,"The Ritz Carlton stands a head above all other hotels in Singapore. The warmth exuded by the hotel staff is simply undeniable from the minute we entered the hotel, all the way to the reception desk n the rooms. They were very attentive n the service they provided made us feel like we were home away from home. The rooms are spacious n u can practically roll from east to west on the king size bed!  The full supply of amenities n toiletries in the rooms truly offers u the comfort of home.  Our hunger was nursed at The Colony where a sumptuous buffet of delectable spread was sufficient to feed an army! Coupled with a free flow of champagne n wine in the package, we lived like kings sinking our teeth into succulent meats n seafood as well as local delights!  Temptation was so great…",4,July 2018,
Special stay,tuchi1217,"We stayed for the first few nights of our honeymoon and it was an incredible stay! The staff were all so friendly and welcoming every opportunity they had they went out of their way to help us. During check in we were upgraded to a Marina bay room for our honeymoon which was so kind of them. The room was amazing and the view was just incredible! They also gave us a card and some small cakes to say congratulations and after returning from our day out they had gave us another honeymoon card and a bottle of Champagne, we were made to feel so special which made us feel so happy. From beginning to end of our stay it was just all in all outstanding, I couldn’t fault a one thing! We can’t recommend the Ritz Carlton Millenia more, thank you!",5,July 2018,
Classic 5 star hotel with amazing buffet at the Colony,Ozemail,"Recent quick stay at the Ritz-Carlton for a night in Singapore. Everything at the hotel was within what I would expect of a 5 star hotel like the Ritz. The accomodation and location and service were all first rate. We stayed in a water view room which was very large and comfortable with beautiful bathroom. Views of the water and Marina Sands were pretty spectacular.  Where the hotel rose above high expectations was the Colony restaurant which was amazing.  The atmosphere and service and selection of food was pretty outstanding so my highlight at this hotel was this restaurant both for breakfast and dinner.  Dinner was particularly amazing.   We chose a drinks ""package"" which I had never seen before which included wine and beer and water for a set price.  It was good value and…",4,July 2018,
Excellent Stay for business and couple,ninku30,"1. The location was closed to the Metro transportation which took around 5 minutes walking 2. The room was huge with a great view. There're sofa and desk. The AC plug was universal. The bathroom is quite big and clean and fully equipped by accessaries.  3. The service was excellent with a bunch of staffs is ready to assist when needed. 4. The fitness and swimming pool was excellent with the new equipment and the clean big pool. What I like the best is the room design, equipment and technologies that provided in the room increase my stay appreciation to the next level.",5,September 2017,
Excellent,Ian F,The best hotel I have ever stayed in. Overlooking the floating stage with views of the Marina Sands hotel and the gardens from the bathroom and main room.

Would recommend this hotel for a treat.,5,June 2018,
Wow.  Just wow.,TheBulldog!,"This hotel is classy, comfortable and immaculately clean.  The location is ideal, in the Marina Bay Area.   The breakfast, pool and gym are top-notch.

The entire family loved this hotel, and we can’t wait to return!",5,July 2018,
Birthday Celebrations,Sandy M,Fantastic hotel in the perfect location to appreciate all that Singapore has to offer. The staff excel in their roles to provide the utmost satisfaction.

Excellence When it Really Counts,Lee N,"On our recent visit to Singapore staying at the Ritz Carlton my wife had a medical emergency. While putting on her make up, she was suddenly inflicted with acute, intense pain in the middle of her chest which was incapacitating. She had never had anything like this before. I’m a doctor and, even though she is only 45 years old, this could very well be a heart attack. I called Hotel Security and told them we needed an ambulance which they called immediately, then came to our room equipped with oxygen and a defibrillator in case it was necessary which they had been trained to use. The Assistant Front Desk Manager, Evan Chiang, was also there as was a woman from his staff to supervise her rapid removal from room to ambulance.  It turns out that the cause of the pain was gastric…",5,July 2018,

I would like to thank Sheila the Manager from the Business Lounge & Lavin the Guest Relations for making our stay perfect, they both always were there for us when we needed it and they were above and beyond our expectations.   The business lounge is excellent, as they offer a great breakfast in a private and secluded area with great views and drinks, which are great after a sightseeing.

Service was exemplary, as we were immediately shown to our room, and checked-in there. Ammenities awaited, and to our surprise, the fruit and chocolates were replenished during our visit. The room was exceedingly comfortable— spacious and well-appointed, with excellent lighting. The environment was conducive for work as well as relaxation. Public areas of the hotel are positively stunning, with significant sculpture by Dale Chihuly and Frank Stella. The pool area was magnificent.

My first night, I had the buffet dinner at Colony, and it was truly the best buffet I have ever had in my entire life - the selection seems to be endless.

Strategic Location for Family Vacation,Rasjid R,"Ritz-Carlton Millenia located not far from Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade and Suntec City Mall. Therefore, if you want to bring your family to Singapore, Ritz-Carlton Millenia is an option to stay in a five star hotel.  The room was spacious, the view from the room was breathtaking, the food was delicious and the pool is child friendly. The staff are very helpful and nice. Ask for Ritz Kids package if you have children under 8 years old.  If you want to explore Singapore, do not forget to visit a Hawker Center (street food) near the hotel called Makansutra Gluttons Bay. The have good chilli crab (you can ask for not spicy) and chicken wings. They also have other food as well.  You can also go to Suntec City Mall (not far from the hotel) and take the Duck Tour.

Best Luxury hotel truly!,GSK_Pharma,This hotel is always my first choice for staycation due to the strategic city location.  The hotel room has all the facilities you can think of for both leisure and business purposes.  Shopping areas are located within proximity and the food wise is definitely something worth speaking about.  The restaurant offers very good buffet and hi-tea.  The spread is definitely one of the largest and most comprehensive ever seen in all the hotels stayed.  The service staff are very accommodating and obliging in every way possible to make your stay a very memorable one! Kudos!  Will be my first choice hotel stay always! See you soon!!!,5,July 2018,

"Amazing Hotel, Excellent Staff and Wonderful Service",jamessW8845DN,"This was my first time staying at this hotel.  While I am a Gold member of Marriott/Ritz Carlton Rewards, the hotel does not participate in the program.  So no status recognition.  However, they treated me very well. My room was very modern and clean.  A/C worked very well.  There was a nice gift waiting for me upon my arrival and the room service and bar were great.  Hotel staff smiled and everything that I requested was delivered very quickly with no issues.  I generally stay at the Grand Hyatt in Singapore, but this will be my new hotel of choice.  Status or no status, when a hotel has great leadership and strives to exceed every guest's expectations - that is the very definition of service.  Very well done.",5,July 2018,

A home away from home,gp9802,"Besides of the convenient location, the great view to the bay, and the luxurious facility, I'd say the most beautiful view of Ritz-Carlton Millenia is their great staffs and their hospitality to the guests. My family truly felt Ritz-Carlton Millenia was a home away from home during our stay. Everyone was so nice and the conversations with your staff, wherever in the lobby, the restaurant, or the swimming pool, were not just saying hello/good day. We can feel they did care about you, your experience with the hotel, and even more your impression on Singapore.",5,July 2018,
Family visit,LinandMike R,"We flew into Singapore to visit family and friends in Singapore and Johor Bahru, but always treat ourselves to a couple of nights at the Ritz before we fly back home.  Pros : We regularly stay at the Ritz, and this certainly lived up to our expectations. Customary impeccable Ritz service, which truly makes the stay all the more pleasant. Great restaurants, a short walk to Marina Bay Sands and the shops, and even closer to Millenia Walk and the Singapore Flyer.  Cons : Couldn't think of any! But wish they would take Marriott points",5,October 2017,

I could watch city lights from the bathtub as well .Breakfast is a little confusing with so many sections to choose from but fun to explore. The room was clean, the service is good too. When I ask for something, they make sure that it is taken care of. I have never stayed at a hotel with such good service. Usually people tend to forget and mishaps occur at least once during a 5 day stay.  But for this hotel, everything was taken care of. Even when my colleague left something at the front desk for me to pick up, they called my room and made sure I received it.",5,June 2018,
Awesome Stay 👍,attyloveceti,"Check in process wasn't that smooth but its due to weekends and high demands so its okay. Front desks officers were super helpful.   The room was facing to Marina Bay.

Great experience overall with attentive staff!,Juniormich,"My husband and my 5month old baby booked the RC for my birthday staycation. The hotel was very accommodating of my requests for infant amenities such as baby tub and bottle steriliser, and reassured me that the items will be available for my stay.  Before reaching the front counter with my many bags and stroller,the staff approached me and asked if she could offer assistance and immediately informed the bellboy to assist with my baggage. At the check in counter, Mr Zong was very attentive to notice my birthday was just around the corner and offered an upgrade to a room with better view.

A pleasant stay as always,L.C,"Always loved the ritz. My favorite bathtub. I love the location, the hotel, the view, the restaurants but not so much the in-room dining.   Housekeeping is great - they turn down your room, topped up the bath salts and made sure everything was comfortably. And they provide financial times.   View- amazing. Worth paying for. Stayed at the Kallang view room this time- and it was just as good.   Service- can be improved. We had noisy guests running outside our room constantly yelling and this affected our sleep- which then resulted to us getting up late. And the constant calling from the front desk to wake us up to check out even though we stayed 3 nights was unbecoming. But definitely can be improved.   In room dining- mediocre. Do not order butter chicken. Lousy.   Highly…",4,July 2018,

Excellent one night stay after long cruise,V S,"We reserved our room through Amex Platinum's hotel and resort program which offered us guaranteed late check out and a free breakfast and the possibility of early check in, a room upgrade and a taxi to the airport if available.  Since our ship arrived in Singapore a day before we were due to check in, we stopped by the hotel to make sure our reservation was all right and to inquire about early check in.  We were told that they would do everything they could if it was available. The next morning, we reluctantly left our cruise ship and took a taxi to the hotel.  Upon arrival, we were escorted to the Club Level for check in, offered breakfast and told that we could check in immediately (around 10 am).

hotel with spectacular view and good service,TwinkleStar1818,"It's been sometime since we visit RItz Carlton and did a staycation to watch the national day rehearsal. This round, we got the Ritz KIds safari package that came with a tent in the room.  The boys were definitely wow by the tent in the hotel room once we stepped into the hotel room. We have stayed in so many hotels within the region but none offered a tent in the room, especially when the room size is spacious and having a tent in the room did not compromise the comfort that it provides in the room.  As the hotel is pretty old, some parts of the room would show its age, e.g. the wooden strip flooring seemed to come off quite a bit near the ledge.   The package comes with an evening turn down service. However, it was communicated to us during check-in.. and so when they…",5,June 2018,
Fantastic experience,mel30324,"If you are looking for a luxury hotel in Singapore, this is a great choice. Especially, if you are a westerner. The rooms are large and so were the bathrooms. As is Ritz Carlton staff, they are all wonderful, smiling and extremely accommodating. The front desk staff is impeccable! Especially Amirul!!!  He was the epitome of Ritz service.    Their rooms are very clean and tidy. The air conditioning works – which I can say is a plus - I stayed at another hotel nearby and their air conditioning was not as robust.  The breakfast in the main dining room is just magical. I was greeted by 1970s tunes which was kind of comical. King of the road was playing as I entered.

We were attended by Chun Wai, who had constantly provided top-notch services and genuine care. We were also thankful for Karen, Siat Yin and Helen as they constantly come around to check if we needed any assistance.  We really enjoyed the Peony Dinner Dinner Set, especially the double-broiled soup in coconut, it was the best soup we ever had!

We arrived about 30 mins before high tea starts and decided to have a drink at the hotel bar. We were a little hungry and wanted to order some finger food but it was not available till evening time - which is fine. To our surprise, our server Rudi, brought us a plate of mini sandwich to tie us over. How thoughtful of him.  Enroute to Colony restaurant, we decided to head to the toilet first. Perhaps it was the chablis that we had and we ended up somewhat lost.

Best Service & Location,Michael A,"Just an amazing time here at the Ritz in Singapore. The staff is first class from top to bottom, and made our family feel like we were their most important customer.   Food was great. Colony buffet is a must. Loved the 24-hour gym - with the cold towels after a solid workout. Pool was quiet and tranquil - actually feel asleep with the music.   Rooms are spacious, quiet and clean. Hotel is welcoming and in great shape. The entire staff is always willing to help  - or simply offer a smile. Ben, Daniel and Chuck in the concierge level are great. Made our trip a great one.   View of the Bay is great. No need to stay at the Sands when you can admire it from the Ritz. Close to all the things you want to see, do and eat in Singapore - and a short trip to the airport.

She knew that Ritz holds a special place in my heart, being part of this great place for 4 years (2008-2012) and I haven't been back there since quite a while.  As I entered, I was reminded by lots of fond memories though the faces that I saw along the way were no longer the familiar ones. It was my first time dining in Colony (after it revamped from Greenhouse). At the entrance, we were warmly greeted by Tessa, who found me familiar and even remembers my name (WOW!).

The bulk of the team offers 2* professionalism,Kristen,"I was a regular patron here, until the recent spate of events.  Unfortunately, good service comes only from a prick of the entire team; which leaves you to memorise the names of Colony’s Raj & Jenny, Chihuly’s Liz & Housekeeping’s Chee Mung.  Unlike many 5* establishments, their GM & EAM do not seem ubiquitous & are not available for direct contact. Therefore, the best way to provide feedback is through this medium.  Most of the team provides superficial niceties with no real deliverables nor intent to deliver at all in some cases. It is a shameful experience to have them leave voicemails with contents which cannot be deciphered, attached to a hunting line.... therefore, subjecting customers like myself to company politics & put on a wild goose chase. Preposterous.  2 of my…",2,June 2018,

A tat too busy but service is still commendable,weelinga,"We booked two rooms and asked for the rooms to be next to each other. However, the rooms that were originally set aside for us were unavailable as one of the guests had not checked out yet. The staff apologised and upgraded one of the rooms to marina view. The hotel is still generally very accommodating and hospitable. Rooms are well kept and housekeeping staff are friendly.  One of the wait staff at Colony was probably too new and kept hovering around our table to check if we needed plates to be cleared. He even cleared my glass when I wasn’t done with my drink.",4,June 2018,
Perfect,Patricia T,"We found this hotel to be excellent. The rooms are comfy and large, if you are fortunate enough to have a room overlooking Marina Bay the view is great. I would say the staff are the best we have encountered, friendly, helpful and nothing is too much. The hotel restaurants are good especially the Colony. From this hotel you are able to walk across the  footbridge to Marina Bay Sands Mall, hotel and casino. You can also do a loop walk around the bay where there are restaurants, cafes and bars on the Fullerton side. If you fancy a long walk once you cross the footbridge turn right and the gardens are there, great for walking and even cycling.

Always treated like a VIP here,chrismenon,"I would never choose another hotel in Singapore for celebrating special occasions. I have celebrated 5 birthdays, Christmases, and special events at this hotel, and am familiar with the staff. They always treat me/us with the best service possible. A special shoutout to Kent Ang, Chef Joeson Tiong, Bernard and Hui Peng. Chef Joeson personally came to speak to us during the meal and insisted that dessert is on the house. And Kent picked up on something we mentioned about the art in the hotel, and the following week he mailed to my home an envelope with a letter and a collection of Ritz Carlton bookmarks each with a special artpiece printed on it. Ritz always gets top marks for guest recognition and service. Look forward to another stay there this July.",5,April 2018,
Awesome customer service!,Yeo W,"Had a dinner on the 27 May with my wife in Colony.

A rare relaxing moment,Emem2,"Invited by friends to celebrate a special occasion. Expensive high teas are not on my agenda. I would recommend this for a special occasion, because it was memorable. And way better than others I've been to. The service was excellent. The courses were superbly plated with explanations. And the tea had an excellent variety of bites, not overloaded with just the sweet stuff. Take some advice when choosing your tea. Mine became a tad bitter and I wasn't sure I could change it. The others all loved their choices. A truly lovely treat. ",5,June 2018,

Great hotel,Alexey Ivanov,Decided to stay here for my first visit to Singapore. I really happy with my decision. Nice hotel with easy access to other places and they serve great breakfast too.

Thoroughly Enjoyable Staycation!!,yogeshv865,Our family had a very enjoyable staycation over our daughter's sixth birthday. It was our first ever staycation and we didn't know how it would go. We choose the Ritz Kids Night Safari and a marina bay view room. All of us especially our daughter really relished the camping experience. The staff were courteous and helpful throughout our stay. Special mention to Nivedha (sorry if we got your spelling wrong) for taking special care of us.  Of course the bill at the end of this wonderful experience wasn't for the faint hearted...   The breakfast was completely off the charts!! Cant wait to go back..,5,May 2018,
Wow oMG wow!!,WendyinAscot,"Brunching in Singapore is an event that you almost need to train for! Everyone has their personal favourites sir various Reasons . Could be they serve their favourite champagne , could be the hours suit them better than others . But wherever you go it’s an experience not to be missed. On this trip I went to two. I had not brunches at the Ritz for several years and it was booked By some friends who love it . Well I wasn’t disappointed ! The display of seafood was nothing short of spectacular and every station was an artistic choice of Pretty Much everything you Could Possibly dream of . Many live stations with friendly chefs happy to explain the dish . Three hours of free flow champagne and this huge feast leaves you quite exhausted! In the best possible way ! It’s not a budget…",5,April 2018,
Simply the best!,egdels,"Once again my wife and I had a marvellous stay on Club Level, this time from 24th to 27th February  2018. Our daughter and her family have now been in Singapore for over four years and each time we visit them, we book three nights at the Ritz Carlton Millenia by way of a relaxing haven for us and a special treat for one of our three lovely little granddaughters. (They take it turns and this time Poppy joined us.)  In our opinion, the Ritz Carlton’s commanding view of Singapore is the best to be found (and that alone is inspiring), but in addition this hotel offers superb facilities throughout. The rooms, restaurants and pool area are particularly impressive and Club Level is outstanding for its relaxed atmosphere and friendly service. However, it is the staff who make this place…",5,February 2018,
Utterly fabulous!,natanntan,"I’m afraid this review is shockingly overdue- but better late than never. We have actually stayed at this hotel a couple of times (the first nearly 18 years ago when my husband proposed to me!) and more recently during Singapore’s 50th National Day Celebrations.  We had a club room with a view over the Singapore Marina area to take advantage of the view of the celebrations and the fireworks.  The room was amazing- the staff had gone above and beyond to create a magical and wonderful environment for our three children with little gifts and a bedding configuration reminiscent of the most exciting sleepover ever!  The club lounge access guaranteed no one was ever hungry- with delicious breakfasts and morsels for snacking throughout the day, all with impeccable service.  The pool…",5,,
Early Father's Day Celebrations,Patrick,"The Colony Restaurant at  The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore 7 Raffles Avenue, Singapore 039799, Singapore must deserve the highest ranking accolades as far as my family and myself are concerned. We had an awesome Father's Day Celebrations last Saturday, June 2, 2018 here and everything (and I mean everything) was simply perfect from the time we were shown to our table to the time we made our exit. The food and service we enjoyed is simply incomparable and I can honestly say there isn't any other hotel that comes even close to what I would rate as the only 6 star ****** one in Singapore. If (like us), you are looking for the most value-for-money experience for any buffet spread and service par excellence, you will never regret giving The Colony a visit. The piece de resistance…",5,June 2018,
What an epicurean journey!,Byrtimizer,"First of all, I am very surprised to the price of set menu dinner at Summer Pavilion. It was not pricey at all compared to its big name of the hotel brand as well as internationally-recognised validation of being one Michelin-starred dining venue. So I made decision to celebrate my partner’s birthday there.  From the ambience, dress code, and everything would easily make diners feel stiff and careful but not at all. You would feel at ease after your arrival. The service was impeccable through highest level of professionalism that you easily noticed, if you would, from how they communicated among them to ensure that every guest would never be missed to get an attention.    The quality (taste, presentation, portion size, etc.) are as great as you would expect out of its fame. But…",5,May 2018,

It went like clockwork.  Staff attentive, well-informed and helpful (and as the holiday progressed they remembered details of previous conversations, too). Credit in particular to Danial, Ben and Lenna.  A quick introduction to the hotel and Singapore in the Club Room from Melissa was a memorable experience. The view  and the complimentary champagne (as part of the Club Room package) after a long journey was  just the wind-down we needed.  The room was exactly as advertised.

Buffet lunch at the all day dining and cocktails at the lounge. 26/5/18,Talos T,"I had a free day and decided to pop down to the Ritz for some pampering.   Lunch at the all day dining was adequate. The food was acceptable. Service was top notch. From the moment I stepped in, I was taken care of. Guided to where I needed to be, recommendations where spot on. Staff was friendly.   Food wise;   Tuna sashimi had scales in them, which was disappointing as I did not expect that kind of error from a brand which is usually so detailed. On the other hand, it means the tuna was filleted and cut in-house so that's a quality plus point?  The staff answered my question ""I'm just looking for lunch, what would you recommend?"" with a ""We are famous for our buffet"" but frankly speaking, I've had better buffets. The food was good. Very good, but not famous for it good.   The…",5,May 2018,
Superb Club Level Experience,603lmv,"We recently stayed Club Level at the Ritz Carlton at the end of a month long holiday in South East Asia to celebrate a big birthday.  The service was world-class, absolutely outstanding.  The views of the Marina and City, as said before by previous reviewers, are arguably the best you can get, looking directly at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Gardens of the Bay, etc, etc.  We would specifically like to thank Sheila, the Club Manager and Ryan, Club Concierge, Chef Sundar and all the rest of the Club staff who looked after us.  They are unfailingly attentive and courteous, and the food and beverage offering of the Club is quite simply superb.

Also not forgetting the housekeeping team for their prompt service. Thanks to them, our son had such a fun time “camping” in our room.   Special mention and appreciation to Aisya from Reservations who liaised with my hubby via email prior to our stay to prepare for a “surprise” to be delivered to our room on Mother’s Day.

A great panoramic room view,Eman Shabani,"My visit to Singapore was too short. I spent few days there. I have searched for places I could visit in this short period of time before visiting Singapore. I found all I needed at the Ritz-Carlton, where I had a wonderful time, good food, wide room and a beautiful view of the bay. I enjoyed the great panoramic room view as it was my request. It has another amazing view by a hexagon window in the bathrooms. I have chosen the Ritz precisely because of its excellent location, which overlooks the bay and  Marina bay sand hotel which has a great shape, so that I can not miss the beauty of the wonderful view. I got the best treatment from all the staff. I enjoyed the stay ",5,May 2018,

A great property that lives up to it's reputation,Adesitraveller,"We decided to do a short staycation in Singapore and decided to stay at the Ritz Carlton since we'd heard so much about the rooms.  We booked a Grand Marina room as recommended by the reservation team for the best view.  The check-in process was smooth and swift. Local guests will also get a parking redemption ticket that is valid for just one entry though. The hotel is connected to a couple of malls by a walkway and for tourists, it is possible to go shopping, dine and have entertainment without once stepping on to the street.  The room was a pleasant surprise and the view of the Marina was superb.

Kudos to Laura who sorted out my executive lounge access confusion with Agoda. Yes, executive lounge access is a ""very good to have"" as it has a very good view of the marina bay front. Not withstanding its good spread of food. The room was pretty huge with fantastic view of marina bay front. Super big bathroom with a walk in wardrobe.

Upon check-in we were advised that our room was not available due to that specific request and that they can offer us a king sized room. The lady at the reception looked very confused and frustrated when we told her that we still insisted on having a double bed room, she bargained that if we will accept alcohol not to be removed then we can have the room ready within 30 minutes..

Informed me the concierge will send me a message via my phone once the room is ready.  2) Waited for 30mins, decided to have a walk at the mall nearby. At 3pm, still no contact from the hotel. I tried to be understanding even though my family is tired and my baby needed sleep. I waited even more, knowing that the hotel just hosted ASEAN Summit.

One of the best hotels I have stayed in.,Andrew W,"Fabulous, fantastic, everything was almost perfect - except for the toilet!!

I'm rather ""picky"" especially for a hotel of this standard.  Everything was fantastic until I went into the toilet - cheap toilet seat, cheap toilet paper, while ""on the throne"" I felt I was in a 1950's VW bus parked in the Ritz in Paris.

After having a nap in the afternoon, we went out for dinner and when we came back we were pleasantly surprised our room had been tidied and bed made up again. We went for the buffet breakfast which had a great selection of all different foods and in the evening they had live singers on which was a lovely setting to have a few nibbles and a glass of…",5,April 2018,
Wonderful Stay,Inks,"Nothing but a great experience- from opening the taxi door, service with our luggage, check in - no waiting time even though we arrived early- and our amazing corner suite- staff is very professional, friendly, courteous- all in all a perfect end to our cruise that ended in Singapore.",5,March 2018,
Easter Sunday Brunch,love2travel151,We had the most amazing brunch for Easter Sunday. The food and service was outstanding. An amazing selection to suit all tastes. Free flowing champagne with highly attentive staff meant glasses were never empty! The Easter theme was also amazing with beautiful handmade Easter eggs. Highly recommend,5,April 2018,
Putting on the Ritz Singapore Style,Lin S,"Just spent four days post cruise feeling very spoilt and special in a Club Millenium Suite having been generously upgraded from a Premier Club Suite to celebrate our 54th Wedding Anniversary. We can't speak too highly of the service and friendly attention that we received and from what we saw this is the norm, though we did get some extra treats because of the occasion. Very much appreciated. The hotel overlooks Marina Bay with its' constant pageant of activity and beyond into the ocean approaches. The Mer Lion and the Gardens by the Bay are within about 15 minutes walking distance and the MRT similarly accessible via the adjacent Mall. Taxis seem plentiful and not expensive. Besides the Club and its' great culinary presentations throughout the day, the hotel has a large…",5,March 2018,
Singapore’s Sensational Champagne Lunch,GB227,Colony is without a doubt Singapore’s best Champagne Sunday lunch. The variety and quality of what is offered to you is fantastic and the free flowing vintage Moët is pure nectar.   This was our second visit which was made all the more memorable to see Lewis again.,5,March 2018,
Perfection exists!,Liudmyla555,When you stay in the Ritz-Carlton you expect to be treated royally. But this hotel exceeded all of our expectations! Superb service and unbelievable attention! We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else next time! If perfection exists it is right here!,5,March 2018,
Amazing!,maria e,Everything was absolutely perfect! All the staff were extremely polite and helpful! The hotel areas and room were very cleaned. The food (breakfast and dinner) were delicious.  They offered us a room upgrade since it was our honeymoon!  Just a minor recommendation: it should be more convenient for us to ammend the opening hours of the michellen star-restaurant. 9.45 for the last order is a bit early for some european countries.,5,March 2018,
Very nice.....But,devildog36,"So we are platinum with Marriott and we were excited when the Ritz family joined together with Marriott.  We got our chance this week and decided to stay at the Ritz in Singapore.  Let me begin by saying it is everything you expect from a Ritz property.  The service is exemplary,  the food is wonderful, the drink fantastic and the art work and decor is breathtaking.  With that said you may notice we only gave four stars.   They did honor our platinum status and upgraded our room but we do not get access to the executive lounge and breakfast was not included.  Neither is a massive deal and, to be fair, their idea of a executive lounge is very different from the Marriott version.  For access it is over $200 SG for one day.  But, when you are expecting these things it’s a surprise…",4,March 2018,
Amazing as always,Paradise409807,"Just finished a three day stay in a club room. We had a quite room on the 32 floor near the club lounge,the bed was very comfortable and we were greeted with a lovely fruit plate as well as flowers in the bathroom, which has a great shower and lovely bath. The lounge is great we had breakfast,afternoon tea and cocktails during our stay. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly, organised a room for us to shower on our last day as we had a evening flight they also arranged access to club lounge until we left for the airport. This was our second stay at the Ritz but it won’t be our last. A special thanks to the amazing staff at the club lounge.",5,March 2018,
What a great hotel,Darny123,From the moment you arrive until the minute you leave you are made to feel special because the staff are so attentive but not in an 'in your face' way.  Rooms are large and very comfortable.  Location is stunning especially if you get a marina facing room.  Food is excellent catering for a very wide range of tastes.  The special drinks package is exceptionally good value for money.  Well done everyone at the Ritz-Carlton,5,February 2018,
Unforgettable experience,Reviewingyoufairly,"This is a very overdue review, for what was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. I booked this as as a birthday surprise last May and to propose! The lead up to coming was very good and I was really impressed with Carolyn and Tracy from the Guest Recognition team who went above and beyond, understanding how important this stay was for us and delivering. Their help and communication in the lead up to our stay was great and the effort they and the rest of the team put in to making our room look as it did was phenomenal.   All the team that we interacted with were excellent. The team in the club lounge, Chuck, Dianna and Hamizan were so friendly and kind and we loved talking to them. Also the chefs in the lounge, Yun and his eggs were excellent! And Karthi, was lovely…",5,April 2017,
Old but good,TY_Wong,"Large room with a nice view. Things are quite well maintained. The swimming pool is nothing to shout about.   The Ritz kids (so called kids club) is a converted  hotel room that don't really have any activities for kids. No scheduled kids activities, small, no person in charge to take care of the kids.   Room is a bit old but overall is good, large (for Singapore standard). The mattress is a bit old and sunk down. House keeping didn't really do good job, there are a lot of small chocolates (given during the turn down service)  dropped into the bed frame in between the mattress and be a frame.  There are turn down service which is good.   The worse part is the hot water supply. It doesn't has a proper continuous heated water supply during shower.   Location is good for marina bay…",4,March 2018,
Superb,David S,"We stayed in a Marina view Club room which has gorgeous views as the name suggests. For a special occasion we treated ourselves to the Club room with the associated privileges. This is not cheap but still offers value for money. On arrival the extremely efficient lady who greeted us from the taxi had identified us from our luggage labels and sped us to the Club lounge on the top floor. Check was done here in a relaxed setting with a drink. We arrived at 10am but our room was ready early which was a real plus. The service in the lounge is excellent, friendly and efficient.Ryan did a sterling job. The food options in the lounge change through the day and are considerable. The cocktail hours are lovely as you can watch the twice per evening light shows at the marina and Gardens by…",5,March 2018,
A great business hotel,Jacf05,"The level of personalised service in such a large hotel was very impressive.  Check in was speedy but flawless, my bags arrived shortly after I did!  I was in the basic room but it was enormous, with proper sofa and arm chairs, a huge desk with power for pretty much every variation of a standard plug.  The Nespresso machine was appreciated too!  The Bathroom was very impressive with nice toiletries that included a comb, toothbrush and loofa - all the little things you can't live without if you forget them!  The pool was also beautiful, which I wasn't expecting in such a business orientated location",5,March 2018,
Another great experience!,-eatyouthenyouknow2-,"The Ritz always delivers, and we have always enjoyed our stay! This time around, it was better than we remembered!   The staff were super helpful, attentive and just some of the best we have ever come across. We actually booked our stay a month ago but due to some family emergencies, we had to cancel. Candice and Li Xian from Weddings were so understanding and allowed us our stay back here despite the situation, and we cannot be more thankful for their help and understanding.  Renato (Hotel Manager) also went above and beyond to grant us our request for late check out as we were celebrating our delayed wedding anniversary.  Lastly, Sheila, Firdaus & Michelle at the Club really made our stay the nicest, most enjoyable experience. Always so jolly, with a smile on their faces with…",5,March 2018,
Pass on this one and book the JW,Mitch R,"Mitch and the team racked up a couple nights at the Ritz, and aren’t heading back again. First of all, the lobby bar service was slow and the language barrier was unexplainable. Anywhere you go in Singapore the primary language is English. Not so much for the staff at the Ritz. If you aren’t speaking Chinese you better get ready to do sign language. Maybe it was just an off shift, but to order a drink was a major chore. Also, the service was intolerably slow. Room was average at best especially since they don’t upgrade anyone with Marriott. That’s right. This is one of three Ritz’s in the world that doesn’t participate in the Marriott program. The disclaimer is in small print on the Marriott website.   This is my 10th trip to Singapore and I made the mistake to not stay at the…",3,March 2018,
Great hotel in Singapore,Antony M,"It is certain that this is not a cheap hotel at ALL.  However the rooms are amazing - large and comfortable. The staff could not be more responsive and attentative.  The location is a bit isolated but if you are staying here why would you go out.  Certainly recommend this Hotel - just note it is XXX'y and so is room service, the mini bar and breakfast.",5,March 2018,
Best hotel if you love an Indian food,Hemamalini S,"The breakfast is very big with many menus. I loved the Indian food at the restaurant. Service is good. Suga, the Indian chef is very friendly.

Wonderful stay and amazing staff,Aretusa75,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel in March 2018. It was a business trip. I was booked into a standard room which was amazing. I am fussy about things like the smell of the bed linen, the toiletry in the bathroom and the quality of towels. Everything was excellent. The room was large and the air con very good and easy to manage (I hate air con). The staff was just so extremely kind and attentive. I would like to praise two individuals in particular: Mr Dickson Soon and Ms Serene Lo. Dickson was like a member of family - he treated me like royalty, remembered my name and always offered a smile and a helping hand. He went above and beyond his call of duty and I could tell he was genuine. Serene was also such a sweatheart. She gifted me a little toy for my daughter. They but also all…",5,March 2018,
Awesome!!,SeahKC,"After staying in so many different places, I can safely say Ritz is the jewel of the crown among the hotels in SG. From the reception where my family was warmly welcomed by Douglas, to the pool staff and restaurant staff. No details were left unturned. When they found out it's my younger child's birthday, they threw in a surprise that got her gushing with happiness. Not to mentioned a personalized card with all the birthday greeting from all the front desk staff. It's really remarkable how much effort they put to make us feel special. No doubt it's expensive, but I can vouch it's going to be worth every single dime.  Oh yes I forgot to mention, the view here... took my breathe away, even though I have just got back from intercontinental in HK where their harbor view is one of…",5,March 2018,

Staff were lovely and eager to help. The hotel facilities are very good and the room was lovely. The view from the room was the standout, absolutely breathtaking, you don't even need to get on the Singapore Flyer next door. Breakfast is fantastic in the lounge with great service.",5,May 2017,
Anniversary celebration,davidngka,We decided to celebrate our Anniversary at Ritz Carlton. The ladies and gentlemen of Club Lounge overheard we were celebrating and instantly took a picture of us and to our surprise by the time we return to the room the pictures were ready printed and displayed on our table with nice wishes. The ladies and gentlemen at Ritz never failed to impress and that’s why it is my favorite hotel. In two weeks time will be spending some quality time with family at Ritz Carlton Bali and Mandapa Reserve. Looking forward. Thank you again to the Club Team at Ritz Carlton for making our stay memorable.,5,March 2018,
THE place to stay in Singapore,Mary H,"Let me start by saying that the rooms in the RC have spectacular views of Singapore. This is our third stay in the hotel and we had a corner rooms with breathtaking views of the city, MBS and Singapore Flyer.  We enjoyed superb service at the club level again by Catherine, Cora and the team there.  We ate in the Colony restaurant on 2 nights.  Excellent.  We usually don't choose buffet style dining but this was exceptional with 8 (I think) live food stations - everything from Oysters to Roast beef to Tandoori oven to Chinese.  The restaurant was well organised with lots of staff and the quality of food was superb - well done to the Manager.  The pool is great - surrounded by greenery and quiet, again with very attentive staff.  If you want a few days away in a luxurious hotel in…",5,March 2018,

We had booked our pick up and drop off from and to the airport through the service offered by the hotel. Anh Chu, the guest service representative, was there to greet us and she made our stay that much more memorable! She was knowledgeable, friendly and professional in her service. We couldn't have asked for a better person to look after us. She took us to our room, showed us around and made sure that we would be comfortable settling in. Even though we had stayed at the hotel before, Anh made us feel as if we were the most important guests of…",5,February 2018,

The recognition didn't stop until well after we were leaving.  We were upgraded to a corner suite with a brilliant view of the city and more impressively the Marina Bay, just because they really wanted to knock our socks off and boy wow did they knock our socks off.  I think everyone in the club room area was treated equally which really is one of the most rewarding experiences, everyone there was there to just soak up the atmosphere, delight in the ambiance and relax knowing the staff were their to make our day special, and they did, in so many ways.

Inconsistency service standards need urgent attention,glnomad,"One steps into an establishment such as Ritz Carlton expecting all-round excellence. Visitors would probably need to tone their expectations down in this Singapore outfit.  The rooms are fully functional, well maintained and the entire hotel appears modern. What is disappointing is the software - some service staff are arrogant, unfriendly and aloof. This is especially if one is non Westerner or Japanese especially since the latter group seems to be a strong clientele of this establishment. We had a very unpleasant experience during check-in: the young gentlemen at reception was rude , no pleasantries and an attitude such as ""What do you want"". This we observed was an attitude replicate by some of his colleagues. Due to Tripadvisor review rules, we shall not reveal the name.…",3,March 2018,

Impressed !,zanne66,"Did a bit of hotel hopping in 5-stars hotels in SG during a recent trip and I must say Ritz Carlton wins hands down.

The pleasant surprise is that this service in consistently displayed to the backdoors of the spa, pool , gift shop and restaurant.   I stayed at the Marina view and it's absolutely stunning and I will recommend it!   The only disappointment is the housekeeping - details of the previous guest informations were left in the hotel brochures in the room and i did spot some dust at the edge of the bed. I missed the spa specials in the hotel brochures and I think it's time for Ritz-Carton to move to electronic hotel brochures (most luxury hotels have ipads now)   The hotel had great…",5,January 2018,

Fantastic V-day Dinner with special shout-out to Alice Choo,slim888385,"I had a wonderful V-day dinner experience at the Colony. It is my third time dining there and the staff are polite as usual, ambience romantic as always. The dinner package which had included a Terrarium-making activity and photo booth were quite unusual and had pleasantly surprised me.   There was a minor hiccup when the hotel paper bag that contained my Terrarium gave way and the pebbles were spilled onto the floor on our way home. Desperate to get a replacement of the pebbles, I reached out to the hotel via their general email. Ms Alice Choo responded back to me very quickly and offered to send the pebbles to my residence on CNY eve!

He is very helpful and excellent in service.  I have a chance to have an afternoon tea at Chihuly Lounge again and George is doing is job as always. I feel like seeing old friends here.

Excellent conclusion to our cruise,ColandNina,"We stayed here following our cruise from Hong Kong through to  Vietnam ending in Singapore. We stayed in a Marina View club room. The accommodation is excellent with a large bedroom, couch, writing desk with a variety of charging / points. The bathroom is beautifully appointed with bath and  separate shower. The Club Lounge was very good with good service by the staff, although I felt it unnecessary to close the buffet / drinks area during change over between differing food offerings.

All in all a beautiful hotel with excellent amenities and outstanding customer service.",5,February 2018,

The service the staff provided was outstanding and the rooms were an absolute delight. Each room, had an extremely comfy bed, sofa, robes and slippers and Luxuary toiletries.   The hotel is in a great location so you can walk to many near by attractions. Breakfast! Where do I start? By far the best breakfast I have eaten in all the hotels I have been to. The variety is endless. Literally different rooms or areas for different cuisines. They have everything!  If you like the finer things in life, then stay here if you are in Singapore. Could not recommend this hotel enough. ",5,April 2017,
Worth it for The Club Floor !,kade9,"The Ritz Carlton Millenia is a HUGE property so it can get very crowded so we decided to splurge on the Club Deluxe Room with access to the Club Lounge which is away from the hustle and bustle of the main hotel on the lower floors.

Every member of staff we met during our stay were extremely helpful, pleasant and courteous. Breakfast was included and there was a large variety of food available.

I went to the spa to get a few knots out after the flights and it was exactly what I needed. I understand the spa is new. It isn’t an elaborate spa but the massage service was great.

Fantastic upgrade!,Mary6404,"I stayed a couple of nights on business using Marriott Destination Club points (timeshare points).  I booked the cheapest room but got an upgrade to a huge suite with a fantastic view.  My conference was at the Marina Bay Sands which was an easy walk across the Helix bridge or a quick and inexpensive Uber ride.  Service was impeccable, and the room was beautiful.  I also enjoyed the pool area which is very tranquil and peaceful, even though it's in the middle of a bustling city.  Promenade MRT (subway) stop was close by as well, so there was easy access around the city.  I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to be spoiled rotten in Singapore.",5,November 2017,
From the start..to the very end,Zuee75,"Chosen Ritz for business trip instead of my other usual (which I will not name) for a couple of days. Wasn’t expecting much since the last time I stayed in this hotel was almost 10 years.  Ok..so I made a mistake!!  From the moment I had arrived at Ritz, a chirpy chap greeted me by my name, was I impressed. Asked how he knew my name, said it was MAGIC! Ha..and promised to tell me how he knew before I leave the hotel. Obviously the duh-me, my bag had a sticker with my name on it..he then escorted me to the reception, greeted by a young nice lady..I could have sworn that Ritz teaches everyone to smile 24/7 0 seconds! Thought I wouldn’t be able to get a room since I was early but they were kind enough to check me in (plus plus for me) and upgraded the room with a nice view over…",5,February 2018,
Top Class,Andy Hayler,"The Ritz Carlton overlooks the Marina Bay Sands complex, with a lovely view over the water from the upper floors on one side of the tower. We had a four night stay here in January 2018 (room 3017). The room was large with a lovely view, with a generously sized table with electrical sockets built in, and a separate area with sofa, table and chair. The bathroom was very large, with a powerful shower, double sink and separate bath, and copious fluffy towels. The room has many nice design features, and one or two odd ones. The various desk drawers contain all sorts of useful things. The writing desk drawer has assorted office accessories like a stapler, scissors etc. The desk containing the mini bar has kettle, teas, Nespresso machines, cups, wine glasses etc, and even the little…",5,February 2018,
Club Experience,max_fem,We stayed at the corner suite and the whole club experience was divine. The suite was impeccable and luxurious and we had the most amazing view. Special shoutout to the club team headed by Ms. Cora as they made our stay there extra special. Service was 5 star but it never felt pretentious. They even surprised my husband with a visit from the team and special treats for his birthday. We will definitely return...longer next time.,5,January 2018,
Amazing,HevCooke,"Had club rooms for the final leg of the trip and it was totally worth it. Staff couldn't be more accommodating, very knowledgeable. remember your name every time you enter somehow! Champagne free flowing in the club lounge, sent a bottle down for me to enjoy in the amazing bath overlooking the bay. Faultless.",5,February 2017,
A wonderful experience,Francis C,"Had a 2 day stay at the Ritz. Check in was a breeze and was attended to by Brandon Tan, Rooms Executive. He was attentive, bubbly and efficient .  My room was very comfortable and well fitted .  Room service was very prompt. The view from the room is breathtaking. Soaking in the bath, drink in hand enjoying the splendid view is treat. Its a delight to speak to any staff you happen to run into.....they take a lot of pride in their job. Really 6 star service. I have always enjoyed my stay with the Ritz and I will return . Thanks guys . Keep up the good work. You are world class and beyond.",5,January 2018,
Best hotel for family or biz trip,Unun218,"Travelled with husband and a 3-year old son for a business plus family trip at the end of January.  We received the most warm welcome when checking in and the process was efficient.  We ordered in-room dining for lunch and dinner most of the time, and the food quality was great.  Our room was 1911, and it was extremely spacious.  One thing though, was the bed.  It's too high and way too soft.  My back hurts so much after one night's sleep.  Hope the hotel would change the beds in the near future.",5,January 2018,
Most Luxurious Hotel,ChristineGoldie,This hotel is probably the epitome of luxury in my opinion. Almost all the rooms have beautiful views of Singapore and I can’t stop obsessing over the automatic bathroom blinds. Amazing! Also the breakfast was beyond delicious.,5,August 2017,
Fantastic hotel,catF1,"Travelled to Singapore for work and stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia.  Everything about this hotel is perfect! Simply could not ask for anything more.  Location is very good and train is not too far away.  The room and view were amazing.  Food was surprisingly very good.  Staff were great.  The pool area is huge.  If I seem like I'm gushing, I am!  This hotel is amazing!",5,January 2018,
Amazing Hotel,Liz Prescott,Stayed here for 4 nights on 8th Jan.   Beautiful hotel and wonderful staff.  Breakfast was amazing so much choice.  One of the lovely ladies even remembered my name 😁😁  Hotel was so luxurious.  I would definitely stay here again.,5,January 2018,
Excellent Stay,Anne M,"We could not have had a better stay in Singapore! The staff in this hotel were efficient and extremely customer focussed and I could not fault their attentiveness to the needs of their guests. The room was spacious and very well appointed and was everything we had hoped for. Loved the fantastic views from our windows - even when in the bath. If looking for a quick snack, you can't go far wrong with the chicken satay which was delicious.  My only regret is that we didn't manage to enjoy one of their afternoon teas which looked fantastic.  Would not hesitate to recommend",5,January 2018,
Full of Surprises,Sriyani,"If anyone is keen to celebrate a milestone birthday in style, I would recommend the Ritz Carlton Millenia in Singapore.  Having always travelled in the middle lane, I decided to do something different for my 60th birthday. I booked a Club Kallang room in the Ritz Carlton, which was their cheapest in the club category. When they learnt it was my 60th birthday, they surprised me with a celebration I could never have imagined even in my wildest dreams.  With an upgrade to a Suite beautifully decorated for the occasion and blessed with breathtaking views of the Marina Bay, they baked a delicious cake for me and had two birthday cards signed by  staff members & a rose petal bubble bath waiting for my arrival. Furthermore, every staff member on the Club level personally greeted me by…",5,December 2017,
Always a let down.,simon,I've been coming here for almost 15 years and this place continues to disappoint.   I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong with it but it just lacks a certain something   I don't choose to stay here I'm always being booked by my work   compared to the other hotels in Singapore it's a let down   it doesn't have a rewards system the rooms lack soul and it's perched out on the edge of Singapore.   And it's lobby bar is pants.    Give me the MO next door any day of the week,3,January 2018,
The best Hotel for family trip,hyunjungl2018,"my family visited Litz carlton millenium in Singapore, August. The family trip was for celebrating my daughter's birthday, do I write a letter the story.  When I arrived hotel, the manager was so kind and prossess was comfortable. The best thing was the Hand writing Card for my daughter! They collected the pictures of princesses which was my daghter's favorates! They surveyed it early by email. It was sooooo touchable and sensible!!!!  The room's view was very wonderful, all staffs gave me the greatest services. Everywhere - front desk, concierges, restaurant, lobby, kids playground...   I really thaks to manager and staffs of Litz carlton millenium in Singapore! and I hope to visit again someday~",5,August 2017,
Excellent buffet and location,Bob B,"Include the buffet in your package if possible, its well worth it.  Otherwise it's 45SD per day.  The location is perfect as you can easily walk along the Double Helix bridge to the Marina Bay Sands mall.",5,December 2017,
One of the best hotels in Singapre,ahmedaG7327ON,The Ritz Carlton is an icon in Singapore. The location and customer service is wonderful. The breakfast I think it is one of the best in Singapore. You can walk to many malls and see the harbor from your window. If you look closer at the hotel you will see signs of old age. The wood is worn-out and the gym is not that impressive. The lefts are little slower but you won't notice it is unless there are many people. Over all you can not go wrong with this hotel.,5,December 2017,
Excellent luxurious choice for city,Ash_Sad,"This is an old pending review which i have no idea why I didnt do earlier.  We stayed in Ritz Carlton for 2 nights as a short stopover before heading to Maldives for our honeymoon and decided to splurge on Premier Suite with return airport transfer.  We fell in love as soon as we arrived at the hotel. The lobby was impressive and the staff at check-in counter were very professional and all smiles. I had requested for 2nd Honeymoon Bath so as soon as we arrived at the lobby, we had to wait for about 30ish mins - which was fine by us as they served us drinks and teas and biscuits whilst we waited to go to our room.  The Suite itself was phenomenal. The bedroom and living room had expansive Marina bay views, and bathroom was huge with Singapore Flyer and Gardens by the bay views.…",5,February 2017,
This is a great hotel to stay in in Singapore.,Pep54,"Very impressive and enjoyable stay over 4 nights. Helpful staff, in particular, Lavin, went out of his way to explain everything we needed to know about the sites to see, the room and easy ways of getting to various places of interest.  Very satisfied with the cleanliness, location and standard of amenities.   Will not need to look anywhere else when we return.  Room with a view.",5,January 2018,
Marina tour,karlc576,This is a free guided tour about the history of the harbour piers now replaced by the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Bill our guide was a great speaker and made the tour so interesting that an hour just flew by. Well worth doing.,5,January 2018,
Never stay anywhere else,holidayshoes,Been coming since it opened in 90’s and don’t stay anywhere else this place feels like a home from home. Yes there are more modern and glitzier places but this place is welcoming and impeccable. Staff can’t do enough to help. The pool and spa are lovely too,5,January 2018,
opinion HOTEL RITZ CARLTON SINGAPORE,tervila,"I stayed 4 nights in this hotel booking a suite with marina bay  views. The room was ok light and airy and sparcely decorated. The only thing that I must criticize was the fact that a luxurious hotel like this has not staff who speak spanish in the reception or attending the phone calls. In addition, the breakfast menu has to improve, for example the fruit juices are not natural  simply package juices what is not the charactic from a 5 star hotel and the quality of the pastry products are medium.",4,June 2017,
Strange stay ....,Coates2014,"Acknowledging that we arrived late and left early, so the review is based on a short experience - it was bizarre. The club lounge was unwelcoming - despite being told we could still get something to eat there at check-in in our suite, we couldn't and we felt we were incredibly lucky to even get a drink. So, back to our room for room service - when we called we were put on hold and offered a call back that never came. When we rang again 20 minutes later - there was an almighty argument going on and we could hear it all - we even checked if the lady on the phone was ok. Very slow service. But it arrived with a smile and professional service in the room. Check out downstairs was good and efficient. Given the price of a suite and a club room - this stay was absolutely not worth it.",3,January 2018,
Simply Perfect,dineindulge,"Our room was high up in the sky on the 25th floor with the beauty of Singapore laid out before us.  The location is perfect for exploring the Marina Bay area and gardens.  A beautiful hotel.  Friendly, efficient staff, one of the best breakfast buffet's we have ever experienced.  I could go on and on about how good this hotel is.  There is a lot of competition for hotels in Singapore, but this is definitely up there with the best.  We enjoyed our stay enormously.",5,December 2017,
Amazing Staff,tiamark,"After 5 wonderful days, we are leaving the Ritz Carleton in Singapore on a cruise. The entire experience has been first class, but the staff has been exceptional.   We would like to note a few special ones, including managers, Mr Zabid and Mr Zong, Sharon & Sandrine & Sam in the Lounge and Lisa Cheah and the staff in the Summer Pavillion.   The newly renovated fitness center, huge pool and comfortable bed were important as we jet lagged from traveling 25 hours from NY. The location is perfect for walking to all the major sites like Marina Bay and the Gardens by the Bay and the major museums and malls.   If you are ever in safe, clean & sophisticated Singapore, we recommend you stay at the Ritz and we promise you won’t be disappointed. ",5,January 2018,
Service and accommodations exceed all expectations,BernhardK1,"We stayed for eight nights in a Club level deluxe suite. The view of the marina was stunning, the room beautiful and the service both in the club and the rest of the hotel was exceeding my expectations consistently through our stay. It is all about the little touches, learning my name, remembering my selections, greeting me with the biggest smile possible. The staff and management delivered consistently to the point that I was so sad to leave. The club is just great, the food and beverage selection is amazing and the club manager has formed an outstanding team! Every single team member shined! The breakfast buffet at the Colony is world class, the hostess remembered my name after one day! The variety of the food was great and the staff went out of their way at all times.

Perfect Hotel,Taniquan,"Everything about this hotel set a new paragon for class and sophistication. I have stayed at many Ritz hotels around the world and this one may be the best. The staff were attentive without being annoying. The hotel is in close to the waterfront and walking distance to shopping centers and attractions. It has a restaurant serving three buffets a day which are nothing short of world class. Especially the lunch which is spectacular. Plus a lobby bar with entertainment and a lively yet cozy atmosphere. My room and soaking tub overlooked the city. Beautiful views. Great rooms. Great service, great food, pool and everything else. I would highly recommend it and will be there when I return.  One point which others noted is that this hotel does not participate in the Ritz honors…",5,December 2017,
Fabulous stay!,RRJ5,"Booked the Marina Bay view room and worth every penny, the room and bathtub view directly viewing the Marina Bay, MBS and the financial district, most amazing hotel room view! Breakfast at their newly renovated restaurant also amazing, lot’s of choices and the ambience are luxury. Their newly renovated gym also such a gem, visited every morning during my stay. Their pool also looks very nice, sad didn’t have the chance to swim, but will do on my next stay for sure! Overall, I did not regret at all for my decision to changed my hotel in Singapore to this The Ritz-Carlton Millenia, look forward for the next visit!",5,October 2017,
Great Luxury Hotel,pdutt2016,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton over the New Year weekend from 30 Dec 2017 - 02 Jan 2018. The main purpose of our stay was to experience the New Year fireworks display. The check-in staff, Ms. Felicia Ho, was very efficient and not only upgraded our room but also assigned us to a room which had a dramatic view of the Marina Bay area and also ensured that we had a ring-side view of the fireworks display. Thanks to the consideration of Ms. Ho, we had a great stay at the Ritz Carlton and I intend to return to stay at this hotel the next time business takes me to Singapore.",5,December 2017,
"Good Hotel, Excellent service",Julius S,This hotel is Ritz Carlton standard what I mean is service are excellent fast and friendly. The room are quite big and of course nice. 2 times room cleaning everyday. However this hotel are not participate in Ritz Carlton membership program. Sauna and Jacuzzi also need to pay additional SGD35 which I think they shall give it as complementary facilities since hotel room charge already quite high.  Anyway overall staying here are recommended.,4,January 2018,
Amazing! What a room! And service!,CaioZanette,"Stayed there for 2 nights working. Room is amazing, huge, with amazing Sigapore views, just fantastic!

Exceptional as always,Bernhard K,"Our favorite hotel, definitely in Singapore, probably worldwide.  The rooms are very spacious, very clean, very comfortable big beds, big bathroom, great products, great view either of Marina Bay or the river/city.  The staff is very friendly, exceptionally attentive  and helpful and very well trained and organized. The breakfast buffet is one of the highlights why we love this hotel so much. The spread is unbelievably broad and of the best quality. Only drawback: you very likely eat too much 😃. The New Year Countdown Party and dinner buffet was great. A special thank you to Syarifuddin Bin Mashuri  We always like to come back to Singapore and especially to the Ritz Carlton. ",5,January 2018,
Will come back,Rossandmichelle,"This hotel is very good, from arrival through to food and all staff  I have nothing but praise. Club level the very best I have ever experienced anywhere. The gym and pool fantastic and up to date, towels, water, fruit in gym all good. I would like to kidnap the chefs who looked after us in the club lounge as the food they prepared for us in the mornings to order was done with care and kindness - right up to personally delivering to table on occasion.  The views from hotel (and bath) worth the stay on their own. Who ever runs this place deserves what they are paying them and some. Good job.",5,January 2018,

Amazing experience,jess-12875,"We recently stayed at the Ritz Carlton while in Singapore for a few days. This is by far one of the best if not the best hotel we have stayed in.   The service upon arrival had already set up the kind of high expectations of service we were going to receive. We were lucky enough to have a room with a stunning view of Marina Bay which you could just gaze at the whole day.   We went out a few hours and when we came back to our room, our slippers had been put next to the bed and the room made up for sleeping along with a little note from front desk thanking us for staying.   We were genuinely sad we had to leave the next day as the ritz makes you feel pretty special.   We will definitely be back again as well as staying at other ritz! ",5,December 2017,
Christmas Staycation,MOH A R,"A regular guest of the hotel, Ritz-Carlton Millennia have always been the number one choice for a staycation. Though the interior design of the hotel is old, they are still the True Ladies and Gentlemen of the hotel. The front line staff were polite and friendly to all the guests of the hotel. The only flaw of the visit was the lack of hit beverages ie coffee capsules and tea bags etc which are often provided in the room were not available upon check-in in. Have requested for the supplies during the turn down service provided but the request was not acceded to. Though I was satisfied with the front line service, the drop in the operational service ready room was not acceptable in my personal opinion.

We Get This Service Again,MathiasFankle,We stayed with our children and nothing was too much trouble for the friendly helpful staff throughout the entire hotel.

Disappointed with Concierge Service,jonathan,"1) Stayed here as a staycation. Invited a few friends over to accompany us for some drinks at chihuly lounge. When they were to return home , went to concierge desk to ask for 2 complimentary parking tickets but was rejected. Do note that I have spent $300 on drinks alone in the lounge and my room cost a bomb , nightly $810.  2) Went to Ritz club on the highest floor , and witness them chasing out a Korean couple with kids after 6pm but have to say that the staff ask them out politely. Not very good impression for a person who have kids like me.  3) The other area of service like front desk , check in/out, housekeeping etc are impressive though",3,December 2017,

My wife and I have been visiting this hotel for over 25 years now and while Marina Bay has grown around it this hotel continues to deliver a consistent and high quality service. From the moment you arrive until the time you leave you are met with friendly and efficient service, even when the demands on the staff were tremendous - as they were over this busy New Year period.   We enjoyed the Club facilities on the 32nd Floor during our stay and the quality of the offering is truly exceptional when compared with its peers.

Inside the Club Lounge views of Marina Bay was absolutely amazing and the food some of the best we've had in any hotel.. I was sick for a few days so spent majority of time in our room (3205) which was no issues whatsoever as the room were very larger and comfortable but a little dated.

Service could not be better, the food is freshly prepared and very tasty, drinks are served almost all day long and the views over Marina Bay are just amazing.

"A Nice Experience, Thanks to an Exceptional Staff",tvjuneaujr,"I was somewhat disappointed by the condition of the room, which showed signs of wear that I do not typically associate with a Ritz Carlton property.  For example, the floor was scuffed, as was some of the wood furniture.  The sofa was worn down on one of the arms, and the bathroom had a dark mark on one of the walls.  Moreover, a coating on the windows on the eighth-floor near the elevators appeared to be peeling away.  What the property seemed to lack in maintenance, however, was more than made up by the exceptional service experience.  On the first night of our stay, my wife and I were meeting a family friend and her son for dinner.  We had suggested the hotel, but later discovered the dining room was full.

Child friendly hotel,Norlilah S,"We are always on the look out for kid friendly hotels and this one really takes the cake. My boys had their fair share of pampering with their own kids bath amenities, free toys and treats, activities to keep them occupied in the room and by the pool, a turn down service so they get to sleep in their own beds(yayy for us parents!) and a kids playroom in the hotel itself!

Great location!,WTraveller9,"Well located in a walking distance to MBS. The view from our room was good. The breakfast is excellent and surely the reason i may go back to this hotel.  The rooms are spacious which is another good point, especially in S’pore. Nevertheless, the atmosphere of the room was cold and almost too neutral for us. Maybe it’s just a matter of taste... The service was THE disapointment for such an hotel of its category and expected standards in term of guest orientation. From the check-in till the breakfast greetings, we felt it was all about the procedures and making them to feel safe rather than making us feeling welcome and comfortable.

First thing they are not aware of that in my reservation breakfast is included or not, even I inform them but no-one try to double check it, even have to call several time and email.

Great Location & Fantastic Service,raodahz,"Great location to explore Singapore's marina bay area. Hotel connects to Marina Square and is just across Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade etc.  Service staff were friendly and went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was a memorable one.",4,December 2017,
Outstanding Service,Crameme8,"The staff went above and beyond making us feel welcome and providing a personalized experience for our 3 year old. She was treated like a queen, everyone going out of their way to make her feel special. The hotel interior could use a facelift; it’s clear the hotel needs one. However, the facilities were very clean and the service is outstanding. ",5,December 2017,
Good view and location,chrishX2759IK,"Great view, great facilities and clean, but many staffs are poorly trained. For example, staffs chatting amongst themselves at the buffet dinner rather than attending the needs of customers, cleaners forgot to put any towels after cleaning the room, front desk asks so many questions before trying to assist with your request... etc ",4,December 2017,
Xmas at Ritz carlton,lioneltan2017,"Best Xmas ever. Great place, very big room. Great view. Walking distance to canival and shopping Malls. Staffs are very professional , always greets you with your name.  They even have baby bed which is very very handy for my 7month baby.  Awesome stay. My family are very happy with the stay over Xmas in Ritz Carlton ",5,December 2017,
Stay Here,Gershman,We stayed here for 3 nights late November. Booked a Ritz Carlton club room with complimentary upgrade to a suite via our agent. Definitely not the cheapest hotel but soooo worth the extra money. We did our research online but this hotel stood out from the rest.  Rooms are by far the largest I’ve stayed in and are very comfortable. Club access is worth paying for with food and drink available all day (including alcohol). No matter where we were in the hotel the staff was always around to assist without being intrusive. Next time I’m going to Singapore I’ll definitely stay here again.,5,November 2017,
Spectacular hotel,0zahraa,The hotel was very nice .. we booked club room and it was city view.. The bath was very big .. The spa is the best spa I have been in It was 2 days but we  regret we did not stay longer..  For sure I will recommend my family and friends,5,December 2017,
Great location and Ritz service,EricJ,"Just ended our stay at the Ritz for the holidays. The hotel itself from the outside has a 70’s arquitecture feel (looks dated) and its main lobby areas although nice also feel dated. But cant hold it against it. The hotel’s decor is contemporary in muted tones, but still feels very elegant. What did surprise me was the room. The room was larger than most, with incredible views of the city. The bathroom was quite large, loved the toiletries and the multiple hidden doors and cabinets.  But overall, its the Ritz service which was impeccable and made our short stay quite enjoyable. On our last night a complimentary bottle of wine was waiting for us in the room from the front desk staff.  Cannot opine on the restaurants since we did not dine in hotel.  Location is ideal, as you have…",5,December 2017,
"Great hotel, comfortable and spacious",miles_for_smiles,"Great hotel for business trips. Conveniently located near the CBD. Rooms are modern and spacious. Service is great and you get the consistent Ritz-Carlton experience. Obviously comes at a price, but then again you expect that from a leading brand. ",5,December 2017,
Almost Perfect!,SK Y,"Spent the night of Christmas eve in Ritz Carlton . As we had always taken sea view rooms when we stayed in the other 3 hotels in the Marina South area, I opted for a Kallang view room instead. The view is simply stunning, and one that I have seen for the first time. I was given a huge room with two super comfy beds, a king-size and a single. If there is any suggestions to be made to the room, it would be to have 2 sinks instead of one in the bathroom . Service wise, it's fantastic, with every staff smiling, friendly and eager to help. Check in was slow but it was because I made the mistake of checking in at the Japanese services counter. The sweet young Japanese lady behind the counter seemed to have some trouble finding a room for me.  With only one pool, and being the school…",5,December 2017,
Beautiful hotel,meghanhinch,"I stayed here in November before I went on a cruise, I may have only spent two days here but honestly this hotel is beautiful!! I loved my room and didn’t want to leave! Definitely will be returning so worth a visit if you ever get the chance !! ",5,December 2017,
Amazing,Elizalilymum,The entire stay here was fantastic from the moment we arrived. We stayed with our 2 children and nothing was too much trouble for the friendly helpful staff throughout the entire hotel. Our room had everything we could possibly need and was clean with great turndown service. Breakfast was a great choice and what a treat for the children to have ice cream! We enjoyed spending time at the pool each day relaxing where we enjoyed some delicious snacks. It was sad to leave but happy to know we will return again in the future.,5,October 2017,
True Five Star Experience!,helfman,"We normally stay in luxury hotels while traveling to Asia, but this one has to be the best. I would happily extend my stay in Singapore just to stay here again. The service was top notch. Thank you Amirul for checking us in and remembering us by name every time we past the front desk. The view of the bay we had from the large room was amazing! The furnishings were top notch and the service from all staff was true Ritz Carlton. The ammenities including the gym were also great. I was able to do a true workout which is rare in most hotels. Also the location is very convenient to everything. I am currently staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel for one night and except for the rooftop pool, the Ritz Carlton beats it hands down. This Ritz Carlton will be our home for all future stays.",5,December 2017,
Expect the Unexpected,Karlo P,"A big fat W O W ......all i thought was it was just one of the ordinary hotels that we had been...if you are looking at the building itself it looks ordinary but when you go inside the hotel it was totally different. More so, if you go their rooms it was huge room with huge bathroom space. This is so far the best hotel that i had been to.",5,March 2017,
The BEST hotel in Singapore!!!!,Clare918,"We stayed 5 nights & the staff became like family, so friendly & attentive!! Knowing it was my birthday, housekeeping surprised me all week with balloons, birthday cakes & a bottle of wine& a birthday banner. Spa massages the best ever! The food& drinks in Chihuly Lounge perfect for light supper with wonderful staff. Also, dinner & dim sum at Summer Pavilion excellent. Kudos to housekeeping, Chihuly Lounge & Spa Teams.Returning from a 2 week cruise to do lunch again at this #1 Singapore hotel before flying home. Can’t wait to return to Singapore to stay here again!!!!!",5,December 2017,
Phenomenal experience from check in to check out,George G,"Special thanks to Ms Finn and housekeeping staff for surprising me with birthday gifts and room decorations. Felt overwhelmed and pampered by the attention I received on my birthday. Overall, the stay was nothing short of amazing. Will definitely stay here again. ",5,December 2017,
Wonderful Stay,awaywardtraveller,"The Ritz exceeded all my expectations, easily. Having stayed at many luxury hotels worldwide, occasionally writing reviews, I felt compelled this time. Rooms are wonderful. Large, clean, functional. The common areas great. Pool really exceptional. We spent many hours with our two young boys lazing away. But above everything, the service and staff was arguably the best I have ever experienced. From the door to the front desk and everyone in between. Really brilliant. A special mention to Erin at Colony. She was wonderful with the boys during breakfast and gave the boys a little farewell gift. ",5,December 2017,
Not really about hotel but breakfast with the family,Michael B,We didn't stay at the hotel but ventured here on my daughters 43rd birthday. We had been told the breakfast was exceptional and we certainly weren't disappointed! From the moment we entered the restaurant we were treated as royalty especially by a delightful young waitress who couldn't do enough for us. Our grand-children were especially singled out for gracious assistance and savoured the moment. The food and the available selection was to die (live) for and any requests were wholeheartedly welcomed and served in a manner befitting royalty. Would love to stay at this hotel as I would believe it would surpass it's 5 star rating.,5,November 2017,
Enjoyed my stay!,sy806,A good and comfortable stay - I enjoyed the service but the location was just slightly inconvenient.  It was difficult getting a cab at times so that proved a bit frustrating. The room was lovely and the view open and welcoming.,4,October 2017,
Not even close to five star.....,SohoJohn,"Five Star?  Not this property…  My wife, two daughters and I are midway through a nine day stay at the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore and I’m actually prompted to write a review before the end of our trip to underscore how underwhelming and disappointing this hotel has been.    THE HOTEL  It started a bit poorly with a really long check in.  We had just landed from a 12 hour flight at the night before we had stayed at a Park Hyatt where the check in was no more than one-two minutes.  Here at the Ritz Carlton, it was 10 minutes of just standing there while the clerk just continually tapped away at his monitor as if we were drafting his own version of Beowolf.  There was another guest standing behind us who clearly was in a hurry to check out (presumably trying to catch a flight)…",3,December 2017,
Ritz Carlton Singapore,lindacB8210CG,The Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff provide exceptional service.  It is one of my favorite hotels in the world to stay at.  The rooms are also beautiful and have wonderful views.,5,December 2017,
Stay at  The Ritz-Carlton Singapore,TongCBBangkok,"Excellent and attentive service from hotel staff as well the banquet staff at Summer Pavilion.

We enjoyed the stay and plan to have another stay for our family get together.",5,December 2017,
Still puttin’ on the Ritz...,djmontano,"I’ve always loved staying at any of the hotel chain’s destinations. This beautiful hotel has commanding views of the bay, even from your bathtub. The Summer Pavilion has excellent Chinese cuisine. Service is efficient and discrete. ",5,October 2017,
Very good but not excellent,orchideen2017,"The personal is very kind and warm. The views of the bay are very nice. The design of rooms is elegant but in our room we have a strong humidity odor, there is no windows to open and ventilation and aircon could not take out. ",4,December 2017,
Magnificent,Daria S,"Spectacular hotel, with a wonderful club lounge, great location, and fantastic amenities. Enjoyed every minute.

Excellent Service with humble attitude,Ronald O,"Being one of the high end branding in hotels, Ritz-Carlton has never fail to provide excellent service with warm smiles and humble attitude towards the guest. I had a great time during my stay and all my needs were attended to. When we requested for a baby cot, they even provided baby bathing essentials.   Great job and I will be looking forward to my next stay.",5,December 2017,
Stay at Ritz Carlton Singapore,cuilingpetrinac,Stayed there for 4 nights at Ritz. It was a wonderful experience. The rooms were well appointed and the deco warm and beds were comfortable.

Beautiful view of the Marina Bay,MKAJARIA1969,"We had booked a deluxe marina bay room inclusive of breakfast! It was for a special occasion to celebrate our silver anniversary! The guest relations of the hotel was prompt to respond to the special request of arranging balloons, cake , chocolate , fruits etc ( of course at an extra cost) before we arrived.This was a great surprise to my wife and she was very excited to see all these in the room.The view of the marina bay and marina bay sands hotel from the room as well as the bathroom was very special and was worth every penny we paid for the room.I would like to mention here that the room highly priced but we actually loved the views.We were in Singapore for 2 nights and were in the room fo quite a long tome to enjoy the great views, the lovely bathroom .The view at night was…",5,December 2017,
Good Spa Experience,Liz_MCKD,"Visited the Spa at the Ritz for a relaxation massage. In short - the massage was great, the facilities and overall service need a bit more attention to be truly luxury. As the staff informed me that I could use all facilities before the treatment, I arrived early to make use of that. The changing rooms are well laid out, as well as the powder room. They are providing various items as hairspray, comb, Deo etc, which is great, however despite being neatly arranged, some packaging was empty. The have a sauna, steam room (which was out of order at the time, found out myself as it wasn't pointed out during the show around), a jacuzzi and a hot salt (?) pool. Unfortunately there are no hooks around the pools to hang the bathrobe/towel, also the sauna wasn't hotter than outside…",4,December 2017,
An 'oldie' but a goodie - classic elegance,Adeleine,"Ritz Carlton is a safe choice for a luxe stay with its plush princess-and-the-pea beds that I can literally have to stand on tiptoe to reach and the gorgeous porthole windows that allow you to peer out on the Marina Bay area vicinity while having your bath.  As usual service is tip-top and efficient and the surrounds magically blocks off all noise from the city at your doorstep the minute you step through the entrance.    I took one star off because these days, Singapore is awash with sorts of 5-6* resorts like St Regis, The Fullerton Bay Hotel, Marriot's South Beach and my personal favourite, Capella.  And I'm sorry, le grande lady, Madame Ritz, but others may find their aesthetic and modern styling intriguing. You are, however, a classic in my book. A safe choice for the…",4,August 2017,

The Hotel is perfectly located, RIght opposite the Marina. Close to all of the main sites so its easy to get around. We took taxis everywhere as they are affordable and efficient.   Firstly on arrival we were greeted so warmly and everyone that welcomed us knew who we were and greeted us by name! they really treat you like royalty! Our room was ready on arrival and we were brought straight up to our room and check in was done in our room. we have never experienced this before and it was special. especially when we saw our room! - more on that…",5,December 2017,
The Ritz Carlton Singapore rocks!,318stirlingm,The Ritz Carlton in Singapore is a great place to stay.  I have never seen a hotel gym that rivals this one!

Terrific! Wonderful service,Yijia L,"The service was great! The manager, Evans was very helpful and hospitable. It made us feel very warmly welcomed.   Great view. Room was comparably large. Club Lounge was great with wonderful food.   The hotel service is good even for the breakfast place.   Hotel breakfast: great variety. A bit crowded. But the environment is nice.   All in all, one of the best five star hotels in Singapore. ",5,December 2017,
Beautiful Views,Michael John S,We were made to feel very special from the moment we arrived and were taken to check in by Lavin.

Ritz Carlton Experience -SINGAPORE,lesleyp461,We stayed at the RITZ CARLTON MILENNIA SINGAPORE  celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary.  We had the most wonderful welcome of Guest Services-Esther-  and our room organised by by Connie in reservations  was perfect  along with lovely welcome treats in our room.  We stayed for six days and experienced exceptional service in all areas.  The Colony Restaurant  has the most amazing array of food.  I would like to point out that the view of Singapore from this hotel is  is truly wonderful - we had a Marina Bay view from our room.  Our room was beautifully serviced each day and had an extremely   comfortable bed and pillows.  This is a large hotel however the level of service makes one feel very comfortable and cared for.   We would certainly return and recommend this hotel.,5,November 2017,

Fantastic!,Kathryn M,I loved everything about this hotel. The location is excellent and the hotel with abundant art work is beautiful. It was great to be able to purchase a baguette and some nice cheese along with a bottle of wine in their lobby. But best of all is the staff- incredibly warm friendly and helpful. I’d like to especially recognize Amiral Asyraf who checked me in- five star treatment! Thank you so much!! The view from my upgraded room was amazing!,5,December 2017,
Simply outstanding,355michaeldavidw,"What a wonderful stay, in every way. Nothing is too much trouble for the hotel’s wonderful, warm and genuine staff.

Consistent as usual.,Picardnj,I’ve stayed at the Ritz Millenia several times and find it consistent and enjoyable. The rooms haven’t changed over the past decade but still remain luxurious. Downstairs dining is amazing But was surprised by the morning ‘crowd’ at the entrance and felt this hurt the overall experience. I typically don’t like to wait online and it felt a bit like breakfast in Vegas. That said... food selection is nothing short of exceptional.,4,September 2017,
"Location, luxury, service",indylady,"Our second time at this hotel, and will definitely make it our choice in Singapore.

great atmosphere and people,Pappi,When ever I rate a hotel I start with the people that work there and the Ritz didn't disappoint they are professional and friendly.

The rooms are very spacious and modern and offer a great view over the marina bay - amazing to wake up here! Furthermore, the pool areas is very nice as well and welcomes you to stay for a couple of hours. Last but not least we also used the gym area: probably one of the best we have seen so far in 5 star hotels!

It was the third consecutive time in 3 years that we stayed at this Ritz Carlton; and somehow each time they managed to not only surprise us but also outdo their previous customer service excellence.  From the moment we arrived at the doors, there was someone friendly and professional to look after our needs.

"Great Hotel, but with one slight reservation.",Givemeaholiday,"I must start with the great staff especially the Concierge(s) they were all very good, and helped beyond the call of duty.  The rooms are splendid, as they are not standard, they are well appointed, and the room service is superb. The rooms though do need updating as they are starting to show some ages, but are far from tatty etc.  The one reservation is that to use the spa next to the pool which is the only place to change you have to pay s$35 ! but it is no issue as you can change in your room if you dont feel that you can justify the charge.  All in all, a hotel that lives upto the brand, and Ladies and Gentleman that exceed it.  Thanks, I will be back soon I hope.",5,November 2017,
Outstanding Hotel,n_singh74,The Ritz-Carlton is the best choice of hotel that you can make while in Singapore. I recently stayed there while on work and can say the team there always goes above and beyond to take care of you.

Great Management Let Down By Terrible Club Lounge Staff,Richard H,"My wife and I have stayed with Ritz Carlton in Singapore for over 10 years. It pains me to write this review. I'm at the hotel right now, and would never think I would be writing about such disappointing service from Ritz Carlton Singapore. This evening, I went to the club lounge with 6 year old daughter at 5:40pm to order her dinner. There is a no-child policy after 6pm. No problem. I ordered her a burger and fries right away and the order was taken. So I start to eat my dinner, and 20mins later we are still waiting for her food. You can tell what's coming. Long story short, at 6pm sharp the staff came over whilst I was in the middle of my food, to tell me that we needed to leave and that my daughter's food would be served in the room. Great.

Amazing experience,hanter90,"Great location, close to shopping and the train station. The breakfast at colony was great. We had a corner Kallang view which was suited to our needs. The gym was also well equipped and service overall was naturally top-notch",5,October 2017,
"Amazing service, beautiful room with a stunning view. Loved it!",KellyBon,"We recently stayed at the Ritz Carlton for seven nights. When we arrived at the hotel we were treated like royalty. From being greeted in the lobby, to being immediately shown to our stunning room by a friendly member of the Ritz Carlton team. Our bed was amazingly comfortable. The view from the bathroom (and the main room) could only be described as stunning - looking over Marina Bay. The pool area was lovely and even had a BBQ menu for the weekend. All of the staff were so friendly and accomodating. It was refreshing! And the location of the hotel was so convenient. A few minutes away from shopping malls and just a short walk away from the subway station (the public transport in Singapore is very user-friendly not to mention so clean). We loved the hotel and will definitely…",5,October 2017,
Good service,wongl36,Good service and clean for this hotel . Good also very nice . I like the location near to our favourite shopping centre . Will recommend more people come to stay . Price was reasonable. Hotel toilet was clean .,5,November 2017,
Stunning in Singapore,bleuette623,"The Ritz Carlton Singapore was lovely. We had an amazing Marina view room which was out of this world. You don’t need to go to a rooftop bar with a view like that! We unfortunately only stayed one night, but the service was top notch. They went out of their way to try to make my friends birthday special as well with a sweet note and cake. The concierge was very helpful during and prior to the stay. Very responsive and made all the dinner reservations asked promptly.   The hotel was very nice – clean, super central location and rooms were glorious! I can’t wait to stay here again and spend more time using the facilities next time.",5,October 2017,
Wonderful,Kmclean85,This was a fab hotel. The breakfast was one of the best hotel buffets we have had. Staff were very friendly- mr kong the door man was very helpful. Great pool! The location was central and has access to the mall. Would stay here again!,5,November 2017,
Fitness Centre,andrewjeffreyw,"one of the best fitness centre and pools of all hotels in Singapore. The gym has plenty of equipment and space, including a yoga/stretch room and is open all the time.

a place to be for staycation,purnadi kertonugroho,"Recently, in Oct 2017, for celebrating an event for our only precious daughter, I and my wife arranged a staycation. We were always impressed by the hotel's nice and comfy room as well as the lounge area which is so excellent, overlooking Singapore bay area. But as always, I a firm a believer that it is the people who make every company, every business and in this case, every hotel, great. It is the human behind the tool (or nice hotel property). So let me render compliments for the following individuals that had made our stay enjoyable and of course, for making my daughter to appreciate their services: (please accept my apologies for any typo mistake): - Ms. Jolyn who was the person welcoming us during check-in, Ms. Michelle, who served coffee & prepared chairs, Ms. Fong Yee…",5,October 2017,
No better place to stay in Singapore!,Susan R,"We have just had the pleasure of spending seven nights at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia. The whole-experience was excellent. We first stayed here for two-nights in 2016 but due to other commitments we did not really get a chance to enjoy what the hotel had to offer. However, this time we were able to spend time enjoying the fantastic room (and amazing view), the great pool area and we were able to eat some fabulous meals at the amazing Colony Restaurant. The breakfast spread is fantastic with the Eggs Benedict and Eggs Royale being absolutely delicious (thanks Jean and Danial). The Friday Buffet was amazing - with Chilli Crab, oysters, prawns and a range of seafood being to die for as was the beef (just to mention a few things - EVERYTHING was delicious and fabulously presented) All…",5,November 2017,

Jewel of Singapore,Bruce L,We had a lovely and enjoyable stay at the Ritz in Singapore. The two things that stand out were Adam at the concierge and the gentleman who received us upon arriving at the hotel. Very impressive. The rooms were large and spacious.

Amazing View and Excellent Service,Calvin N,"I was blown away by the service I received here. I’m a Royal Ambassador at IHG (there top 1% client) and Ritz Singapore Service had me beat by couple football field.   It is very easy to get to the hotel about (20 minute drive) and cost about $18 SGD on Uber from the airport. When I arrived I was greeted by the bell boys, they got all my luggage out and gave me a tag immediately and was walk to the counter by another staff.   Finn got me checked in and provided excellent service. I had some weird request and she was able to get me all sorted without hesitation. She really went above and beyond and I hope which ever management read this recognized her as an asset with customer retention.   The view was amazing as my room faced the Marina Bay Sands and Downtown Singapore.  …",5,November 2017,
Our stay was an amazing experience!,burra5,"This was a last minute booking taken to extend our Singapore holiday and no regrets at all.From the very beginning we felt so special with the lovely doorman who led us and waited, for check-in.

Beautiful scented toiletries and automatic blinds are just some of the perfect touches we won't forget about the Ritz Carlton.We would absolutely love to return here.",5,November 2017,
"Not notch, very classy!",Chip L,"I enjoyed a weekend at this hotel enroute to business travel to Malaysia.  The hotel is on the pricey side, but on par with similar properties in the Marina Bay area.  Room accomodations are top notch, no complaints at all.  Breakfast buffet is Incredible, but plan to take it slowly to enjoy it and get your money worth.  Location is great, right on Marina Bay and walking distance to nearby hotels, shopping and attractions.",5,November 2017,
Very special and full of details!,PaulinaBon,"This hotel is full of little details and surprises!  The rooms are very spacious and clean, te food is great and the restaurant is very pretty! There is not a lot of crowd (like most of the other hotels in Singapur) and everything seems to be really new or taken care of.  Service is really good and the people that work here are really really nice and always smiling and willing to help you!   Totally worth it! Won't stay anywhere else in Singapore! ",5,November 2017,
"Elegant, restful hotel in a great location",intrepid1406,"Like all the RC's that I've stayed in, this one is beautiful.  There's a wonderful fragrance as one walks in from the outside heat and a spacious, relaxing lobby.  The check-in was efficient and pleasant.  The room, facing the bay, was grandly proportioned.  There was also a stately bathroom with natural stone tiles, a wonderful shower and a bath, and a giant window over the Marina.  Everywhere you look, there are big fluffy white towels of different sizes. The whole place is done in blonde wood and tasteful touches.  The first night we had a reunion of friends in our room with 8 friends, and the room had both enough furniture for us all to sit on and did not feel crowded.  The pool is lovely and the attendants both help when you need them and don't pester you.  The water…",5,October 2017,
Disappointing,Yannis S,"This was my 3rd stay at this hotel. I used to think it was an amazing hotel.  Service remains good, not great. For example I had made a specific request for my room which was not followed. Issue got half-rectified quickly, but amazing service would have meant that the issue would have been avoided in the first place or fully rectified eventually.   Common areas are nice and breakfast is excellent.   Rooms are very well sized but in some cases oddly laid out (eg tv at 90 degree angle to bed).   What has changed compared to my previous stays (2015 and 2016) is that the rooms are now in significant need of a renovation. I checked out 3 rooms and they all had the same feeling. It just feels a bit run down.   If the rooms get renovated I will be staying again. Otherwise I would look…",3,November 2017,
Ritz never fails to deliver a 5-star experience,Adel0728,"Ritz Carlton is always my no.1 choice for hotel. Never get disappointed with the Ritz. Although the RC in Singapore is not brand new, i still had a great time there. Spacious room with excellent customer service. Love the bath tub and the window (great spot to take a photo!)  The most impressive thing was.. I previously posted a photo on my personal Instagram account. And the Social Media team in RC sent me a lovely card and printed out my photo (framed). That little surprise made my day! Now my boyfriend has something to put on his desk haha!  In addition, I would like to give a big thanks to the lady in concierge. She was very helpful with directions and suggestions.   Definitely will come back for another visit.",5,October 2017,

Beautiful hotel with even better rooms!,KKNL12,"We had a corner room and it was probably one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in.

The food was excellent as well. As always at the Ritz Carlton, the service was outstanding.",5,January 2017,
Exceptional Hotel,RandolphPhillips,"When planing my first trip to Singapore I narrowed my selections to two hotels, The Ritz Carlton and St.Regis. Two hotels in the same category of service, but two different locations within the city. I am not a fan of “large” corporate hotels, but was pleasantly surprised with the Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore. First and foremost the Ritz won the selection for my first visit due to the actual location. It is centrally located in the heart of Millenia Park. I arrived on a 5 am flight and understood that I would have to preoccupy my time until check-in. In most hotel chains they are extremely strict to their check-in policy, even with some Ritz Carlton in the chain.   Some of the most spectacular views from your suite. The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore staff could not have…",5,October 2017,
One of the best in Singapore,Chris S,"Just spent a night at Ritz Carlton Singapore. What a fantastic 24 hrs. Wish it was longer.

The downstairs pool and spa was the best place just to chill and relax. Exactly what I needed. I will definitely be back.",5,November 2017,
Unbeatable!,egdels,"This is a backdated review as I have just discovered my notes and realised that I never posted them on TripAdvisor. My wife and I stayed at The Ritz Carlton Millennia from 17th to 20th March 2017 in a corner suite facing Marina Bay on Club Level and once again (this was our fifth stay there) we were impressed with the exceptional quality of the hotel, its facilities and its staff. It was so good to be welcomed back to Club Level in such a charming, warm and friendly way by Cora and Chuck and to see Katherine again (who had done us a great favour on a previous stay and made the effort to come up to the Club Lounge to see us). We regard them as old friends now! Ritz Carlton is very lucky to have staff of their quality.  In fact, all the Club Level staff were impressive for their…",5,March 2017,
Fantastic 5 day stay,andrew h,"Stayed again at this excellent hotel.  Stayed on club floor so we had all its amenities (food presentations, and drinks from bar all day as required). As before staff were excellent - really welcoming and friendly, nothing too much trouble even when busy and stretched.  Pool and gym were excellent - clean, good range of machines and free weights.  Really good location on Marina bay - great for walking/jogging and gardens on the bay.  This is a 5 star place that excels at service.",5,November 2017,
Incredible,Adam C,"Stayed for one night in a club premiere suite.  Upon arrival we were taken to the club level where check in was swiftly completed while we enjoyed drinks over-looking Marina Bay.  The suite was stunning with incredible views, a super comfy bed, and all the amenities you could wish for.  What set this hotel apart from others is the level of personalised service provided.  The staff on the club level were genuinely engaging, super friendly, and nothing was too much trouble.  As we were only spending one night in Singapore, time was not on our side.  Fong Yee and Lendl absolutely went out of their way to organise our stay in Singapore, with recommendations, maps and directions provided.  The level of service we received from these two was unparralelled and they are an absolute…",5,November 2017,
A genuine and warm hotel experience,hafizimranbinahmar,"I spent four nights at the hotel for a conference at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.  From the minute I stepped out of the cab until the day of check-out, the staff had been accommodating to my needs, some going above and beyond my expectations.  For first-timers, there are two sides to the hotel- one facing the marina and the other facing the highway.  Obviously the marina view is better, so spring for that if you can.  Additional info:  The walk to Sands via the Helix Bridge takes about 15 minutes (leisurely pace).",5,November 2017,
Never been better,UthyFebrianti,"Hi, I never been in love with some of specific hotel, yes not before Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore. This place is whole kinda perfection things.

Truly exceptional,Elaine K,"My husband and I have just returned from a 10 night stay at the Ritz Carlton, Singapore. We chose the hotel due to its location and consistently good reviews and we weren't disappointed, in fact our experience far exceeded our expectations.   From the moment we arrived, we were met by friendly, warm and welcoming staff. We stayed in a Club Deluxe Marina Bay room on the 27th floor, the views were spectacular, the room was luxurious. Great attention is paid to every detail.   The jewel in the crown is the Club Level service and lounge. Sheila, Chuckie and the team are exceptional.

Lovely Location for Stopover,Andrew P,"Stay: 1 night in October 2017, for overnight stopover between Zurich and Melbourne.  Lovely 5-star hotel. Very elegant hotel foyer and interior.  Staff: English speaking, extremely friendly & helpful. I was given a very early complimentary check-in after arriving from Zurich which was greatky appreciated. I was also given access to a second ""sleeping room"" on a lower floor during the day due to noise from renovations occuring near my room, so they went out of their way to make sure I got some quiet during the day. I was left with the impression that they would do everything to ensure you have an enjoyable stay, so I will be back again in February 2018 and beyond.

We both agreed that this has been our best hotel stay yet. We were in a Club Deluxe Marina room, on the 30th floor. Views from the room over the Marina were just perfect. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel special. Staff went out of their way to call us by name, always helpful and always smiling. Breakfast at the Club Lounge was fantastic and our visits at other times of the day were perfect, with sublime culinary delights on offer. Our room, as was the rest of the hotel, was spotless.

Top notch,Darrell C,As per typical ritz properties this one did not disappoint.  Check in was seamless and staff were super friendly and tried to ensure I had a handle on what the hotel had to offer.  Door service staff at multiple entries were there with a friendly hello to welcome me back from my daily adventures. Location is exceptional with a convenient walk to many core attractions. Room was super clean and impressive even with the staff asking me if I would be fine with some local noise during the day before giving me high higher floor with a view.  I’ve stayed at another hotel very close and would definitely rate the ritz many steps above. I will be returning to the hotel on my next trip to Singapore.,5,November 2017,
Great Stay so far...,khatijahbinteh,"Impressed with the service thus far. The service provided by most Ritz Carlton Hotels KL and Singapore are consistent and impeccable. One suggestion though - could have provided a complimentary room upgrade in view of first time stay and birthday staycation - special occasion. The room dining was good but the bread and rolls are tough. Housekeeping very prompt in service. Great sleep! Love the bed but one of the side bed lights was not working. Should have a bidet in the toilet for easy access to water use. Shower ensuite flooring stained and looked run down. Overall, we had a good stay in Ritz Carlton.",5,October 2017,
No points for staying in this property,Akshay Bhor,"Was utterly surprised that you are not eligible for Marriott points if you stay in this particular Ritz.

"싱가폴 최고의 럭셔리 (One of the best in Singapore, or maybe the Best)",SjunH,"가족과 3박을 하는 동안 모든 면에서 최고였습니다.  도착에서부터 체크인까지 매우 늦은 시간이었지만 물 흐르듯 진행되었고, 특히 라운지 운영시간이 지난 시간이라 직접 몇가지 음료를 챙겨다 주신 라운지 담당 스태프의 배려에 감사했습니다. 일반 객실에서 스위트로 업그레이드를 받았는데, 청결 상태, 공간, 구비된 어메니티 모두 최고였습니다. 특히, 스위트에서 보이는 마리나 베이 전망은 싱가폴 최고라고 단언할 수 있습니다. 호텔은 쇼핑몰, 편의점 등 주요 지점과 가까운 위치에 있어서 편리했습니다. 클럽 특전으로 이용한 라운지 조식은 음식의 가지수가 아닌 품질과 맛의 측면에서 만족스러웠습니다. 클럽 특전 중의 하나로, 근처 지역까지의 무료 리무진 이용이 매우 유용했습니다. 클럽 특전 중의 하나인 홍차(또는 커피도 가능) 서비스와 함게 추가로 주문한 칵테일은 친절한 룸 서비스 직원 덕분에 더 맛있게 즐길 수 있어서 좋았습니다. 세탁 서비스를 이용하였는데, 서비스 시간, 배달된 세탁물의 상태 모두 만족했습니다. FHR 특전 중 하나인 공항 송영 서비스를 이용하는 중에 발생한 문제(가방이 리무진에 실리지 못함)에 대해서 리무진 운전사 및 벨 데스크 직원의 협조로 빠른 시간안에 해결될 수 있던 점에 대해서 특히 감사를 표하고 싶습니다. 옥외 수영장 개선 공사 때문에 다른 호텔의 수영장을 이용하였는데, 이동이 약간 불편했지만, 오히려 특별하고 기억에 남는 경험이었습니다. 짧은 투숙 일정으로 친절하고 따뜻했던 호텔 직원들과 더 친해지지 못한 아쉬움과, 충분히 호텔 시설과 서비스를 즐기지 못한 아쉬움이 큽니다.…",5,November 2016,
Nice Rooms and Very Good Dining,Ian,"This is a solid hotel with nice view rooms. Value for money is quite good too. They take a lot of care on dining which they succeed in terms of quality of food at both the main dining room and the really nice Chinese restaurant called Summer Pavilion (try the bamboo or razor clams, super good!). Only negative comment on the dining is the layout of the chairs and tables in the main dining room feels like walking through a maze (the feng shui can't be good!) and only gives a tiny bit of walking room between tables which is a big inconvenience when it's crowded with customers getting up and down for buffet.",5,August 2017,

The front of house staff member too was equally as fantastic upgraded us without a word of askingnand even brought us a random box of chocs during the stay. The room itself was wonderfully large, with an incredible panoramic view whichever window you looked out of, felt like scarface as I sat in a big golden bath looking out onto a well lit Singapore. Pool was wonderful day or night, with the only tiny critism is the price of drinks round the pool but worth it for a night of chilling.. Gym and fitness studio and spa also top notch!!

Let Down. Disappointed by Banquet Service Level,Gielock,"Organised an 1-day conference for 100 at the Chihuly Room at this hotel. The grandness of the hotel is undisputed with a great buffet spread. However, the attention level was low which was unexpected from such a 6-star hotel. Staff stationed during the conference should be part-timers. Either they are not well trained or they have not been given clear instructions to serve beverages well and freshening up the conference room during lunch, to prepare it for the second half afternoon session. Security briefing could have been done at a more professional level.  Guest rooms are 1st class. Same cannot be said for the conference side of things.",2,October 2017,

The executive chef and his staff brought our son into the kitchen to decorate his birthday cake.  They all sang happy birthday to him, too!  Our family and the Ritz-Carlton then celebrated his birthday together over brunch and cake!   Magnificent!",5,November 2016,

Thank goodness we were on the Club floor.  The concierges took us in tow and assisted my husband by suggesting what he might bring me from their all-day extensive food & drink offerings.  Soup, hot tea with honey, etc.  The staff unfailingly asked him how I was doing, and made him feel welcome and at home.  And they were all so sweet to me when I finally was up and about.

Salty to Sweet,theharsh33,"I took my family on a short stay at the Ritz in Singapore from 20-22 October. I had chosen a Deluxe room and upon entering things seemed fine but the reality was that the shower in the tub for the kids leaked and it went all over the bathroom. I went down and spoke with the front desk and within 30 minutes they had said that they were going to move us to a new room. They were swift, apologetic and helpful. The new room was a Suite and it was terrific. To top it off they set up a tent for our kids in the room as part of the Ritz Kids program and after coming back from the pool on Saturday there was a dessert platter and a bottle of champagne from the staff. Unexpected and just shows the level of service that the Ritz provides. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,October 2017,
Perfect getaway to celebrate with ur love one,Bernard Yap,Personalised service and provide a simple cake for my Wife when they know I’m celebrating her birthday for her during the stay. A big thank you to all hotel staff. Lovely lounge service and food with vegetarian options,5,October 2017,
Amazing 65th Birthday weekend at The Ritz !,Bill M,"From the moment of arrival our experience at the Ritz was exceptional. As it was a birthday weekend we were double upgraded to a corner suite. All staff were genuinely interested in making our stay memorable. They decorated our room in the birthday theme while we were in the lounge. We received a gift each day for the birthday girl. I cannot think of how our stay could have been any better. We will return in June 2018 to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary. The Ritz Carleton is a step above in price and we feel it was worth every penny. Even at that money does not actually buy you the genuine hospitality we experienced. To a person, the staff were exceptional.",5,October 2017,
My new favourite in Singapore,HKExpat888,"Stayed here for 3 nights in October 2017.  Big rooms - all of which have great views.  Room service prompt and delicious, well equipped modern gym and yoga room, Colony buffet breakfast had great choices, plentiful supply of taxis outside to get around town.  All this was coupled with staff who genuinely would go out of their way to make your stay the best ever.  Thank You RC Singapore ad see you soon!",5,October 2017,
Home away from home...,SingaporeStef,"Work prevented us from a vacation and we were in dire need of a restful weekend so to the Ritz we went.   It has always been a sentimental favourite and this stay proved yet again why it will always be our number one choice. We opted for a room with club access for the first time and there will be no going back after this. From the booking assistance to the check in, and all throughout our stay, the team at the hotel and Club not only took absolute care of us, but surprised us with their sincerity, warmth and generosity.   Excellent service can be delivered like clockwork but to add the personal side and let us come away with a lasting impression is rare. Thank you to Cora, for her kindness and care throughout our stay…we thoroughly enjoyed our conversations and treats. To the…",5,October 2017,
Birthday Celebrations at The Colony Restaurant,Patrick,"By popular vote (consensus), including our two birthday gals, my beloved wifey, Cecilia and our beloved daughter-in-law, Armie and moi, our combined birthday celebrations' venue is at the rather 'atas' Colony Restaurant, Ritz-Carlton Hotel. One really 'shy' item here is eat-as-much-as-you-can grilled lobsters. Why shy? Because the chefs can never prepare enough for the diners who are constantly rushing to get their fair share of this 'blue moon' delicacy. Another rare item is their Beef Tomahawk Steak which is cooked to your preference and choice of 4 sauces to cater to all palates. Even for the bread table, we are spoilt for choice with a total of 12 types and of these, there are 3 kinds of bread that is free of gluten. And the butter provided is the only brand that I have not…",5,October 2017,

Exceptional Experience,Lin,"This is one of the best business hotel experiences I have ever had in an international metropolitan. The location is convenient and perfect to secure a terrific view that is one of a kind in Singapore Bay Area. and the interior design of the lobby area is impressive and grand. I stayed in a club premier suite and the room was phenomenal. It had an enormous separated living area and study. The bedroom had a walking closet and a wonderful bathroom. It had to be pointed out that the view of my room was breathtakingly gorgeous. I could basically sit there and enjoy the view all day long.   The check in services for club guest was first class and the club service in general (food and drinks) made my stay a savory one for sure. The hotel offers limo drop off service, which I used and…",5,October 2017,
Best hotel in town,thih0ngnhungn,Ritz - Carlton has great location and best services with professional attitude from staff. I have experiences the great customer services provided during my stay for the business trip during 1 week in Singapore.,5,October 2017,
Excellent hotel,PL49,"Excellent hotel stay in Singapore and more then friendly staffs provide you excellent service. From check in till Check out, you feel hotel really care about your stay and treat you really as their valuable customer, very good to stay in here. Bye he way, the location of this hotel is very good, if you like the bay view, you must chose the Marina bay view, it is fantastic. If you like to do shopping the big shopping mall also few mins by foot. Although this hotel is not cheap in rate but it is good to increase your hotel budget in this one.",5,October 2017,
First class experience,Kristina S,"We have decided to stay at Ritz-Carlton Millenia after a lot of discussions, as there is so much to choose from in Singapore. We got a great deal for the “Club” floor and that was the decision point. After 12 hours on the plane, we were taken to the hotel for private check-in (part of “Club” deal), set in the Club Lounge on 32nd floor and offered drinks while our papers were processed. What and amazing, really million dollar view the Lounge offers, with breakfast served, as well as complimentary drinks and food offering for most of the day.   After check-in, we were taken to our Premier Club room on 27th floor - - probably the nicest city room I have ever seen. Living area, office, bedroom and bathroom all overlooking the Marina Bay (see picture attached). Wow! The view at night…",5,October 2017,
Perfect to a fault!,Amazing Grass,"The RC hospitality is something no other hotel can replicate. We were received very warmly by all levels of staff (even the cleaners and maintenance crew), who provided very prompt and excellent service without making you feel uncomfortable. I don't know how it's possible to be treated like family and royalty at the same time but I know that Ritz Carlton has nailed it. It was extremely thoughtful of the staff to have prepared suitably-sized bathrobes for my partner and I, despite it being our first time there. We had a corner suite which came with breathtaking views of both the sea and the city skyline. I cannot wait to be back again!",5,September 2017,
Outstanding customer service,NGXX,"The moment we arrived we were met by Mahesh, who checked us in while we had some refreshments in the club lounge. Mahesh checked in on us throughout our stay, he’s a great ambassador for the hotel. Room was fab with a view of the marina which was breathtaking.  Club lounge was excellent, but it was the staff that made our stay so memorable, Cory the manager and her staff are genuinely caring and kind people.  Chef Sunder looked after us so well, and made us dishes that were divine, this guy really loves food, and has a passion for customer service. Can’t wait to go back.",5,October 2017,
An Experience Like No Other!!,Leslie G,From the time we arrived until the time we left I have one word to describe this hotel - Perfection!!   The room was excellent and the views were out of this world.   The food was divine and the surroundings were incredible.  But the best part of the hotel was the service.   The staff were exceptional.   Nothing was too much trouble and they made our stay one that we will never forget   A special mention must go to Alexis who greeted us when we arrived.   She went out of her way to ensure that our stay was one to remember and made sure that our anniversary celebrations were very special and definitely memorable.   Impressions are everything and Alexis made sure that we will definitely be back.   Thank you.  Looking forward to our next stay.   Leslie & John Gilham,5,October 2017,
Treated like Royalty,visvalingamn,"We have stayed in many of the top hotels in Singapore over the last 20 years. Most are fairly good; however the Ritz-Carlton (RC) tops them all. Everytime we arrive at the RC it feels like we are home.   We usually book into a Club Room. During our recent stay, we were simply overwhelmed. The service was excellent and it looked like a lot of planning had been done before we arrived and the tiniest details had been looked into. We felt like Royalty.  The staff at the Club Lounge and Reception are amazing. They work hard, are so pleasant, and all requests are attended to so efficiently. People like Chuck, Isis, Ms. Reyes, Ami and the rest have raised the bar at RC.  We will give the Club Manager, Ms. Sheila Benzon, a 10/10 for service quality, warmth and friendliness, efficiency,…",5,October 2017,

Fantastic Stay,Witmer,I stayed at this property at the end of a group travel trip throughout Asia where we slept in very low budget hotels and this was a perfect way to cap off the trip in a luxurious hotel. At this property I had a fantastic experience. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating and even upgraded my room to a corner suite with a view of the bay. The amenities of the room were all very high quality and the location is great for both business and personal. The views are as good as it gets,5,December 2016,
Hotel with renovation,monnpapatt,"A little surprise upon arrival that there is noisy work going on due to renovation on a higher floor, as a result, the rooms were sold out and we can't get our room ready by 3pm as promised, other than that the breakfast, room cleanliness, in-room dining and banqueting were excellent",3,October 2017,
Perfect Hotel of Singapore,KevinXYFang,"Singapore Ritz-Carlton is my first luxury hotel experience. I have stayed at this hotel twice. With large room and luxury furnishing, I have a wonderful time here. All the staff is quite polite and helpful. The breakfast is quite good and has various options. If you have the budget, the Bay view room is worth staying.",5,July 2017,
Delicious food and great service at Summer Pavilion,JoeIIe,Visited Summer Pavilion for the first time since their renovation and I love the new decor! Elegant and cozy. Food and service were top-notch. Specially enjoyed their king prawn with homemade sauce - deceptively simple looking but full of flavour. Staff were super attentive and they refreshed the entire pot of tea instead of just adding hot water to it (as with other Chinese restaurants I've been to). Will definitely be back soon.,5,September 2017,
Great view,Leprottinis,"The hotel is really nice, rooms are spacious and with a great view. The tube was right in front of a window: perfect to relax after a day of work or shopping! staff was really nice and helpful.  Breakfast is amazing and the swimming pool is great.",5,September 2017,

Very good hotel but no smart tv,sami A,The hotel is very nice it had all the services except few such as smart TV and kids pool was missing. The staff were all very polite but I encountered one lady who was in one word racist. Apart from that particular staff everything was perfect.,4,October 2017,
Best Hotel in Singapore,Grace C,"This is probably the best Luxury hotel in Singapore I'd say! My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday staycation here and I was blown away! I love bathtubs and this bathtub was unbelievable, providing a breathtaking view of Singapore's city lights! It was comfortable, spacious and anti-slip unlike a lot of other bath tubs out there (this is great for bath tub lovers hahaha). The service was good too! AND THE FOOD AT COLONY! Wow. Especially the seafood. One of the best hotel buffets ever. Loved the spa experience too which was expertly done.",5,August 2017,
Very good place to stay...,F S,"Well, without further due, this place was amazing. The view was mesmerizing and the staff was incredible! Everything was perfect stay wise.   Only thing I can complain about is that when I booked on the website, I wasn't made aware that this hotel is not part of the Marriot/Ritz award program. So booking a suite for the entire stay and not earning points would have probably made me go to a different place. That being said, if you don't mind not getting about 60K points back for a staying at a suite, then this is the place to stay! <3",4,March 2017,
"Great view, but forgettable",bradleythomasi,"The marina view and view of the city was outstanding.  Service in the dining and bar area left a lot to be desired.  Concierge services were not helpful at all as well for excursions outside of the downtown area.  The room was clean and comfortable and the room service dining experience was also nice.  The bell service and front desk were excellent as expected with the name, but overall for the money I would stay at the Marina Bay or other hotel nearby.  Views from the Singapore Flyer and other locations gave plenty of breathtaking photo opportunities night and day.    It was only afternoon tea, bar, and concierge services that left a bad taste in my mouth.  You'd be better off booking excursions and traveling online and outside of the hotel's services including money exchange.",3,October 2017,
"Great hotel, great view!",yinhsienc2017,"Hotel was great!  Host was great!  Food was great!  Location was perfect and very modern decoration. We booked through American Express and received 4th night for free, also a free upgrade to a suite! Very good experience.",5,October 2017,
Douglas was superb!,Stewart A,"We checked in at nearly midnight but the service was amazing, firstly from Isis on the door service then onto Douglas on the desk who needs a very special mention!  He was so helpful, happy and polite and then gave us an amazing 'Surprise' room upgrade by not telling us but walking us up and then opening the door to an amazing Bay view facing suite.  Amazing views, staff were all so helpful and polite and our stay was fantastic, nothing was too much effort for the team.  The in room dining was great quality and speedy.  We had drinks in the bar one evening before going out which again the service was great and the view of the huge great big Sun art piece was great.  Its a shame they didnt have a dress code in the bar mind.  Highly recommended to stay at the Ritz!",5,September 2017,
EXCELLENT SERVICE,crajak2017,Exceptional Service.  Great View.  Quality meals and wine offered at the Ritz Club Lounge.

Just Splendid!,TravelingMermaid23,"We had moved to the Ritz after a disappointing stay at the Mandarin Oriental next door.   I had tagged along with my hubby as our anniversary coincided with his business trip.  We booked a deluxe room and were not disappointed!  - Rooms are bright and airy with beautiful views! - Service was above and beyond! - Breakfast was one of the best EVER, truly five star. - Room Service burger was great! - The gym was airy with all the latest equipment.  The concierge team were super helpful in recommending places for us to go and super friendly and accommodating.   I have nothing bad to say about this hotel at all!  Keep up the good work!",5,September 2017,
High standards,P2S,"Our second visit and stay at the Ritz. We were offered a room upgrade to accomodate the family. Although an expensive option, the room was spacious enough for the extra beds and views were amazing. The club access was well worth it. The staff were courteous and helpful. The location of the hotel is spot on and is walking distance to many attractions and shopping. The dining options in house are excellent and one is spoilt for choice.

Could have been Better,634joshua,We stayed as a family at The Ritz-Carlton for 6 days.It is a great hotel but could have been better.We got so bored with the Breakfast menu which was the same for all the 6 days.Even the order of the dishes was just the same to an extent you can serve yourself blindfolded.We could not get the Marina Bay view as were asked to pay up extra - which was again disappointing considering the fact that we stayed for 6 days.The staff are very good even though the front office staff when we checked in was not very friendly.Special mention to Azreen who was excellent and probably one of the best staff in the hotel. Will try out a different hotel the next time.Not recommended for families but very good one for Business trips.,3,September 2017,

Colony Restaurant,barrister6777,"Although the food at Colony was excellent, it is the staff who are the real reason you must eat here.

Very disappointing club experience,Gary C,The Ritz Carlton Club was a very disappointing experience compared to most other hotel clubs. The food selections and quantity were very poor. The club room itself was very small and had that cramped in feeling. If you choose to have your breakfast in the restaurant area you were charged extra for the privilege. There was just no atmosphere in the club room that made you want to be there.,3,September 2017,
"Beautiful hotel and staff are so helpful , great location , Marina bay side view is side to be on ",Darren S,"Fantastic hotel , food is sensational, only downside is we did not have a marina Bay side view , still a great stay here we are in the 10 th floor and facing the away from Marina Bay still no noise from the highway , fantastic staff , great location , Singapore on a whole is expensive compared to Australia in having a drink so wine and beer is $25 glass of wine and $19 a beer plus service fee and there goes a $50 note . So don't sit at the bar and think it's going to be a big night unless you have won the lotto . Loved the atmosphere at the bar area with someone playing piano and a nightly singer . We leave the hotel this evening and have opted for a late check out of 18:00 as we have a midnight flight which is also a great service . Thanks to everyone for a Fantastic stay 6…",5,October 2017,

Went out of their way to help,Nikki070103,"Just got home yesterday after a 6 night stay.  My 7 year old daughter was very ill on our last night and we had to extend our stay by one night.  All of the staff we had dealings with went out of their way to assist from housekeeping to on duty manager Sarah, to in room dining - Casey.  Connie in Colony restaurant and Esther on the front door.  We had to get a doctor to visit 3 times in 12 hours and they organised each time and were constantly checking to make sure we were ok.  My only advice would be is to ask for a room away from the lifts.  I could hear the lifts going up and down all night.  There is also a lot of noise from outside the building - we were awake past 1230 at night due to loud music - not from hotel.  Maybe ask for a very high floor.  We were on 16 but it was…",5,October 2017,

Very very satisfied indeed.",5,August 2017,
Perfect location and perfect services but breakfast options not much !,S_alaraidh,"I think the name of the ritz Carlton speaks of its self , however the rooms in this hotel and the toilet is huge comparing to any 5 star hotel I have been into even to other ritz Carlton hotel around the world.  The hotel in the best location you can possibly have in Singapore , everything is in walking distance or at lesser short trip in a taxi .  My only comments was the choices they have in breakfast , all the Asian type of breakfast were there but not western or at least they are not fresh ( no fresh Pancake) . ",5,November 2016,
Club Lounge vs Ritz Kids,Regine_SG,"My family and I had a 3 night stay at Ritz Carlton SG.  The 1st night was at Club Kallang and for the 2nd night we switched into the Premier Suite for the Ritz Kids Night Safari Adventure package.  There were 3 of us. We were surprised that the bellman could address us when we arrived.  That was truly appreciated. The services from Club Lounge were generally fine, notably a pleasant lady who serves the tables in the morning and making sure the guests were comfortable.  Unfortunately, there were 2 staff who cannot manage the guests' requests well and made the stay at the Club utterly disappointing.  I can't believe a hotel staff can tell off the guests and I felt uncomfortable waiting in the Lounge while the Suite was getting ready On the other hand, the services from Charis and…",2,September 2017,
If I could give six stars,Tony P,"This hotel is amazing. From the moment we walked in to the time we left we were treated like honoured guests.

Every mod con available but definitely the staff make the difference. Can't wait to our next visit to Singapore",5,September 2017,
Avoid non harbour facing rooms,Jones888,Besides missing the great harbour view you will hear highway noise all night.  The road is busy and the traffic seems to echo behind the Ritz the Mandarin and another hotel in the vicinity.    I would take any harbour facing room at any other of the adjacent but less well appointed properties rather than have to listen to a highway run through my room. If you cannot get a harbour facing room then do not stay here.   The rooms are large by Asia city standards. House keeping and staff is up to snuff.   The breakfast and lunch buffet is extravagant. The sushi restaurant on the property is a solid dinner option.   For anyone with jet lag or that is easily awoken avoid the ritz speedway rooms.,3,October 2017,
Exemplary experience,Dramarix,"We had a fantastic time from the minute we checked in to the moment we checked out. The Location cannot be beat. The check in process was a breeze and super accommodating. We absolutely fell in love with the view from the room and thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast spread every morning, the piano bar for drinks in the evening and the spa was superb. It was one of the very best massages I’ve ever had.  The concierge was also delightful to work with. 5 stars all the way. Keep up the good work guys. We will definitely be back. ",5,September 2017,

Stunning honeymoon upgrade and an amazing breakfast!,ALFL,You can tell that this is a more classic style hotel but it's got a very luxurious and timeless feel to it. We stayed here on honeymoon and got an upgrade to a suite with a jaw-dropping view of the marina and the bay. It was spotless and again the staff could not do enough to help us. Singapore is expensive and the drinks were exceptionally so in the hotel bar - just a word of warning! The breakfast was honestly one of the best I have ever ever had. You could not want for a bigger or better selection of food. It was worth the wait to get seated in the morning. The hotel is in a good location - around 15 minutes from Raffles and only 5 minutes from the white lion at the head of the marina bay. Easy to get taxis though from the front of the hotel and only moments away in a taxi to…,5,September 2017,
Simply Wonderful,Jason L,"This is the 2nd hotel on our trip to Singapore. The first was great, but when you set foot in a Ritz-Carlton, the bar is always set so much higher. It’s all about service plain and simple. Don’t get me wrong, the hotel if fabulous and our room looks out at the amazing city. In fact we started our stay with a trip to the spa. OMG this is one of the best massages I have ever had. The surroundings, music, scents, fixtures and staff. Honestly, you cannot improve on any element of the experience whatsoever. For anyone not familiar with the lounge experience, it’s worth it and will only enhance your experience. The Ritz-Carlton does it best. We have visited many lounges that try to emulate this, but they lack the staff. This is a glowing review I know, and for good reason. If and when…",5,October 2017,
The best hotel ever.,Joanne8866,"Thus is truly an amazing hotel. The rooms are huge; even the smallest is as big as a suite in any other hotel. The pool area, gym and associated spa are world class.

The view of the marina from the rooms is gorgeous. ",5,September 2017,
"Very luxurious, could have a little more personality",dtai2015,"Firstly, very very impressive hotel with beautiful lobby and beautiful cafe. The rooms are very large too especially given the super prime location. Those hexagonal bathroom windows never grow old. I'm still figuring out how they lighted the bedside tables - really cool. The food was very good too.   The only minor issue I had was that staff, while well trained, were a little too formal (if that's a thing..) When things got off the SOP some little cracks started showing. As an example, I asked for a pair of scissors - unusual request, and 20 minutes later I got slippers sent to my room.

A quite comfortable stay,Travelbird1111,"We stayed a weekend in August at the Ritz-Carlton and there is nothing really wrong with it, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype in my view. The room was spacious (for Singapore,) and tastefully decorated. There was ample storage room for luggage/clothes and a nice desk/sitting area in the room. Nice view too. The bathroom had lacking finish with silicone out of place and a half painted, unfinished ceiling, not what I expected at the Ritz. Also the bath products smelled like 'old lady' if you catch my drift. Not pleasant at all and I couldn't use them. The shower pressure was amazing though. The bed linens were very soft which is a huge plus for me as I travel with my own silk linens for comfort. (Didn't have to use them.) The service was good but a bit aloof, maybe we…",4,August 2017,

Go to hotel for grand prix,Businessman69,"The Ritz Carlton is in the thick of it for the Singapore GP weekend.  It would be hard to find a buzzier place on the planet for three hectic days, and then the caravan moves on!  The hotel copes with all tis very well, serving breakfast in two locations until about 2pm (so F1 people can remain on European time).  The bar at night after race or practice is also a fun place to be.  Having only ever stayed during race week, it's hard to comment on how the hotel performs at other times.  But my feeling is that if they can cope with GP week, everything else will seem easy.  Nice pool, adequate gym, and superb marina views.  Imperative to spend the money for a marina view.",5,September 2017,

She was amazed on how almost all of the staffs that we encountered during our stay are very friendly, helpful, energetic and accommodating. It was just an overnight stay, but overall what we had is exceptional and memorable.

We were seated by the window with a beautiful view of the Marina Bay, and served champagne. We helped ourselves to lunch while they did the check-in. We had a pleasant surprise when they upgraded us to a Club Marina Suite as we were celebrating our anniversary.   If you are considering staying here, it is throughly worth it to stay in a club room and better still one with the Marina view. The drinks and food served at the Club level and the wonderful view makes it all worthwhile. And the room with the Marina view, both day and night, is oh-so beautiful.   We enjoyed the pool as well as a walk to Gardens-by-the-Bay (just cross the main road and walk the Helix pedestrian bridge towards…",5,September 2017,
"Great service, beautiful rooms",Madloch4,"I love staying at the Ritz Carlton when I visit Singapore. If you can score a room with a view of the Marina Bay Sands, I would totally recommend it! The service at the hotel is great with everyone super helpful and friendly. The rooms are a good size and the bathrooms are also very nice. Breakfast is terrific with so many options. Sometimes the wait for a taxi can be a little long but it's very easy to get an Uber during peak times.",4,September 2017,
The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore is Fantastic! Ok,Grace P,"We have been staying at the Club Deluxe Suite and this is the best that my husband and I have stayed among other Ritz Carlton Hotels in Asia Pacific.    Our suite is approx. 750 sq.feet facing the Marina Bay which made us very relaxing during our stay. We were impressed with the service and facilities. The staff were friendly and attentive. The hotel fullfills the needs of customers in detail. For example, the lockers in pool changing room, besides providing the amenities that like other 5 stars hotels, there's even a dryer to dry your swimming suits and a plastic bag to carry them back to your room. There's also a jewellery box for you to keep your rings as well.    Complimentary drinks e.g. Cold drinks, Coffee and different kind of tea are served at lobby. Environment and…",5,September 2017,
Foreign Hair in the Shower !!!,BaJie1,Just arrived in Singapore and checked into this five-star hotel Club Deluxe Kallang room ...   I was about to take a shower as I was up 6 am this morning feeling exhausted; turned on the shower and couldn't help but notice a bunch of foreign hairs in the corner of our shower !!!!   Wow I would never expect this level of hygiene from any good hotel in Singapore not mentioning it is The Ritz-Carlton,1,September 2017,
Best Club Lounge !,sheila2909,"Spent a most enjoyable 5 days at Ritz Carlton. The club lounge here really is the best ever and nowhere else comes close !

Quality of Service do not match the Quality of Physical Location and Facilities,Fred C,"After many years of bieng the best hotel at the best location in Singpore, the quality of serive and the attitude of the staff are falling behind as the hotel fails to improve with time.   Fortunately, it still command the best location in town and has its captive audience..... I have been staying at this hotel for the last 20 years during my frequent business trip to Singapore.",3,September 2017,
Wonderful  service and quality,mimpmark,"We stayed for a brief break en route from Sydney to London. We chose the Ritz Carlton.   The hotel entirely met our expectations - it excels in the service and courtesy of its high quality staff, and the rooms are highly detailed, clean and quiet. Whilst the food in the Colony restaurant is a bit expensive, it is high quality, and there is great variety. The concierge team made  a great effort to provide useful information during our stay.   I noticed the staff remember names and details, even after only a brief contact, and numerous pleasant conversations ensued, which left us with very fond memories of Singapore, and its intelligent, successful and open culture.

Seriously wonderful meals,dickkingh,"Amazing trip and first stay at this hotel. The breakfasts, which are included in the room price, were at another level. Miss them!

Fantastic Hotel with Best in Class Service,Jamie B,"I stayed three nights at the SG Ritz-Carlton for business. From the moment of arrival all of the way through check-out the service was top notch. The room was very nice, view great, etc... But the differentiator from the dozens of other hotels in the area is the service which was by far above what I have experienced at similar hotels in SG. Look forward to staying again soon at the property.",5,September 2017,
Club Level,1020Alma,"Just  retuned from 5 night post cruise stay at Ritz Singapore Club Level.  My husband and I were treated like royalty.  The Club Level experience at this property is outstanding.  The staff not only takes care of each and every need, they anticipate it.  I probably spent more time in the Club Lounge than in my room.  Thank you to Sheila for treating me like family. Adora you are an angel! Lendl for my AM cappuccino and afternoon Riesling.  Katherine, you made our journey home smooth.  I wish I was on the 32nd floor with all of you right now. This is the only hotel in Singapore to stay at!!!! We will definitely be returning! David and Alma Thompson",5,September 2017,
fantastic,Martine C,"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia when Formula One was in town and the hotel was fully booked. I expected there would be small set backs because of the full occupation but this hotel is simply so good that everything was perfect as usual, inspite of the full occupation. The lobby bar is the local hub during F1 and everybody hangs out there, great service, good food and good ambiance. The rooms are spacious, very clean and comfortable with great amenities. The club lounge has exquisite bites and drinks with very professional staff assisting you with every single need you may have.  The hotel may be considered pricy - especially during F1 - but is definitely worth every dollar. I will stay there again.",5,September 2017,
Ritzcarlton but not honoring Ritzcarlton Rewards,trvlsoftend,"No loyalty program participation, very guarded hotel but very good management with right people at the service level.

Brunch,Missydee42,"My husband and I came here with some family as a wedding present to the Sunday Brunch. It was the most fabulous afternoon out. First off the champagne is included, if you go for the alcohol package, and they are very generous with it unlike a lot of other places. The service is amazing and every time you need a refill they are on hand to help. Now the food is out of this world. Being a fussy English woman there was such a variety of food that I managed to find plenty. The dauphinois potatoes were honesty the best I've ever had. The sweet selection at the end was fun and offered lots of variation. All in all it's an amazing day out and I would highly recommend visiting if your in Singapore on a Sunday. It's quite expensive but if you make the most of it it's great value for money!",5,September 2017,
As good as ever.,711matthewjamesc,"I've stayed at The Ritz-Carlton Singapore before and was happy find that this time around things were still at a very high standard.

Ritz-Carlton Millenia is second to none,Patricia H,"Ritz-Carlton Millenia takes customer service and quality control very seriously. This is evident from the moment of arrival to the time of departure. Staff are highly professional, warm and engaging. Rooms are beautifully appointed, impeccably clean and spacious. Club Lounge guests are treated to wonderfully varied food offerings throughout the day, and Club staff are always willing to go the extra mile to ensure their guests' needs are met. The Colony Sunday brunch is the best in Singapore, and maintains an excellent standard of service, variety and ambience. We love this hotel, and its staff, and return regularly.

Superb View on Level 32nd,The Weak Knee Traveler,Invited to have breakfast with a friend on 32nd floor. The spread was so so and not as good as that on level 3 which has a wider spread but the food was ok. What stood out was the superb view of the bayfront.,4,September 2017,
luxury and position,Sailingtragic,a fantastic central position where you can walk everywhere  the room had fantastic views and the pool was a great meeting point each day  he hotel is not cheap but well worth the cost  the rooms were probably the best nights sleep we have ad in five weeks away  i would reccomend a stay if only for the bed and the view from  the bedroom,5,August 2017,

The actual high tea was perfect - yummy food and lots of choices for drinks.  However what made the experience memorable was the service - the staff were fantastic.

Excellent Hotel!,briantE2664MC,"This is my second time staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore this year, and the experience was very positive.  The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  They have full service and amenities.  The pool is very large and big enough for business folks wanting to swim laps and families with kids to enjoy.  I wish there was an outdoor  Jacuzzi at the pool as the only ones they have are in the spa area.  I only ate at the buffet for breakfast and a few dinners.  The food and service was outstanding.",5,September 2017,

I was greeted by Matthew who greeted me by name as soon as I got out of the taxi and I was taken to the club lounge for my check in and could check in to my room straight away which was 930 am.  I went out for a couple of hours and came back to a birthday cake and fruit and pastries in my room xxx. That was so sweet. The views of the city were so fabulous especially at night. The view from the dining room was of the marina so you got to see all the lights of the gardens by the bay and the marina.  Ami was so helpful on the front desk and even let us have a late check out at 6pm as we had a late flight which was so amazing, we were only hoping for 2pm so it was a great surprise.

Overall extremely pleased with the service, room, amenities and location. Check in was a bit slow, but the service from our checkin executive Douglas Heng was excellent. We had a smooth change of rooms initially and he sent us a box of chocolates in the middle of our stay with a note to ensure that we're enjoying our stay. Rooms and bathrooms are huge and luxurious, bed is pretty comfortable. My room air con wasn't cold enough so they sent a technician immediately to adjust the thermostat hidden in the false ceiling of the room. View of the Kallang basin was fabulous.

honeymoon travel,ssurila,WOW!! From the moment you pull into the entrance you a greeted by the most polite and professional staff. They are the true highlight of the visit. I don't know if they are required to ask questions and help you figure out the best tourist locations but they do!!! Then the manager on duty found out we were there for our honeymoon and sent over delicious desserts complimentary!! The staff is amazing and the amenities are endless!! The breakfast and lunch are delicious!! They provide so many options!!! If your in Singapore there is no better place to stay!!! We thought about Marina Bay when initially booking our honeymoon but trust me the Ritz Carlton is a far better choice! The only hotel I want to ever stay at!,5,September 2017,
Amazing stay thank you,karen1403,"At last, a hotel who understands the meaning of the word service.   They simply could not do enough for us. Eva at the pool bar was lovely and even came to rescue me with an umbrella during a rather sudden downpour.  Something to be aware of though is tax is added to food/room service/spa etc. nothing major but caught us a bit unawares when we checked out.  The pool is stunning, comfortable sofas and cabanas all free to use. Staff are great forever bringing clean towels and lemon infused water over. Pool is huge with lots of space and classical music piped through to help you relax.  Gym is very reasonable in size and choice of equipment. Again staff are great bringing chilled towels over when you need them most!   This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at and will visit…",5,September 2017,

Amazing views. Great choice for stay in Singapore,Jaejae,"I have to say that although my initial arrival was less than great, I left impressed and very happy. Evan Chiang (manager?) was more than helpful in getting my issue sorted out and he handled everything with ease and finesse. Without him, I don't think my stay would have been as nice as it was.  The views from the room speak for themselves- I really can't imagine having a more picturesque view. The bed is very comfortable, room is very nice with floor to ceiling windows and automatic blinds and shades. Lots of elevators so you don't need to wait. Bellman and front desk staff are friendly and sincere. Club lounge staff are always asking if there is anything you need (or want?) and seem to be eager to please.    I thought it was a little odd that minibar had pepsi products instead…",5,September 2017,

Perfect location for a relaxing getaway,TravelQT88,The location of The Ritz is at a great location; definitely go for the marina bay view!  It's view are spectacular during day or night.  Everything about the hotel exudes elegance.  The bed is super comfy and all amenities you need for a comfortable stay.   The reason for the four stars is because the room that I originally booked was for a club room with Marina bay views.  But they checked us in a room that was facing the back. So imagine the hassle having to go back to the front desk and bring up the mistake and wait for associate to locate the correct room view; all this while I'm still daze from the long long flight getting in almost midnight.  I don't think it's acceptable for a hotel such as The Ritz to make such a mistake.,4,August 2017,
Amazing views BUT breakfast needs to be improved,bambasydney,"I have to say I am very impressed by this hotel. The rooms are superb, very comfortable and the pool are, gym and bar are fantastic. Location is good with access to a mall directly from the hotel so all in all really good. What I found a real let down was the breakfast area. It very confusing, The fodd areas are all different little corners and  food groups are not arrange together in logical way. It was a really confusing and frustrating experience due to the flow. The quality of teh food is absolutely superb so no issue there just the organsiation.",4,September 2017,

Fantastic Breakfast,GenieBeanie--a,"I've always enjoyed staying at this Ritz.  Time and time again, I find the breakfast spread to be impressive in its assortment and quality.

We stayed in a Marina Club room which had a king size bed and a wonderful day bed that was great to sit or lie on and relax and take in the views. The bathroom is huge and well appointed with separate toilet. There is even views from the bathroom. The staff at the hotel make your stay memorable. I mentioned it was my husbands birthday and they had a lovely cake waiting for him and made the point of wishing him Happy Birthday. The definite highlight for us was the Club room.

5* dining experience at Colony Restaurant,Kristen,"The unsung star of Colony restaurant is Rethish (Raj). Despite my last 2 visits being in Dec 2014, he remembers details of my previous visits & created a 5* dining experience befitting of the Ritz-Carlton brand name.  Unsurprising that his team members praise his management abilities & kind personality, which pulled a seamless service from a team that's proud to be under him.

As frequent five star luxury travelers I am judging with a deeper view. Also myself I have been working for Ritz Carlton in the past and therefore I can always recommend Ritz Carlton hotels :).   The arrival was nice but not as warm as usual. The check in took a while and we were offered a welcome drink in the meanwhile. The room was a high floor, facing the marina. AMAZING!! The hotel room itself old, but everything fine. Nice bathtub also with city view :).   Club floor: very nice staff. Again stunning view over the marina bay.

The room was more than beautiful. Perfectly clean and comfortable.  And the view from both the room and the bathroom... unforgettable.

It's a luxury hotel with excellent room service and prompt attention from the servicing staff to the Banquet Operations Manager.

The buffet breakfast was superb with a wide range of varieties from Asian, Indian, Tim Sum and more.  I saw the kids were delighted to have ice cream before ending their breakfast. The stay was very welcoming and indeed pleasurable.",5,August 2017,
Less vegetarian options,Maisha C,"The hotel was amazing in every aspect other than the food options.

Ritz Carlton is not that crowded, which is pretty important to us, lead us quiet and comfortable stay. The staff here were extremely warm and patient, easy to communicate. Many of them could speak Chinese. Our room is the Grand Marina, a great room with a King bed and a large soft daybed. We can enjoy the great view of Marina Bay on the bed, and bathtub faces CBD of the city. It's easy to take the panorama in the room even if the windows were pretty dirty. However, the hotel did have some disadvantages. It's a pretty low-level building around the Marina Bay, only 32 floors to the top.

Simply Awesome !,Nish9para,During the ICC (Football) tournament we booked this Hotel. Later we found out that one of the clubs Chelsea was also staying here. The staff was very nice & helpful. The rooms are pretty big & bathroom in particular gives breathtaking views of Singapore Skyline. The food inside the hotel is little bit expensive if compared to Singapore average but then its Ritz Carlton brand. The swimming pool was superb as well and Gym is not that big but pretty sufficient. Location wise its perfectly located in the heart of Singapore City and you can sea the Marina bay sands. All & all one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. Special mention the Deputy Concierge 'Adam' that guy is a legend.,5,July 2017,
"Perfect, great installations!",ElioWolff,"Stayed in the hotel in a business trip. The hotel is very well located, close to several business centers. The gym is excellent, with new equipment. The pool seems quite nice as well, although I have not used. Breakfast is complete with full variety. The check-in and check-out is a bit slow and could improve, mind also the time to obtain a taxi as on peak hours it could require some minutes waiting. Also found the food at the hotel overpriced, sparkling waters & drinks very expensive as well. All in all, very good hotel to stay, recommend.",4,July 2017,

Very disappointing,doritg888,"We had a business breakfast w 42 people and it was appealing how bad the service was.  Firstly it took ages that all 42 guest had breakfast , should have been more coordinated. Jam and butter on the table but no bread served at all. Coffee was served after the breakfast was done! No milk on the table. Clearly I would suggest the Ritz Carlton can do better than this. ",2,August 2017,
Do not recommend stay on special public holidays,laurynt2016,"Recommended not to plan your stay there when there is special occasion (e.g. National Day, Christmas Day, etc). Room assigned most likely will not be the one you want. Due to the high demand for housekeeping and front desk services, be prepared to wait for a while before getting attended.",3,August 2017,
Wonderful stay,courtneyryang,"Stayed at the Ritz while on business travel.  The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable.  I've stayed at several hotels in Singapore, including one very nice hotel on Sentosa, and I feel that the Ritz is the nicest place I've stayed.  The location is within a short walk of a variety of different restaurants as well as an MRT station.",5,August 2017,

As we stepped out of our car, were greeted by the valet staff and another hotel staff, Syahirah. She welcomed us warmly and brought us to the check-in counter. Good reception from her. Felt very welcomed.   We were checked-in by Alexis. Another accommodating and friendly staff. As we arrived earlier than expected, we were assured that she will try to get a room with a good view of the National Day Parade. And yes, the view was awesome!

Average luxury hotel,CptSlag,"First time in Singapore. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton for 2 nights on our cross Asia honeymoon. Our deluxe marina view room was very nice. It had a very large bedroom and bathroom. The view was even more spectacular!  Amenities were fine. Food and drinks were pricey as expected, but they did have a great $12 sgd gin and tonic selection (although it was not available at the pool). The hotel is close to the MRT, which was great for exploring the city. However it would have been nice if the hotel had a back entrance so one would not have to walk out front and around in the extremely hot weather to reach the station. The mall behind the hotel conveniently had a Starbucks. Hotel was quiet at night and staff very helpful.  The person checking us in mentioned they would do something…",3,August 2017,

From the moment we arrived, from the doormen to the check-in staff everyone was extremely smiley and friendly. We had stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel the previous night (mainly for the infinity pool) and the Ritz Carlton is so so much better in comparison. RC is much classier while MBS felt like a zoo.   The main highlight of our stay was Ariel, one of the RC staff who greeted us from the moment we walked in, chatted with us, helped us find the nearest Bak KutTeh shop even though it wasn't even her responsibility to do so. We told her we wanted to stay at RC for the window view and that we were wondering whether there's a florist nearby we could get rose petals from so we could take photos. She told us that she can do that for us…",5,July 2017,
National day staycation,Lin_Sg,"Awesome view of the floating platform. Close enough to view the NDP.

Also in room I-pad helped me to book a cab and request staff for luggage assistance.   Th outdoor pool was small and too cold to play with a little boy. They dont have a kids pool. Its very cozy place to take a short break. However I don' want to recommend the pool for toddlers. Tooooo cold water.

Birthday dinner,Fiona L,"Our children bought us dinner here for our birthdays, so I have no idea on the cost. The food was wonderful, I will forever remember the sashimi which was wonderful.

Also they gave us (2) complimentary personalized birthday cakes; delicious dark chocolate mousse cakes. A fantastic memory!",4,August 2017,
Awesome stay,PayalBanerjee,Stayed here a number of times last year and this year while on business trips - easily one of the best hotels in the area.  The views from their premier rooms are to die for. Just couldn't get enough of it. And incredibly distracting when you're trying to work. :) The rooms are luxurious and they keep it clean to the point of being obsessive about it. :)  Service is super prompt and the staff really helpful. The location makes it really sought after. You can walk to Marina Bay Sands through this lovely promenade in literally 10 minutes!   On most occasions their food is good too. They have a lovely bakery. And their breakfast spread at Colony was quite impressive.   They have a great spa as well. Got the deep tissue massage - and it was a god send after this incredibly stressful…,4,February 2017,

Fantastic Stay,David W,"We recently stayed at the Ritz in the lead up to the annual pride day. Although our room didn't overlook the bay, we had access to the top level club lounge which did. I'm so glad we took up that option because it meant that we had our own private viewing platform to watch the dress rehearsal with the fighter jets and festivities going on over the bay. The famous Ritz hospitality certainly was in full force while we were there with several staff giving us their personal number and email to call for 'anything'. On our final night one of the staff (wish I could remember her name) took a photo of us with the fireworks in the background. While we were checking out she gave us a gift of the photo framed in a gift box. What an amazing thought!!  Definitely try out the colony lunch…",5,July 2017,

Michelin Star Restaurant & Spa,Adeline L,"Allow me to begin by saying that I am not the fancy restaurant or spa types but since it was my birthday, my Daughter planned a day of pampering at the hotel's Summer Pavilion Restaurant and Hotel Spa for me. The restaurant deserves more than a star for the service alone and I was looked after  throughout by Kelvin who introduced every dish and even noticed when I didn't touch much of their Cheong fun, asking if he could take it off my bill if it wasn't too my liking and what was missing in the dish. I was simply too full!

The breakfast experience is good although the area so cluttered it's hard to move around and find what you want.

Don't bother,935lyndseye,"The Ritz was really disappointing on my second visit there.

Not a great hotel for the price paid,mrnothersan,"We stayed at the Ritz Carlton Singapore as we were on our way to New Zealand, so we used it as a transit hotel.  The reception area was nice and the staff were very friendly. However, the room wasn't up to expectations unfortunately. It was quite dated and there was damage to some of the furniture in the room. It was also quite noisy. We enquired about moving to another room (due to the noise from outside) however the hotel didn't have any other suitable rooms available that had 2 separate beds. For the price paid, it wasn't a great stay.  I wouldn't stay here again unfortunately, which is a shame, as the staff were fantastic but the room wasn't good unfortunately.",3,April 2017,

We were able to watch the fireworks from our bedroom.   The Asprey collection was part of the amenities provided.   The staffs were all courteous and friendly.

Ritz-Carlton Singapore,Ritz,"Service was inconsistent and at times failing expectations. I suspect this is due to the high turn over rate and 6 month employment of interns.

The understated elegance, personal service and luxury won me over. The food was superb and the room was perfect in every way. No gimmicks, just luxury and comfort.  The views of the Marina Bay complex blew us away.  The only gripe: the pool was being renovated so no pool, hence our decision to go to W in Sentosa for the second half of our singapore stopover. Kids club was also a work in progress. Also booked late so missed out on getting the much sought after new years eve booking on way back. I loved this hotel. Will definitely return.",5,December 2016,
One of the perfect experience in Ritz Carlton,junyungc2017,I am really enjoyed my stay in Ritz Carlton Singapore. The Ritz Carlton provided an excellent service quality. This is one of the best experience for my stay in The Ritz Carlton hotel group in my life.,5,July 2017,
Probably the best hotel in Singapore,Roddy G,"Our recent stay at the Ritz Carlton in Singapore was initially planned as a nice stop off for a couple of days on our way back from 5 weeks in New Zealand. Our enjoyment of the beautiful city of Singapore but more especially the simply wonderful staff and surroundings of the Ritz Carlton made our visit a hugely memorable experience. The hotel is without doubt one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. If visiting Singapore make sure that you stay there, you will not be dissapointed.",5,July 2017,
One fine Singapore icon,DonCharl,This is an iconic hotel. A little dated but perfectly maintained.  Luxury and comfort in perfect balance.  The best part is the location and price. Perfect for the business traveler or family vacation.  Don't do the Marina Bay Sands thing. It's overrated and overpriced. You can go take a look but don't stay there. This is where you want to be. Hope they start a new remodel soon to keep the rooms current but you can hardly go wrong with a stay here.,5,July 2017,
Best view in town,tomashusek,"We booked a Marina bay view suite and it was wow style! Children got their own safari tent within the room including night lamps! Bathroom view is unmatched, perhaps only if Mt. Everest was behing, than it would be better. The hotel is imposing building and staff anticipate everything you need. We were leaving early morning we skipped the breakfast, yet when they saw us they immediately brught small snacks. I think they knew in advance that we were looking for Suntec bus terminal and showed us ""secret way"" through the hotel etc. Best views of Singapore must be from this hotel. Night sky or daytime, it is magnificient and location is nearby to everything.  I must mention breakfast. We spent already more than 400 nights in RC´s around the world and this one has the best breakfast.…",5,July 2017,
Still one of the best staycation!,Jade L,"Celebrated Anniversaries and Birthday at this hotel before. Over the years, still find the rooms well maintained. Spacious, very comfy beds, beautiful bathrooms with great views. Good variety of dining options since is located near to malls. We tried the buffet dinner at Colony (within hotel). Though is pricey, they do include choices of freshly shucked oysters, nicely done grilled lobster, well cut sashimi, tasty and decent size chilli crab, beautiful selection of quality chocolates, fruit juices etc. ",5,July 2017,
"Great Location, Magnificent Views Over Marina Bay!",TravelWriter7,"Our stay at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia involved a family trip to Singapore. We found this hotel to be ideally situated in the Marina Bay Area with easy access to the Botanical Gardens, the Marina Bay Sands Complex and the downtown financial center. In addition, the MRT station is a short walk, 3 blocks away for access all across Singapore. We chose Club Level rooms and the panoramic views over Marina Bay are breathtaking. Rooms are modern and well-appointed, with electronic window shades and light dimming features that could make a home-techie jealous. The Club Level restaurant amenities are well worth it, with delicious buffets, an automated wine bar, and chef service for personalized dishes. The concierge service here is top-notch and knowledgable, very willing to help you…",5,June 2017,
A day of luxury,311brittl,"This was a 28 hour stopover in Singapore on our way from Europe to Sydney  and we thoroughly enjoyed the luxury of the Ritz Carlton.

Ritz-Carlton Club Lounge Experience,A8261FJdennist,The Room: Room and view was amazing with exceptionally good room service. The hotel were good enough to upgrade us to a suite room with fantastic view of the marina bay. The staffs at the check in were very polite and friendly and gave us good service.  The Club Lounge experience compared with other hotels: No complimentary buffet breakfast at colony No complimentary non-alcoholic beverages from the in-room mini bar and if you are a person who loves food together with the nice view then ritz will be a disappointment. The food quality and variety was very poor and ranks the lowest in all the club lounges we have been.The club lounge service was also below expectation.  We hope ritz will improve this as well,3,July 2017,
Fantabulous 1st Birthday Celebration!,kkhung,"We booked a premier suite stay under the Ritz Kids Night Safari Adventures promotion to celebrate our younger boy's 1st birthday and we truly had a memorable and fantabulous time during our stay at Ritz Carlton!!  We would like thank Rebecca and Joy for arranging so many surprises to make this birthday celebration a special one; from the balloon decorations and presents to the thoughtfully handwritten birthday cards and beautiful family photo for our keepsake. Thank you for personally visiting us to wish the little boy happy birthday! The kids had a blast and both of you have certainly made our stay a memorable one. 😄  Special thanks to Kelly too, for giving us such a warm welcome when we arrived at the hotel and Kathleen, for making the check-in and check-out such a breeze.…",5,July 2017,
A true six-star experience,MarthaNovak,"I could not think of going to Singapore without staying at the Ritz Carlton Millenia. It encapsulates the modernity of Singapore, its traditions and the meeting of cultures. It is, too, like a museum, from the building perforated by a mighty circle, to the rooms with huge hexagonal windows to the bay, to the Chihuli lighting arrangements, to the food. The service is second to none. The attention to detail is uncanny. I have always felt special there. Life is wonderful, it is a pleasure to the senses. Don't miss the pool with a waterfall fountain or the room service. They even made personalised visiting cards for us for longer stays. The best, trust me. If you like the good life, you will love this hotel.",5,May 2017,

I arrived on after an early morning flight and was shown to the spa to freshen up and relax while a room became available, which was a great way to start my stay, I was lucky enough to be on the 32nd club floor , and the all day restaurant makes for a very relaxing stay as breakfast is only a short walk along the corridor, with the most amazing views.",5,June 2017,

Stunning views and excellent service,Oliver L,"Had a fantastic stay here during a trip to Singapore. I booked a standard club-level room and was upgraded to a Marina Bay view room thanks to Virtuoso, which offers confirmed upgrades at booking for this particular property. The standout feature was of course the panoramic views of Marina Bay, but the room itself was nice and spacious, with contemporary decor, a large desk, and a comfortable daybed that was perfect for lounging. The hotel has done a good job in keeping their technology up to date, with bedside controls for the curtains and lights, in addition to conveniently-placed universal power outlets. The bathroom was nice as well, with Asprey toiletries, a walk-in rain shower, marble vanity, and soaking tub right next to a window overlooking the bay.  The 32nd floor club…",5,November 2016,
Putting Off The Ritz,DScotty,"Come to the Ritz-Carlton for great views of Marina Bay, otherwise stay away. Hotel management is aloof, if not clueless, about customer service or loyalty. He just emailed me about my concerns 5 days after checkout, and then only because I gave them low scores on their hotel survey. I booked 11 nights, checked out after just 1.   Warning to Marriott Rewards Members: No Marriott points, upgrades, club, etc. despite bookable on Marriott website. Nowhere was lack of Rewards listed online or in email confirmation. Only found out at check in. Inexcusable not to notify at time of and after booking.   Hotel is old and needs serious rennovations, especially for rates charged. A/C could not cool below 21C.

"Excellent location, beautiful hotel",Wainnnnn,"This review is long overdue since I'd stayed in October last year. But I still remember the beautiful memories my bf and I created in Ritz Carlton for his birthday.   We didn't manage to get a room until 4 p.m and frankly I was annoyed because it was Ritz Carlton and I had a very high expectation for their management. But fortunately, everything was great again when the Assistant Manager compensated us with a late check out the next day and Champagne for my bf's birthday. It made up the unhappiness and the time wasted in the lobby doing nothing and waiting for the room.   So, safe to say that you'd never go wrong choosing Ritz Carlton as a place to celebrate special occasions because they do take your celebrations seriously!   We stayed in One Bedroom Millennial Suite and I…",5,October 2016,

Everything in this hotel is top. From staff to food to gym to hotel room. Great running tracks in the early morning if you can deal with heat/humidity. If not, there are tons of treadmills in the gym. The pool opens early in the morning allowing you to cool down after the workout.   The package is top, top, top. Free WiFi and great location are a bonus to an already convincing offering. We have seen many family meetings, weddings etc. It seems that the Ritz-Carlton is not only top for business trips but in general caters for many different occasions.  The Ritz-Carlton and Singapore are a combination hard to beat.",5,June 2017,

The pool is really nice and helps wash away an 8 hour flight. The breakfast is probably/unquestionably THE best breakfast of our lives!

Could've Accommodated Better,morgspecht,The staff and hotel was absolutely amazing. Beautiful area and even more beautiful rooms and hotel lounging areas. But the only problem we had was checking in to our room. Our plane got in at 5 AM and of course we knew we wouldn't be able to check in to the room at that time. The front desk staff knew of our dilemma but continued to clean other vacant rooms first. It would've been nice if they could've put our premium suite on priority so we could get in as soon as the previous guests checked out. At $800 a night they should've been able to help out and be a little more concerned with our situation.,3,June 2017,

Great place,Michele489,"I really enjoyed the experience. A very beautiful hotel, with great service. And yet I hade two issues. First, I hit the pool's wall one morning while swimming. True, it was dark. True, my eyesight is less than perfect. However, a white sign at the top of the lane would help anybody realize that the border is near. The other issue is that I had a problem every night in turning the tv off (and I couldn't understand why the tv would turn itself on automatically upon opening the room's door). It took a good 5 minutes and on two occasions I had to call the hotel's engineer. Other than that, a ver pleasant stay.",5,June 2017,

The location is just perfect. Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion Park are just 5 minutes walking distance away. You will find the Esplanade Mall and the Millenia Mall also nearby.

The view is great and the experience from checking in till the friendly service staffs in the pool was excellent.   What impressed me was the wide range of free movies available. The shows are recently on screen and there are a few blockbusters I have yet to catch.  These free movies should be available in all the 5 star hotels as an additional pull factor for family enjoyment within the hotel.",4,April 2017,
"Nice Hotel, but...",db9x,"We came here for a weekend trip together early May, both of our first time in Singapore. Stayed 2 nights here and we got a room with a very beautiful view and access to the Club Lounge.  The room was very beautiful and spotless. The greeters in the front door, front desk, the cooks in the Club Lounge, and the bartender in the lobby lounge are very helpful and friendly, even the housekeeper who cleaned our room was very polite and full with a smile tho we only met her couple of minutes. The hotel is very close to Marina Bay Sands, casino, malls, museums & art galleries. very convenient to go around in walking distance.  I don't know why, but the girls in the Club Lounge seems careless to me (only to me), sometimes even gave a gesture that I didn't exist when they talked to my…",3,May 2017,
Fantastic Hotel on the Water in Singapore,bayrider,We checked in the hotel and was very happy to be assisted to our room by a personal butler.  The room had a fantastic view of the bay and especially from the bathroom.  The attendant recommend that the windows were transparent both ways so to avoid leakage to be clothed when in the bath!:-)   The lounge in the Ritz is very expensive.  It comes out to be around $160/day just for lounge privileges.  This Ritz albeit will honor some privileges of Platinum Ritz members they do not comp you for the lounge so you have to pay out of pocket to get lounge privileges.  I think it's worth it for 1 day just to experience the level of service at this Ritz since they have 5 meals a day served at the lounge! and all the champagne you could drink.    The restaurant buffet is also wonderful and…,5,April 2017,
Short stay in Singapore,Duncan W,My wife and I met up in Singapore for a few days when she had been with family in the U.K. Short taxi ride from Changi and the hotel is well situated on the Marina. Walking distance to Gardens by the bay and large shopping centres just at the back of the hotel. Nearby hawker centre also good for cheap al Fresno meals.. Rooms and service were excellent with a comprehensive buffet breakfast of extremely high standard. . We had a great few days here and really enjoyed coming back to the hotel after a day out for a swim in the pool before dinner.,5,June 2017,

Hotel with the best view in Singapore,Ricky S,"What can I say? Well I found the perfect hotel for me and my little family. First, we don't really like crowded area such as Orchard , so we find that the location of the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore is perfect. While it's not too crowded but we could enjoy lots of tourist attraction in walking distance such as the Merlion, Marina Square, Suntec City, Art and Science Museum, The Shoppe and Garden by The Bay.  Second, for me, this hotel offers rooms with the best view in town. Request for a room with Marina Bay view and voila, you'll be amazed . Third, this hotel is a very child friendly. From a baby car seat request during the Airport Pick Up, Baby Stroller, Humidifier, Sterilizer, you name it and they have it. Really helpful since we don't have to pack a lot of baby…",5,June 2017,

Great service and location!,momto2princesses,"We stayed here for two nights on our way to the Maldives.  We wanted to spend some time exploring the beautiful city of Singapore and the Ritz has a great location.  We stayed in a suite on the 8th floor and had a wonderful city view from all rooms.

Our Dreaming Wedding @ Ritz-Carlton,TUSN1826,"Ritz Carlton Singapore gave us a wonderful wedding. The room was decorated for us specially. The room is awesome! During the 2 days stay, the room service staffs were all very kind and helpful. Ms Sharon and her team helped us with many of the details for our wedding. During the wedding dinner, the banquet managers Mr shaik and Mr Ken also helped us a lot to make sure whole event is smoothly. The ballroom and table setting are elegant.

One of the best,alexfurgeson,"I've stayed here several times and it really is a world class Five Star Property in every regard.  It is honestly difficult to fault this hotel, from the service to the rooms, to the food they pretty much have it nailed down.  The only down side I suppose is the cost, but then again it is competitive in this bracket so I never complain.  I would recommend getting a club room - the club lounge is a great amenity.",5,April 2017,

Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore,margotc470,"Beautiful hotel with exceptional staff, all around.  Favorite experience was in the Chihuly Lounge for breakfast each morning!

very classic with fabulous view,Lauren B,this hotel is well known for its marvelous view overlooking the marina bay sands hotel. the city's night view is just amazing. breakfast was extraordinary with more-than-average no. of variation of food. ritz carlton hopes to engage an environment-friendly bedding so the sheets would be changed every other day unless requested otherwise. the staff were extremely kind and willing to offer help.

They are maintaining the quality expected,Peter Iancov,"This is a good hotel, well designed and with plenty of good restaurants and health facilities. In a typical Ritz style, there is an abundance of glamour and special art everywhere.   If you like to be over serviced this is the place for you. For one, this is the bit that I don't like .... having people fuss about trying to help with luggage that I can carry and be overly friendly at every step.   The spa, gym and pool facilities are outstanding. The service by the pool .... could improve. Not sure why waiters feel ashamed to take notes when the order is longer. Invariably they forget stuff or bring the wrong order.... for a 5 star hotel this is likely unacceptable.   Walking distance to Marina Bay Sands, Art Science Museum, Fullerton Hotel and many restaurants. Nevertheless, not…",5,June 2017,
excellent hotel in the prime location,josephined474,"I've been staying in this hotel for several times, the services always satisfied me. Starting from the first time you entered the hotel, the staffs are helpful and friendly, the check-in process also fast, and because I came earlier so the room wasn't ready yet, I went for a walk, then they sent you text that the room is available so what I have to do is just ask for the key, and my lluggages already in the room, and surprisingly they prepared welcoming cookies and chocolates in the room.that's a pleasant surprise! All the staffs are friendly and helpful, once I need to go to mart and it's already midnight, I asked the way out to the lady who do the cleaning in the lady's room, she not just told me the way, but she walked me too! that""s really really a very meaningful for me!",5,May 2017,
Conference venue,Paula A,"The ballroom was big enough to accommodate us all. The hotel ammenities (pen,paper, water,mints) was nice. Although sometimes they ran out of pen and mints. Would be great if they provided chocolates like those found at the room.   Lunch and morning and afternoon tea breaks were okay. I was looking forward for some kachang, bengali sweets, laksa, mantou and chili crab, and hainanese chicken but sadly they didnt serve it.  Room ammenities were okay. Loved the view from the window. Beds were comfy but room was kinda small.",3,June 2017,

Fancy and superb stay,KohRyan,Stayed in my home town in the Riz Carlton some months ago the first time and I loved it. I sum up some of my points:  Service - I walked through the door and got welcomed from the beginning - They showed me the room privately and explained everything - Even I live in Singapore for a long time they could explain me some new facts about marina bay - Staff is extremely friendly  Room - awesome view to the marina bay - lovely bath - good beds  Breakfast  - great variety of food - good quality - good cappuccino  Location - close to marina bay - nice shopping around there - awesome pool  Summary: I would definitely recommend this hotel to other people,5,November 2016,

Top end Service and great views!,rupakk6,Stayed for three nights in May of 2017. Service was top notch and any hiccup was handled quickly and efficiently. Rooms are large with the higher floor rooms having incredible views of the city. Housekeeping needs a special mention. They were the best! Beds were extremely comfortable.  We were very sweetly given a small bottle of Moet and some snacks with a lovely note from a staff member ( I forget her name! Apologies! )  It was a lovely touch so the whole Ritz experience was wonderful.,5,May 2017,

雖然酒店ok~但我卻有點失望！,Iceland6660,先講酒店先: 交通方便約5至10分鐘便到MRT，我住的房間唔係對摩天輪所以到晚上是Dark of the view! 想睇景可以到lift口，因為lift口係對金沙，個景好靚! 左邊行去金沙路程約15至20分鐘，右邊行去無招牌約20分鐘。酒店早餐好正！有我最鍾意既Ham👍🏻  再講服務...我的確有點失望，我係透過旅行社book酒店，亦已自行半個月前send email比酒店。原因我已表示同未婚夫以及未婚夫家人同行，想安排得更妥當！ 首先因爲原本係住一晚的，所以book左2D1N x 2Rooms，但其後商量完決定再住多一晚，所以我分別再訂。Email中已表明要求不更換房間，希望同住一層。 當我1點check in時話我知Peak Season要3點後才有房，而且未必安排到同一層，完全令我心情立即跌到低點！我話我唔係要而家有房，我要求係同一層！同不換房！當我10點回到酒店時，的確安排同一層。但到第2日我晚上9點幾返到酒店條key被lock，要去大堂用passport再access! 簡直係ridiculous！所以我之後已完全無心情用呢間酒店既設施！ 我完全唔明點解會lock左我地2間房張房卡？！ 無early check in / 無late check out / 無high floor /  無connecting room 以上呢啲提供唔到我都唔會唔高興，只係我無其他人幸運。不怪誰。 但要求唔換房但lock我張卡!!!! So disappointed!!!,4,May 2017,

Memorable Two night Wedding Anniversary stay,Tony M,"Unforgettable stay at this magnificent establishment!  From the moment you enter you are greeted by highly professional, friendly staff (they all have earpieces so that they can communicate presumably).  My wife and I spent two nights here en route to the Maldives.  At check in, there was some mix up with our booking - not the managements fault as it turned out - we made the booking through Amex and there was some confusion.  We were invited to the bar/lounge for complementary drinks where we waited in comfort while the issue was sorted.  Although we waited around an hour, we didn't mind because I arranged to meet a colleague of mine who'd recently moved to Singapore and was working nearby.

One of the better places in town,Navigaytion,"This is THE place to stay. Forget the pool at the nearby hotel, thats all you get! At RC you get personal attention rather than feel like a number. They have a very nice spa and pool, gym and exercise areas. The buffet is high quality and the afternoon tea is good too.   Rooms with a bay view are one more reason you stay at this place but club access will top off your stay with high quality and varied foods throughout the day. You also get free alcohol, cocktails, wines... and if you know this city you know that is a great advantage ;) Everyone was lovely but I did have a couple of issues, one of which may have been my own doing but the other contention was definitely their bad.

Chihuly lounge,Mano V,"I was at the Chihuly lounge today. It's my first time staying at the Ritz and visiting this lounge. I must say the lounge is very nice with a great ambience. The service level here is equally as great. I was served by a Miss Tia from Seoul, Korea. She was very attentive and took care of my needs such as keeping my ohone fully charged when she realised that I was in need of a charger. She also made sure that I had a light dinner meal since I had to do some work here. It's this type of service that will always make the Ritz Carlton brand among the best globally..

We were instantly upgraded to a room on the 30th floor with a gorgeous view of the city and bay.

The restaurant was fully booked but despite that we did not notice any stress with the staff. Very nice layout and presentation of all dishes. It would take too long to into food details. You have to trust us when we say that you could find EVERYTHING related to Christmas food and desserts.  We have previously eaten Christmas Buffets at other establishments in Singapore.

The choice is phenomenal and great gluten free options. The newly redesigned pool area and spa are beautiful. A total oasis of calm and luxury - this hotel has it all. Well positioned for the MBS convention centre and Singapore sightseeing. The perfect hotel and one you will never get tired of visiting !,5,May 2017,
Nearly perfect stay,volkermtl,The only two aspects to criticise here are that if you arrive after 10:30 pm there is nothing more to eat. Restaurants closes at 10:30 and roomservice kitchen at 11:00 pm.  Technical equipment could be updated.,5,May 2017,
シンガポールの中でも最高クラスのホテル,DonFree1980,"I went to Singapore for business and leisure. From check-in to check-out, I could stay very comfortable.

Ritz-Carlton Millenia,norikot102,I stayed for 4 days from 5th May to 8th May. Breakfast at COLONY is always delicious Champagne branch with friends also has a great time to have fun I was able to spend it! Darren responded with nice timing His smile was also good.  The spa could be used after checkout It is saved in high humidity Singapore. The mist sauna feels good.  It was a great answer to choose the Ritz-Carlton Millenia. I want to stay at the next time. Thank you.,5,May 2017,

Wedding at Garden Pavilion 6.5.17 ( Best Wedding Ever!),Bryan L,"We held our wedding at Ritz Carlton’s Garden Pavilion on 6 May 2017 and our experience was nothing short of extraordinary. Our wedding coordinator, Sharon, and her team were faultless throughout the wedding planning process, and on the actual day as well.  Sharon was incredibly helpful every step of the way, and always made sure she went over and beyond her call of duty. We initially had our reservations about the venue as we had some handicapped guests, but Ritz not only assigned dedicated staff to these individuals, but they also converted one of the function rooms into a rest area (complete with partitions and a bed) so our handicapped guests could be brought there to rest anytime during the dinner.  As the wedding couple, we were assigned staff who took care of our every…",5,May 2017,

Great Hotel,Roy K,"When arriving at the hotel, we were swiftly escorted to reception for a speedy check-in. We had asked for connecting rooms with our kids but these were not available in the room type we had booked. No problem - the upgrade fee was waived and we were shown to our 9th floor rooms.   They were fabulous. Spacious with great views over Marina Bay - absolutely stunning. The bathroom was spacious - and we certainly had a bath with a view. The beds were king size and comfortable, pillows may have been a little soft. Toiletries were nice in the bathroom, although I do agree with others that the showers were difficult to control. Boiling hot or freezing cold with little in between.  Breakfast was fabulous - the largest selection I think I have ever seen anywhere. They had absolutely…",5,May 2017,

Worth the price for club access,DMSMD64,"We stayed for two nights in January and had a wonderful experience. We booked a club level suite and were greeted curbside where we were whisked to the club lounge to check in. While we enjoyed a glass of champagne, one the attendants deftly checked us in. We had a snack on their beautiful afternoon offerings and were on our room in no time. The suite had a wonderful view of the pit area for the Formula one race from both the window and bath tub. The breakfast and evening offerings in the lounge were outstanding. The room was quiet and the bed comfortable. The lounge upgrade is well worth the price.",5,January 2017,

I stayed in a corner suite overlooking Marina Bay- marvellous views.My rooms were made up and tidied 3 times per day. Bathroom was large and clean - possibly a tiny complaint was the lack of electrical outlets at the large double basin vanity. We paid for executive lounge access and I would have to say that this was the most desirable lounge I have visited - including a chef to make breakfast omelettes and waffles, fruits, cakes, cheeses, hot foods and juices. Later in the day, hot and cold snacks , tea and coffee and good quality wines.

Pool is a bit basic though.   Will definitely come for another staycay soon.,5,October 2016,
The personal touch of the Club Access,MOH A R,"I was there for a staycation recently at the hotel with club access. Club access at the hotel was always a  treat for me. However, it is sad for me to know that though the personal touch of the Club access of the hotel is no longer available at the hotel. The staff failed to acknowledge my presence at the club, nor did they made an effort to introduce the self and get to know the guest and address each guest by the name. In my previous club stay with Ritz Carlton, I always feel at home due to the personal attention and the attentiveness provided. Addressing each guest as per each visit at the club made the stay more pleasant and memorable.

"Luxurious and personalised, classy and tasteful",Alessandro C,"on our honeymoon, we spent one night at the Marina Bay Sands on one way, and one night at the Ritz Carlton on the way back. DEFINITELY two different categories: here you are not a number, the service is personalised, if you run into the gentleman who checked you in, he will greet you by name and ask you how you are finding everything. You will be left with your struggle between muttering a response and wondering how on heart he can remember your name among the dozens and dozens of couples he checked in the same day... oh and he will also give you his own business card ""just in case you need anything"". quite a step up from ""type 0 on your phone to get the front desk""...

Nice view & spacious room!,Jan’s Travelog,"There are many things I like about this hotel. Room was spacious and quiet, the bathroom came with a view and the bed was comfortable. We asked for some amenities for our toddler and they were quick to accommodate and even provided a pair of small bathroom slippers.   Breakfast was great with plenty of choices. The only thing is it was challenging to get the food which was spread out in different sections when you are alone with a toddler.  Lobby area was spacious and staff was friendly.   The only improvement I could think of is probably have a proper play area for children instead of a room assigned. Perhaps some activity play kit at the breakfast area or given as part of the amenities in the room for family with young children. ",5,March 2017,

Fact the your bath tub is overlooking the bay is simply happiness,todxtreme,Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore is an all time classic favourite hotel. Gorgeous views of the Singapore Skyline. Easy access to the mall. Rooms are still very well maintained despite age of the hotel. Good hotel to spend quality time with family or even loved ones. Staff is friendly as usual and this is the Ritz Carlton signature for its brand that is renowned.,5,August 2016,
Excellent except one issue,volrath,"We loved the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore. But it's mostly about the view. It is better than Mandarin Oriental's Harbor view rooms. The Summer Pavilion restaurant is also very good for experienced foodies. However, i forgot an item in the room and the level at which they handled this issue is not up to their standards. Overall, I'd say Ritz Carlton Singapore is at he sme level with the St. Regis Osaka, Kempinski Vienna and Kempinski Berlin. Top notch!",4,May 2017,
Spectacular water views,LMMMTE,We stayed on the 30th floor. Ceiling to floor views across to Marina Bay Sands - must be the best water views in Singapore. The bath had the same stunning views.  Decor was exceptional. Beautiful leather and timber paneling.  Let down by a hot water tap not working in the bathroom basin - not helped by tardy response to have it fixed.,4,April 2017,
Almost unrivalled in Singapore,William B,"I have a long history with the Singapore Ritz-Carlton having based myself there during my wedding many years ago and visited regularly in the subsequent years. It has hardly changed over this time. The lobby is still as grand as ever, the service is still superlative and the rooms are some of the biggest you will find in Singapore with the correspondingly large bathrooms which always raise the question as to whether you can be seen taking a bath from the streets below, especially on the lower floors! The beds are completely scrumptious with thick duvets and fat pillows. The top floors were apparently being renovated during my stay but I did not see or hear any disruption and the stay was as painless as ever. For the first time ever, I visited the very appealing pool which is…",5,May 2017,
First stay with Ritz Carlton Singapore,waiguank,"Had very good overall experience. It is he Ritz Carlton after all. The front desk was wonderful, the hotel staffs were wonderful. My kids loved the Ritz kids and asking to go back even after the stay.   However, the room I was given comes with creaky floor. It is annoying when you have a light sleeper with you. I have to avoid the ""traps"" when walking across to the bathroom. I would have thought that this portion should be well maintained.   My internet TV on that few days stay wasn't that great. It was pausing all the way. I had a hard time explaining to my kids why the TV program is like that.   Other than this 2 small quirk, the rest of the stay was great! Good location, great staffs and beautiful scenery. ",4,April 2017,

Exceeded every expectation.,PaulDRSouthampton,From the moment you arrive they know your name and treat you like royalty.  The breakfast was unreal and had a choice of every food you could ever imagine.  The bar was v relaxed and nice.  The hotel is so close to marina bay and the park with so much to offer like the garden in the clouds and other amazing places near marina bay sands.  From my experience at this hotel I would recommend it to anybody.  The room I had on the 25th even had a bathroom with a huge bath at the huge window looking over the building and some of the marina.  The views of the marina from the lounge in the room were spectacular.  Wow and thank you for a fabulous stay I wish it had been for longer.,5,April 2017,

No longer a true fit for luxury travelers,HK_Traveller05,"First of all, let me just say that the RC has a wonderful view. Every time you are in the room, you are reminded of why you have paid for the rates. Even though the furnitures and marbles and pretty much everything else feel a bit old. The color scheme in the room is a bit out fashioned. I had fond memories of the RC during my last stay about 4 years ago. I remembered the space to be light, airy, and full of energy. It's not quite how it feels now with lobby flooded with people, family, nannies, and the facilities in need of refurbishment.   Good things in the room: Beddings, bath robe, bath set up and view. Water pressure - debatable. Bad things in the room: All the sliding doors can be a bit confusing. There's no master switch for the living room light and bedroom at the same…",4,April 2017,

We took the room with an access to the lounge and luckily the room as well as the lounge were located on the last floor. The room was huge, with very comfortable bed and big bathroom (shower & bath with an amazing view). We also expected that mini bar is included in price, but not - everything was for extra price but it was not a big deal as we always could grab some snacks and drinks from the lounge :) However, it was possible to eat and drink only in the lounge and you are not allowed to take away even a glas of wine.

Best view of the Marina Bay Financial District from the Ritz Carlton Millenia Suite!,Brian O,"We had the opportunity to experience the Millenia Suite at the Ritz Carlton Millenia, Singapore over the Easter weekend. The room was spacious and well laid out. Finishing was luxurious and large mirrors were used as wall cladding to bring in the Million Dollar View of the Marina Bay Financial District right into the room. Both day time and night time views were overwhelmingly gorgeous!   We had the twin beds which were really comfy. I was there with my wife and 2 sons. There was ample sleeping space for us all without the necessity of  requesting for an additional bed. Even the toiletries and amenities such as towels and pillows were of the highest standards.   We looked forward to the sumptuous spread made available during breakfast at The Colony every morning. Needless to…",5,April 2017,
Great Singapore stay.,Miguel G,Always great stay at A Ritz-Carlton. Only downside is you cannot earn Ritz-Carlton or Marriott rewards at this property. Although the hotel and rooms are starting to become a bit tired it's still a wonderful property. Elegant and Classy.,5,April 2017,
Very nice hotel only one minor complaint,jamesfX9802LK,"Overall I was quite impressed with the property and staff.  Very well trained and attentive.  My only complaint is that I tend to prefer my room to be very cool, which I was not able to achieve below 21 degrees centigrade.  Room was extremely nice and large.  Nothing but compliments to staff for attention to detail.",4,April 2017,
"Top notch service, big rooms, great food, great location",Jason T,"Situated in the Marina Bay area in central Singapore, the structure of the hotel itself spells out class & grandeur. The service matches up to the level of the beauty of this hotel that is tastefully decorated with lovely art pieces & artifacts.   We got the Deluxe room looking towards Kallang and it was fantastic. Having stayed in a number of 5-star hotel in Singapore, and also in that area, Ritz Carlton has the biggest room(Deluxe) of them all. Of course it comes with that price tag per night.   This hotel is a good choice if you like a mix of some shopping, some good view & reasonably good location. You would consider it great if what you are looking for is to spend the afternoon chilling in the lounge over tea, taking things slow in the evening and spending more of your time…",5,December 2016,
Superb,flyaway48,"From the moment the doorman opened our car door to the moment we left, it was a great experience, as staff were so friendly and attentive. Our room looking over marina bay was comfortable and spacious and the automatic blackout blinds made it an easy place to sleep after a long flight. The breakfast had a amazing choice for all tastes in an unusual and attractive setting.  If you get the chance use the new fantastic pool area to relax  ",5,March 2017,

Faultless 5 star service every time!,JACKI S,"This is our 3rd visit to the Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore, which was amazing as every other visit. We have returned here each year as we love Singapore, however this amazing hotel is more than 50% of the reason we return. We choose to stay at Club level in a Premier Suite with a Marina Bay view.  This corner room has the most fantastic view and is worth the extra cost to stay here.  The rooms are beautifully appointed and Housekeeping kept our room immaculate throughout our 12 night stay. From the moment we arrive, the staff are faultless, from the bellboys and doorman right through to management.  All of the staff we meet, make an effort to remember our names and welcome us personally every time they see us. The Club level is where we feel most at home and are treated like…",5,March 2017,
Great Experience at Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore,ykeechoi,"Comfortable, spacious room. Well organized system with kind staffs. Everything is perfect that I'm willing to revisit and recommend my friends, or colleagues for staying in Singapore.

Love to be here again. Thanks to entire staffs at The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore.",5,April 2017,
Disappointingly Average,BachIsGreat,"I booked a Club room, given a number of rave reviews of the Ritz Club experience here on TripAdvisor.  At over 500+USD/night and these great reviews, I had high expectations and was quite excited prior to my stay.  Unfortunately, the actual stay was disappointing and decidedly average.  Simply put -- the high price of the Club room is, generally speaking, unjustified.  It is unlikely that I will stay here again.  As is customary with my reviews, here are a list of CONS and PROS -- to keep my review short, I will include only some points: CONS: 1)	UNIMPRESSIVE, UNHYGIENIC FOOD IN THE CLUB LOUNGE: booking a Club room here entitles you to, among other things, admission into the Club Lounge and its 5 “culinary presentations” every day – breakfast, midday snacks, afternoon tea, hors…",3,April 2017,

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for luxury and high end service. ",5,April 2017,
Exceptional customer service,Ann Maris Y,"The Ritz is a wonderful place to stay in many ways. The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast and lunch buffets are amazing. It's a bit of a treasure hunt as the food statations are located in different parts of the restaurant but everything is delicious. But even more amazing is the customer service.  After my stay at the Ritz I took a cab with a colleague to the airport. I was dropped off at a different terminal from my colleague who went on to the next terminal. When I got inside the airport, I realized I had left my passport wallet in the cab. I didn’t have my colleague’s mobile number and he didn’t seem to be checking e-mail. I had no information about the driver or cab company either. I called the Ritz in a panic and spoke with Leilan. She took the next to nothing…",5,March 2017,

"Expensive, but nice hotel.",Louloulechat,"This is our first time in Singapore and just wanted to try the Ritz-Carleton. The room was beautiful and the view from the room was especially breathtaking. We had the use of the executive lounge and this was a good option to add to the stay in the hotel. The variety of the things they serve at the lounge was quite good. The spa/gym area is also very nice. There are not so many people who use the sauna and steam bath, so I was alone when I went there a few times. All and all, the service was excellent at the Ritz-Carleton. Everyone is very attentive and helpful.",5,February 2017,
Another amazing trip to Singapore,cuttyathome,"We stayed 5 nights in 2 interconnecting rooms with Marina Bay view. The hotel, service and views are first class, the staff extremely helpful and friendly. I'd thank to thank them all, especially Phil in the Colony restaurant who remembered us from last year and Christine at the front desk. The renovated pool area is lovely and we enjoyed spending time relaxing there after busy days out and about with the kids. I have stayed many times over the years on business and more recently on vacation with the family. I'd always like to return and stay here, but we found it very expensive this year, of which a lot is due to the strong local currency. ",5,April 2017,

Our friends ask us why we keep returning to the same hotel time after time, and the answer is quite simple. No where else have we ever experienced the level of service that we do here. From the ladies & gentlemen at the door, to the the concierge, housekeeping and everyone we met, the service is impeccable. We once stayed again in a Club Premier Suite and it is in the Club that the staff really out do themselves. What a great group of people led by Gwen the hotel has here in the Club lounge.

Amazing stay with our family,Renjay27,"We stayed for 5 nights with out two young boys, from the moment we entered the hotel we were greeted with warmth and kindness.

The hotel staff was unbelievably helpful, cheerful, and couldn't do enough to ensure that our stay was pleasant.  The location is awesome.  Right across from the harbor, and walking distance to many attractions.  Easy, taxi to any other locales.  The fitness center and spa were great, with almost all the equipment I use with my personal trainer at home.   The pool area is so serene, almost forgot that I'm in the middle of the big city.  Can't say enough good things, will definitely stay again when back in Singapore.",5,March 2017,
5 night in a club room.  Excellent but pricey,Darren,"This was my third time visiting Singapore.  I've stayed at the Pan Pacific, Marina Bay Sands and now the Ritz Carlton.  The club lounge was fantastic, to be honest I think it made our stay.  The breakfast buffet was great and it was nice to be able to grab a few beers after a long day working. The staff are very nice across the hotel from the door men to waitresses in the lounge.  My brother and I had a Marina Bay view room and it was one of the nicest views I've ever had from a hotel.  The only negative I would have is that I wasn't a massive fan of the pillows.  5 nights in a club room with a few added extras to the room cost £3000+ which is pretty high but you get what you pay for.  The staff here will make you feel a lot more welcome than they would at some of the other 5…",5,March 2017,

"It's more than a hotel, it's like a second home",xbanker,"In the early and mid 2000's, i had a chance to stay here frequently, about 2-3 time per year during my business travel to SG.  For me, this Ritz property holds a special place in my heart as it's the first true luxury property that I have had the pleasure of staying in.  The rooms are great and so is the bathroom with the huge window.  Took me over 10 years to visit again in 2016 but this time to enjoy a dinner seafood buffet with my wife.  Still a gem!  The room rates have gone up with the improving SG economy.  I remember you could stay here for $100 USD/night but definitely not now.  During recent stay, I made a poor, poor choice to stay at the Westin.  I wish I had stayed here or at the St. Regis.  Oh well, live and learn.  Still a 5 star in my books.",5,September 2016,

Nice room for a family,mohshina,"We're a family of 5 (2 adults + 1 child + 2 toddlers), got the deluxe room and the reservation department we're OK with us packing the room despite the high number of occupants. Due to this, we ended up stating for 4 nights which I think is just nice.   Everyone loved it, the view, the amenities and the nice view. Kids will be kids, the room became a mess in no time. But housekeeping knew about this and kept coming often to clean the place up in no time. Everything within control was kept near perfect condition in no time.  Therefore, next time you stuck here for work/conference/etc, bring your family with and all of you will have a nice time here. The infrastructure is sufficient to handle all of you.",5,March 2017,
Outstanding service,Endeav0ur,From Frederick at the front door to Evan at reception the service at Ritz Carlton was excellent during my stay.  Outstanding.  I was able to order a quick room service (laksa was nice) meal at the front desk when checking in late in the evening and they even extend my check out time the following day to accommodate my flight time.  It was personal service all the way. I'll be sure to stay here again next time I'm in town thanks to the efforts of these guys.,5,March 2017,

"Friendly, but sterile",Mike W,"Weeklong stay for a conference/business trip. Typical Ritz service, everyone very nice and always greeted by my name.   Breakfast buffet outstanding, plenty of choices.   Conference facilities were good, but a bit dark (makes it hard to not nod off when you're jet lagged)  Was given a lower floor room with a lousy view. Asked if I could get something better but they told me would be an additional 150 SgD per night. Understandable I guess.   Wallpaper was peeling in bathroom but other than that room itself was fine.",4,March 2017,
Excellent Customer Journey @Ritz-Carlton,Andhyka S,"My first experience staying here really sets my heart on the hotel. When I arrived by taxi, the greeter accompanied me up to the reception desk. Along the conversation he address me by name. Welcome drink was also refreshing.   The room and bed is very spacious. The bathroom is great and I like the toiletries. The view is also amazing.  When I had to eat before dawn, the room service officer was friendly and the food tasted great. Also when I asked for mineral water, they always gave me more than I requested.  My second stay there was with my family. During the check in process, the greeter accompanied my son and wife.   Love this hotel.",5,April 2016,
Memorable dinner,720jamesy,"Went for buffet dinner with friends. Very crowded even for a weekday evening so reservation is a must. The choice of food, space layout and service were above average although the array of dessert could be improved. It is a nice place to dine and to chill as it is surprisingly quiet enough to have a conversation.",4,March 2017,
Poor Start but more than made up for it,Darren L,"So I arrived at check-in and it was clear that they were struggling, my room was not ready and I had to return on three separate occasions,  They offered me alternative rooms but they were not what I had booked.  Eventually they offered me an upgrade of a corner suite which was amazing, the room was spotless with some fantastic views of the bay, the in-room facilities were top notch and the room service was first class, I have stayed in many hotels like this but this was by far and away one of the best.  Douglas and his front desk team were extremely helpful and always willing to answer any questions, if I could make one small suggestion it would be to improve the checking-in system, although other than that, I would highly recommend a stay there if only for the wonderful views.",5,March 2017,
Hotel with a View,Sophie B,"We stayed in the club room with Marina Bay view. The view is very nice reminds me of Sydney or Honk King skyline.   The room is very clean and spacious.

What you'd expect of a Ritz-Carlton,R_H-Bonds,"This Ritz-Carlton was very consistent to what I experience of the brand in other countries... while they do not participate on Marriott Rewards (disappointing for sure, but I knew that going in) the property has an amazing team. From check-in, to the restaurants and room service, pool team... everything was really good. The rooms are a bit ""tired"" but still quite well kept. The bed is very comfortable, the bathrooms are large and it has good strong water pressure. The desk facing the bay is an amazing place to catch up with work and connect with friends over FaceTime.

In particular, we must single out Michelle for a special mention. She looked after us brilliantly and her manner was exactly what we would expect - always on  hand to me every sure we had everything we wanted - she is a credit to your hotel.

Forgot my stay review....,Donald M,"Sorry.  Well hotel at the St. Regis and well needed after 17hr flt from San.Fran  Hotel very nice and on the bay. Close to super shopping malls l, gatden by the bat, flyer and mamy more sights by walkway.   Hotel was great at time of visit the pool area was under renovation bit the gym was operational and very spaces and good equipment.  The rooms was deluxe, but very roomy and faced out to water. Nice views, nice sitting area and comfy room.   My best take away from a nice room and close location to many sites and easy access to taxicabs was the breakfast. Cant rave more how good and exciting variety of Asian, American, South Asian cuisine was available and for breakfast. Wow. So so yummy and so, much variety and flavors.

Will Go Back!,Follow_The_Cat,"Situated in an ideal spot, not congested unlike in Orchard area. Walking distance to Marina Bay Sands where one can spend the whole day of high-end shopping and eating at a handful of celebrity chef restaurants. If you fancy more middle class shops/restaurants, Ritz Carlton is connected via walkways to Marina Square, Millennia Walk, and Suntec. Staff and management were incredibly polite, helpful, and absolutely luxury service oriented. Loved the gym and pool. Will definitely stay here again. ",5,March 2017,
Great Stay with Excellent Staff,Aguy_98,"Revisited this hotel after an initial visit with some issues.  This stay was wonderful and I was able to use more of the facilities.  The rooms are large and comfortable, excellent gym and pool facilities, great breakfast buffet and number one is the friendly helpful staff in every area of the hotel.  Will be sure to return.  I guess the room size, comfort and amazing views along with the great service make it one of the best choices in Singapore.",5,March 2017,

Amazing Hotel and Best view,Kurniawvic87,"Stayed here for a short business trip . The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained. I love the view from the bath room. The staff are incredibly friendly and polite.  They will always look for ways to make your stay memorable.  The House keeping Staff even brought me a bookmark and removed the hair from my brush.  Truly an exceptional experience!!  The corridor and room is good smell but different on other floor.  And the club lounge is good too  Will surely come back with my family again and keep it up the good work. ",5,January 2017,
Impressive but sometimes slightly impersonal,London_Brief,"I stayed at the Ritz Carlton in February 2017 on a brief business trip to Singapore.  This was my first time at this hotel (having previously stayed on various occasions at The Mandarin Oriental, The Fullerton and The Raffles).  My Club Level room was the best that I have stayed in - spacious, with a pleasant, neutral decor, and very well equipped for business (lots of desk space, power points, efficient wifi), and it had an interesting city view.  However, the staff - though polite and ready to assist - has a rather detached manner, the Club Lounge was over-crowded, both at breakfast and cocktail time, and the hostess at the ground floor cafe tried to turn me and my colleague away when we went for lunch there, saying that they had no spare tables (in fact we found a table for…",4,February 2017,
Good but not worth price,Chandni S,The view was amazing and the bathroom and room generally were very well set. These were the only reasons for staying at this hotel. There was no affordable food or snack for us at the hotel and it was a long hike of 2 floors to go to any adjoining restaurant or mall. Plus window washers came outside the window 4 times without any warning although we had do not disturb sign on.,4,March 2017,
Amazing!,xroyalflush,The hotel was amazing! So much luxury. The best view to the Marina Bay is at the Ritz-Carlton! The staff was friendly and accommodating. The staff was also very thoughtful and suggested ideas of where to go. It was a very special experience in Singapore 🇸🇬,5,March 2017,
Best hotel in Singapore,MPW370,"A great hotel with an elegant, relaxing ambience.  Also great location and within easy reach of the rest of the city centre.  In my view, the best hotel in Singapore by a considerable margin.  The Colony Restaurant is particularly good.  Great selection of food and it is very popular with Singaporeans - which is always a sign that the food is good compared to the competition.",5,March 2017,
Ritz Carlton with Ritz Kids facility,kim leng l,"although disappointed with a smaller scale kids club compared to last time and renovated pool without any kids pool, kids still enjoy their stay with the safari theme.

And the view of our room is really fantastic. We love it! There are a lot of facilities, the fitness centre, meeting room, Swimming pool…where you can spend all day long. We also had a very good breakfast at the ritz Carlton club (32th sty) in the morning, the place is very nice and quiet. We enjoyed it very much. In a world,it's really highly recommended, and definitely worth a try.",5,March 2017,

Sunday brunch,KrisMat,Large selection of food all of very good quality. The unlimited champagne really was on tap with the waitresses always on hand to top up without being asked. Would have liked a few cocktails but they only had G&T which I don't like,5,March 2017,
Not a Rewards hotel,BizTravelerSF,"Nice expensive high end hotel, but if you're a loyal Rewards member, know that it won't matter. They don't participate, even though they can see your status. No upgrades, no perks, no points. If that matters to you, this will be a disappointment, because you're no one particularly special here.",3,March 2017,

"Amazing, spacious rooms",ozziehk,"We were in Singapore for a long weekend to visit family, and stayed at the Ritz Carlton Millenia.  I go to Singapore quite often for business and usually stay at one of the neighboring hotels but heard good things about the Ritz Carlton Millenia so decided to try it this time.  It is definitely the best hotel I've stayed at in Singapore so far.  The rooms are extremely spacious and modern, with super comfortable bed, almost black-out quality shades (highly appreciated when traveling with a toddler), and luxurious bathroom.  The one drawback is that breakfast (for us it was included) can get very packed and we saw lines for people waiting to get seated by 9am.  It wasn't an issue for us since we always hit breakfast early with our toddler.  This will probably become my go-to…",5,January 2017,
Great place to stay.,Vachira,Touchable design .... great atmosphere... great food. Cozy room and warm staff.

Way beyond our expectations,CaliforniaTraveler17,"From the moment we arrived, to the gorgeous suite (#2026) we were thrilled. The club floor is the only way to go.

We have traveled a great deal but this was an exceptional experience. Thank you Ritz.",5,March 2017,
Sunday Champagne Brunch,Mathew T,Excellent variety of food with plenty of everything. A good way to try certain foods if you've been unsure of them in the past. All very good quality.  The champagne is very free flowing - we were never left with an empty glass. Sometimes being topped up after only a few sips.  All staff were courteous & friendly.   Only downside we found was there is only one choice of cocktail & this changes weekly. Could have been a few more on offer.   It seems expensive but the quality of food & unlimited amount of Moët makes it worth the cost.,5,March 2017,
Exceptional service and amazing rooms.,BrunswickTraveller,"This is the only place we stay in Singapore (after many years of trying other fine hotels only to wonder why we bothered).  It offers amazing value.  Very large rooms, even at entry level, and spacious bathrooms with stunning views and luxury amenities.  The new pool area is fantastic; so pleased the old pool has been left unchanged (just re-tiled) as it is great for swimming lengths.  The new Spa is a welcome addition to the hotel.  Fantastic service all round and great recognition for old-timers.    Food here is also exceptional from Room Service to a Michelin Star.  The lobby bar has a very special atmosphere.    Great management who are VERY visible and always engaging.    Fantastic location; only 15 minutes from the airport, a short stroll to Marina Bay Sands, easy walk to…",5,March 2017,

Fine dining at its best,combatgoose,"We visited for a buffet dinner during the week. It was an experience I would recommend to anyone who enjoys their food- such variety of food of outstanding quality in one place is not to be missed.   Staff was exceptional- our waiter Darren was the best, very nice, polite and attentive. We all loved him!  Great value for money as well, ask about an evening promotion for drinks.  In addition to the exceptional food and staff, the dining rooms are beautiful which makes the experience even more special. Visit even if you're not staying at the hotel.",5,March 2017,
Near the city center,Richard P,"I was here only for a company event. I can't comment on the rooms and other services.

Best fine dining buffet in Singapore,Wins,"Really impressed with the service provided, in this occasion the chef was absolutely lovely, Dennis was polite, friendly, was bringing the food to our table, making sure everything was perfect, also Angela did a good introduction for the beef craving. The environment was good, the manager Raj, was really nice. But the food in general was amazing!!! fresh oyster, really high quality food from Colony's laksa to beef Tomahawk! This chef was brilliant, and top class, and the most importantly making this one of our best experience in Singapore :)",5,March 2017,
A Valuable Experience,SandraN1,"Although we had some minor issues at the check-in due to a long wait, the front staff made sure that we felt comfortable in the lobby. You can see that they are trying their best to locate two rooms next to each other. The bathroom is great especially a bathtub overlooking the entire bay (although be careful since occasionally there are some window cleaners outside passing by) and their bath amenities smelled nice. The room was spacious, however, it felt a bit stiff and we mainly think that's because of the materials used for furniture, walls and carpet. It was my sister's birthday and they took care of everything I asked them to: flowers, cake, candle, dinner reservations. But the loveliest part is that next day, we received a card from the lady who check us in, asking whether…",5,November 2016,
"Yet another amazing visit, this place never fails to please",holidayshoes,"We have been coming here since it opened in 1996 and the quality of the staff, service, rooms and food is exceptional. If you are able to get a Marina Bay room the views are wonderful especially at night. The pool and spa have been given a comprehensive makeover and are lovely. The Colony restaurant has a buffet that we feel is one of the best in the world. Eva at the pool, Kevin in F&B, Nabil who looked after us in The Colony and last but by no means least is the wonderful Sheila in Front Office - all made this a trip to remember THANKYOU !",5,March 2017,

EXCELLENT !!!,C L,"Been going back to Singapore every year for the past years, and I've tried different hotels in different areas.  The Ritz-Carlton Millenia simply lives up to--- or rather exceedingly surpasses all your expectations from a 5 star hotel.  The moment we stepped out of our taxi , we were given the utmost care and attention as if we were returning VIPs!!!  We were always addressed with our names, and someone actually stood with us as we were waiting in line for check-in.  Great staff, especially AlGin who checked us in. Smiling, polite staff offered us umbrellas as we were walking out to take a stroll to Marina Bay.  Little, yet significant gestures showing just how detailed the services are in this magnificent hotel! Great breakfast with a lot of selections..... Wonderful view of…",5,February 2017,

Club lounge,ALKR,The club lounge welcome children but there was no food really suitable provided for children even when we have requested with the chef. It was disappointing that they did not really make an effort.  The location of the hotel is excellent.,3,February 2017,
Nice to splurge once in a while,Terry F,"It is nice to splurge once in a while, so why not splurge at the Ritz Carlton, and why not while in Singapore.   The Ritz does stand by its name, and luxury is its middle name.  We were given a room on the 30th floor, and just by the view offered from the bathtub, my wife did not want to leave the room.  Cannot say enough about the hotel staff -- always smiling, always professional, always willing to go that extra mile for its guests.  But I guess, this is what you pay for in a luxury hotel with the Ritz Carlton name. The location of the Ritz is one of the many positives of this hotel.  You can walk to the Marina Bay, the Gardens by the Bay, and the Singapore Flyer.  The hotel is also within walking distance to the subway, although Uber is a viable option for getting around…",5,February 2017,
This place is the best,Sigh72,I seriously loved this hotel.  We were staying for a layover but wanted a bit of comfort and pampering and boy did we get it.  The staff from the moment we got out of the taxi were to a person friendly and helpful but without seeming forced or pushy.  Our room was amazing with a great view of the water surrounding high rises.  I simple cannot fault one thing.,5,April 2016,
Excellent Hotel for the Business Traveler,Joel J,"Excellent location, close to the marina and other attractions.  Easy access to nearby shopping, restaurants, and running paths. Very limited ""nightlife"" at the hotel but easy to access Clark Quay and other places by foot or taxi.  The rooms are spacious and very well kept.  The views are incredible if you have a Marina view room.  Not sure what the other rooms overlook.  Breakfast is a bit pricey but well worth it, expansive selection from all around Asia.  The Fitness Center is very well equipped with new equipment  Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.",4,February 2017,
Staff here made all the difference,LJam09,"This is a decent hotel that caters well to business travellers. Well located around the marina, has all the facilities you'd expect and the rooms are well-equipped, if a little tired / in need of a bit of renovation. View across marina from my room was phenomenal. Restaurant for breakfast / lunch - especially choice and quality of food - was excellent. Lifts a bit annoying - I waited 10 mins for a lift to get down from 23rd floor to lobby.  What set it apart for me was the staff. I was feeling unwell the evening I arrived and they were super-helpful and genuinely concerned. Generally there was always a member of staff on hand to help with anything, nothing was too much trouble.",5,February 2017,
amazing view to marina bay,enjoy561,"if you like great view to marina bay and excellent service Ritz Millenia is the best choice. Also superb view to Marina Bay Sands ( we decided not to stay there, too big, big distances between towers and no nice atmosphere ), restaurants are highly recommended, only bar at ground floor was disappointing",5,February 2017,

A truly luxurious experience,tabbyanne,"My stay here was a wonderful experience.  The location, the staff, the views and the facilities were all exceptional, and there were a few tears when I left! I stayed in a club room, with a Kallang view, which was actually as interesting as the Marina view, but using the club lounge meant I had the best of both worlds.   I can't praise the staff enough.  I felt extremely welcome, greeted by name with a smile on every visit to the lounge, and my preferences were remembered (two Singapore Slings and then on to the excellent Malbec).  The chefs were obliging and talented, wanting to know personal likes and dislikes, and I was especially well treated on my birthday - being away from home I expected it to be difficult, but actually it was delightful - and the day I left the chef…",5,February 2017,
It has seen its better days,JimKitch,"If you're staying in Singapore for 1-2 nights, grab a Club room at the Marina Bay Sands, which is much closer to the action, and (with the club access) you'll get better service.   Having traveled to 100+ countries, in and out of a lot of the world's best luxury hotels, I was disappointed in my stay at this Ritz.  At $600 USD / night, I was expecting much better, particularly as I had booked through AMEX Platinum.    This is a tired property, in need of some clean-up.  Start with pressure washing the some of the mold off the exterior and cleaning the interior carpets.  The hotel was understaffed at peak check-in and out periods (with 2 people at the desk).    The female concierge couldn't have been any less helpful to routine questions about what to do and how, with…",3,February 2017,
Loved it! Would stay again.,coheadam,"This hotel has excellent service and the rooms and hotel itself are beautiful. While the hotel is quite large and the lobby is always bustling with guests, the hotel staff make you feel like you're staying in a boutique hotel. They provide excellent personal service. Every time my wife and I returned from a long walk, the staff greeted us warmly and offered bottles of water. They remembered specifics about our activities so they could ask about our experience. They went above and beyond to make us feel taken care of. When I forgot sunscreen or goggles at the pool, the hotel staff provided both. When I had something I didn't want to carry around, they offered to take it to my room for me.

Amazing Ritz Carlton Singapore,joyfully1,"Ritz Carlton, Millennia, Singapore, thank  you for an amazing stay in your fabulous hotel.

Our experience in the Club Lounge was more than enjoyable; all the staff are extremely helpful, friendly and professional and you feel welcomed as a much valued guest.

Wonderful art hotel,Cristina Dragan,"The hotel has a great location, situated in the heart of Marina Bay. I was very impressed by the grandeur and the decorated interior of this hotel. They got more than 4200 pierces of art spread all over, from paintings to sculptures and futuristic shapes that dress the walls of the hotel. One of the best restaurants, in fact in top 5 restaurants on TripAdvisor are located exactly here. At the reception we were helped in an effective way, and also got lucky to be upgraded to a bigger suite. To our surprise we got a corner room with an amazing view of the Marina Bay Sands, the artscience museum plus the Singapore eye. The views were magnificent at night or early morning with great visibility. We enjoyed our stay and really hope to come back one day!  ",5,February 2017,

Beautiful corner suite with outstanding views and exceptional service,kim g,We arrived here from a very successful trip to KL where the previous hotel was outstanding and so this had a lot to live up to.  From being greeted at the front door we were taken up to club floor for swift and friendly check in. Our room was huge with a bathroom to match. The large bath in front of the panoramic window was incredible. The bed is large and comfortable with quality linen. It also had a lovely walk in wardrobe with safe. Although they have full tea / coffee facilities they will bring a complimentary hot beverage of your choosing to your room within 10 mins. Thats a lovely touch. AC was efficient and room cleanliness excellent.  My only complaint about the room was that there was no dressing table. It has a huge desk but no mirror!

The rooms are large, spacious & modern and the large windows offered fantastic views of the bay (moreso at night). The staff were all helpful but in particular the  concierge who was very informative and cheerful. The children's facility on L4 was a nice (and useful) bonus. The surrounding area (all within walking distance) has plenty to offer and the MRT (underground/subway) is only a 10 minute walk away.",5,January 2017,
Not worth the cost,William O,Spent a weekend in Singapore en route to Australia.  After significant research opted for the Ritz even though it was priced far higher than many other 5 star hotels such as the Four Seasons and the Mandarin.  Unfortunately it was not worth it.  The club level corner suite I stayed in had a great view but was tired.  The general  service level was fine but certainly not particularly special.  We arrived early and were told we would be contacted as soon as our room was ready but  that never happened. Could not relax by the pool as although it is now open after having been closed it still has noisy construction going on.,3,February 2017,
Not what you expect from Ritz Calton...,henriet99,"It has good location and a decent view. That's all, alas. It is definetely not what you expect from 5 stars. I can forgive the dated decor and the feeling you are in the big shopping mall or railway station, but I can't forgive: 1. Very long check-in, it really took so long... 2. lack of sound proof windows, you can hear the car noise and everything 3. very soft bed, absolutely uncomfortable, bad pillows, no pillow menu. 4 Terrible air-con - it is very warm inside your room, as they call them ""environmentally friendly"", so you cant make a temperature that is good for you, it is really hot!!!  5. they have a seriouse problem with water temperature - it is either hit, or cold, you can t regulate it normally... having a shower is very difficult.  6. crazy system with electric…",1,February 2017,
Fantastic Stay,SC061987,Super friendly staff from the minute you enter this wonderful hotel. Its like friends welcoming you to their new home.

Suite life 🙂,Aminswiss123,"We booked a suite and due to some miscommunication on the booking, they gave us a different category room. Once they were informed of the mistake, the Ritz made up for it with a nicer suite. The room was wonderful, the breakfast buffet was good. We would definitely stay again because the ritz had really great service staff. ",5,December 2016,

Nothing but excellence,Dedy S,"Perfect experience. Excellent service and polite staffs. Food was heavenly. Dessert even more. Room and the view were beyond expectations.

Almost a Ritz!,Rajesh M,Doesn't recognize the Rewards Program! So how could it be assumed to be part of the Ritz stable of Hotels. Decent enough establishment but not in my view part of the Ritz Carlton family if it fails to recognize their Loyalty Pam!,4,February 2017,
Wonderful Service,Nice2Mt,"I stayed for three nights in a club delux room at the Ritz-Carlton in mid November during a three-week trip around South East Asia. During this trip we stayed in 6 different five star hotels in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Phuket and Langkawi and the Ritz Carlton Millennia was undoubtably one of the highlights. The service was outstanding from the moment we arrived at the front door to checking out. In fact at times the level of service could almost be overwhelming with all staff going out of their way to say hello and enquiring if there was anything you needed. It was impressive that the foyer staff would greet us by name every time we entered the hotel and accompany us into the lift to press our floor number asking how our day was etc.  I have stayed at most of the big…",5,December 2016,
Get what you pay for; Club level is awesome for privacy and service,BanhRan,"I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore for one night during a long layover in Singapore--I've wanted to give this hotel a shot for a long time, and I went ahead and booked the club level knowing that although this hotel is luxury, it is also gigantic and has hundreds of rooms on more than 30 floors, which would make for huge crowds (something that really diminishes the luxury value for me). That said, the club level bypasses all of that and you feel completely isolated, secluded and special.   Check in was a breeze. The staff picked me up at the curb, knowing exactly who I was from the moment they opened the taxi door. I checked in at the club level and had a welcome drink of my choice, which was excellent. Club rooms are on the 30th and 31st floors, which offer great views…",5,February 2017,
Truly amazing hotel,Mustafa K,"We stayed 6 nights in Ritz Carlton Singapore and all was an exceptional experience. The staff was very friendly, the hotel is truly one of the top hotels in Singapore.  Very nice and clean pool and helpful pool staff.   Very large rooms and super comfortable beds.  And the oscar goes to the breakfast. It was unbelievable. Everthing i tasted was 10 out of 10. You can find Asian/American/European even Middle Eastern food in the buffet with a wide range of choices. Believe it or not, you will love it. Breakfast hall is also very well decorated.  Location is just perfect. Just few steps from Helix Bridge and 5 min walk to The Shoppes, Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer.  Uber is the best choice for reaching other places. Sentosa Island (furthest place to the hotel) is less than…",5,July 2016,
Just a dream !,Candi_Star,"We had an amazing experience at the Ritz-Carlton last August.  My fiancé organized with the hotel staff a surprise, to propose.  It was magical.

Thank you, you're the best !!!",5,August 2016,
real 5 star quality,calamity_dv,"the room has real luxury feel, unlike some other hotels (similar price range) in Singapore. the view is amazing, my son loves the bathtub :)) breakfast buffet is amazing -- lots of typical asian dishes but very tasty. yum..  short walk to marina bay and there's Makansutra foodstalls nearby too if you crave for hawker food (although obviously many better options for hawker food in Singapore).  there's a mall at the back of the hotel, again lots of good meals too.  closest MRT is Promenade, around 300m away.",5,February 2017,
World class hotel,martin h,"The hotel has a fantastic location,the view from our incredible bedroom was mind blowing, the bedroom was very large with a large bathroom, which was furnished beautifully. The two restaurants were probably two of the best restaurants in Singapore, one being the best buffet restaurnt I have ever eaten in  , so much choose it is hard to describe. The other restaurant is a michalin star cantonisse restaurant  which is also worth a visit.it is worth knowing they do offer  a special deal for free flow wine and beer , but unfortunately we didn't know about this until the last night",5,January 2017,

Seek her assistance to took some group shots for us. She was friendly, professional and cheerful in assisting us to take some group shots for us. Kudos to the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Ritz Carlton. It's a culture of the hotel that made me a regular guest to the lounge, restaurant and the hotel itself. Each visit, I am there with my friends, it's a brand new experience for us. An experience that made my friends and I have a memorable moments.",5,February 2017,
Better Than Expected,douglasedwinf,"We received all we were expecting from the Ritz.  It's expensive, but worth it.  Facilities and room were amazing.  Go for a Bay View room which for us was wonderful.  The staff were all very helpful and courteous.  The location was great. Highly recommend.",5,January 2017,
Great location and comfortable but some lack of communication,Jmahg,We stayed for just two nights. The room was very nice but there were some impractical features. Not enough sockets in sensible places. Awkward wardrobe access and in particular safe access. Bed was comfortable and nice bathroom. Bathroom toiletries were good as well which is to be expected. We had executive lounge access which was good one night but not good the following with not so good service. I would also recommend you take some warm clothing if you are going to sit there for more than half an hour as the temperature is very cold. Drinks are served late and food is available according to in house timetable. Well worth the extra.  Our checkout experience was not very good with inaccurate billing and no attention to our luggage which needed to be stored for a few hours. We…,4,December 2016,

First Stay at the Ritz,SRE33,"We booked the Marina Bay view premium suite and the view was spectacular. Our stay was during the Chinese New Year and were lucky to view 3 nights' worth of fireworks held at The Float. The location was excellent, walking distance to shops and iconic places of interest (the Singapore Flyer, the Merlion, Garden By The Bay, and short taxi ride to Orchard Road and China Town).  The room was very clean and service staff were very friendly and attentive - i.e. response to requests were within minutes. We loved the variety of breakfast buffet served at The Colony (in-house restaurant) and the in-room dining were delicious. They also have a bakery open until 10pm.",5,January 2017,

Fabulous staff,mynewlifeistravel,"I recently visited here as I wanted to experience the ultimate service and hotel in Singapore, regrettably the hotel pool was under maintenance and this was not suitable during our stay. The check in was fast and efficient, although we did get a average room on level 5, which was then changed to level 26. The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside, and some of the fixtures inside could be replaced due to wear and tear. Overall we cannot wait to return with family and friends to see what changes have been made.",5,December 2016,
What a Hotel!,travellincfo,Just a beautiful property walking distance from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino and shopping center.  I was lucky enough to have a club level room (highly recommended) with access to the Club Lounge which was one of the best lounge experience I have ever enjoyed.  The service and food choices in the lounge (and the customer service) was a perfect 10!  Everything about this hotel spelled S E R V I C E! Great attention to detail and my room was just amazing.  I needed a shirt pressed in short order and they came through without hesitation.  The views of Marina Bay were fantastic (no need to leave your room to take pics!).    Obviously not the cheapest of hotels in terms of rate but worth every dollar for sure.  My new favorite hotel in Singapore. I will be back!!,5,January 2017,
Beautiful Hotel!,Roshlynn,First time ever staying at a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and loved it! As I pulled up the staff at the entrance was welcoming and someone even walked me from the front of the hotel all the way to the front desk. She never left my side and made sure I was taken care of at the front desk! Upon checking in I was fortunate enough to have met with Ms. Benzon who made the check in process a breeze! She was very kind and I truly felt that I was being taken care of by staying at the hotel! I walked into my suite and was taken back. I had a corner suite overlooking all of Singapore and when I had walked into the restroom the bathtub was overlooking the Singapore Flyer. Staying here made my stay in Dingapire worth it!

Some parts were a let down,Anzacng,"I have been to ritz carlton many times, having stayed there as well as had events at the ballroom. Each and every time, I was impressed especially with the empowerment of staff and utmost importance placed on customer experience.  My latest stay and event at the grand ballroom however was less than ideal.  My stay - we checked into a suite and room both club level. I came later and checked at the lower reception as I was too lazy to proceed up to the club reception. I should say the lower reception handled the check in flawlessly. A really nice gentleman saw me in queue and quickly guided me to a free Receptionist. I immediately felt the ritz Carlton hospitality even though my encounter with the reception was brief but good experience. Room was spacious and overlooking MBS.…",3,November 2016,
Amazing Place,Lazy R,"Honestly, the view of this hotel took my breath away. I usually don't like staying in a city hotel during my travels, but boy, this one is an exception. Although in the middle of the city, you won't feel the rush below, but instead, it's like the stars unfold in front of you when you look at the city lights. In a way, the view was calming. Aside from the spectacular view, the staff were excellent, as you would expect from a high end hotel. The food was also delicious and the service we experienced was unparalleled. Highly recommended if you are going to stay in singapore with great budget in hand.",5,June 2016,
Birthday celebrations,Agnes K,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a birthday cake in the room after I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday! Nice touch!

You can do better,Manydaysaway,"This hotel was pretty full and boy do you feel it. The queue at reception is ridiculously large. The rooms are tired bordering on exhausted with a strange lite wood veneer. If your room is facing the highway it can be a little noisy. You MUST MUST get a room overlooking the water, otherwise there is no point in actually staying at this hotel in my view. Breakfast is a huge sprawling affair but if you like variety rather than class this is for you. Labelling on what is what is sloppy and signifies a lacks of attention to detail that punctuates this hotel. For example I left my room at 8am and had to phone them at 2pm to make up my room. Although it says Ritz Carlton this Singapore branch does not stand up to the brand that stands for luxury and class elsewhere in the world. The…",2,January 2017,

Paranomic poster-like view,anhdaoquang,"The panoramic poster-like view of the entire Marina Bay is that amazing, and needs to be seen to believed from the Millenia Suite. As soon as I arrived, a handwritten note was presented to me by the hotel’s general manager. To my utter delight, a tray of snack items is presented to me as well. Such a great personal touch. It seems as if the hotel knows exactly what kind of food I like to eat. There is a sense of timeless and synonymous to luxury charm in every corner of this hotel. ",5,January 2017,
Oasis incite on steroids,LesIieI,"Recently stayed in Suite 2508 (we were upgraded)for 2 nights after a cruise.  When we arrived, we were surprised to see a Ritz-Carlton that was so busy (we found out later the Chinese New Year was the major reason) and large but our concerns were mitigated after we arrived at our room.  Not only was the suite spacious but we had a magnificant view towards the Sands Casino but we could see many of the well known buildings of the city.  The suite had a large sitting room, office and separated bathroom from the one in the bedroom.  It was beautiful.   The breakfast buffet was fabulous.  Anything you could imagine!

"Expansive Views, Expensive Views",T Ding,"While staying at the hotel room, I joked with my other half that perhaps it was time to knock down the interior and furnishings of the hotel suite that we were staying in to make way for less weary, and time-touched pieces. Although the suite that we were placed in was admittedly lit up in an unpretentious manner by the wide expanse of 3/4 floor length windows, allowing an almost 180 degree view of Singapore's brilliant skyline, there were times during the stay when I wished that the room held more to it than pure external attraction. For a hotel of this calibre, I expected more than the untouchable ceilings of the hotel lobby, the starched but well-worn uniforms of the female and male staff, and the obviously worn down carpets that have graced more than a few well heeled…",4,December 2016,

Another very enjoyable visit,David B,"So impressed with this hotel on first visit a year ago, we booked again for a couple of days after finishing a cruise in Singapore.  We were unable to get our room early ( cruise ships kick you off asap on the final day) as the hotel was, as usual, very busy but tourist bus rides and later visit to the hotel club lounge filled the time adequately.  The stay was short, only 2 nights this time but it was such a pleasure to be in this great hotel with well appointed rooms and attentive staff that demonstrate such courtesy, professionalism  and attention to detail.  Booking the Club level is a well worthwhile extra. Located on the 32nd floor, the views are simply stunning especially at sundown. The inclusive food and wine are of excellent quality and the staff so friendly and…",5,January 2017,
Stunning,FunkyMonkey001,Absolutely fantastic stay.  Staff are super attentive and efficient.  Setting is overlooking the harbour for many rooms.  Food was sublime and the general amenities were top class.  Bed room was well appointed with lots of luxury items and the bed gave one of the best sleeps I have ever had in a hotel.  Lots of working pace in rooms and good televisual equipment.  Not a bad thing to say about this hotel.  As close to perfect as it can get.....,5,September 2016,
Simply Stunning,Charlie1001,"i like to write very measured reviews and so try to avoid too many superlatives. But this hotel really is stunning.The architecture is exceptional with a really beautiful lobby and rooms that take your breath away. The standard rooms are very large with floor to ceiling windows in the bedrooms and a panoramic window in the bathroom immediately above the bathtub. The overall effect is remarkable and the rooms have the added advantage of being very comfortable - super comfortable beds, quiet aircon, not too many light switches and blinds that can be opened with a switch by the bed. The buffet lunch was also to be recommended. My only hesitation about the hotel is that, despite being a new building, the sound proofing is not as good as I would have expected and the rumble of…",5,January 2017,
Unforgettable Experience,Peter M,"If you want the best hotel experience, I'd really recommend this hotel. Luxury, attention to detail and location were outstanding. The brunch in the Colony Restaurant was second to none. The staff were great and the room was so comfortable that you could easily spend too much time there!",5,January 2017,
Avarage Stay in every aspect,ayseg84,"We stayed in one of the enhanced premier suites last summer in Ritz Carlton Millenia.  We also had the club access. You have to queue for breakfast for at  least 15 minutes in the lobby, very big hotel and very little personalized service. We realised that they forgot to give us information on kids activities in the hotel although we spend there 5 nights. We once had a late cleaning and we actually had to call the reception to request cleaning of our room. It is more of a business hotel than a leasure hotel. Overall, you pay a very high price for an ordinary service.",3,July 2016,
Great Location and view,indobeagle,"The hotel has great location and view.  Marina Bay Sands, Singapore Flyer, Garden Bay the Bay are walking distance. The staff are great, helpful and friendly. They have ""Tapendium"" as a new benefit in every room.  Tapendium is a digital compendium which enriches guest experience.  However, in my personal opinion, I would rather have smartphone which I could take it with me outside the hotel rather than the Tapedium.  I would rating this property excellent, however we had not so good experience when we checked-in. Therefore, I only rate this property very good.  I had booked the room several months before and informed them that we would like to have early check-in because we had early flight and travel with kids.

The food was gourmet and beautifully presented.  So many choices throughout the day, along with an extensive bar.  But, it’s the service that’s even more impressive. The entire hotel staff are very professional and anticipate your needs before you know it. From the front desk, bell desk and restaurant, it’s attentive service. Club Concierge Mr. Bala Chandra came to my rescue after I told him I couldn’t find a watch battery for my favorite watch. He graciously took my watch after work to his jeweler and the next morning my watch was waiting for me running on time!  I was so pleased!  The two restaurants in the hotel are very good, Summer Pavilion has a Michelin rating…",5,January 2017,

"Excellent Rooms, Service, Buffet So/So",Dan C,"The Ritz Carlton Millenium is a great place to stay. Our room had a jaw dropping view of the Port and City. We had several special requests, and they were handled promptly and expeditiously. Staff is exceptional.   We found breakfast offerings quite nice, but the dinner dining options are fairly limited, and do not match the variety and quality of nearby restaurants like those in the nearby Pan Pacific, for example.   The buffet is scattered about in an unusual layout, and it is quite pricy for those with smaller appetites.   All in all, great place to stay, but you may want to consider other dinner dining options. ",5,January 2017,
Nice room,W K H,The room is very spacious and the bathroom is a place you will want to spend a lot of time. I topped up a small amount to get a bay facing room. The view was worth the money. Totally enjoyed the stay.,5,June 2016,

What a wonderful hotel!,travellingmama1,"My husband and I were booked in a club floor room for 5 nights during a convention and we LOVED everything about it. From the view to the awesome bath tub all the way to the exceptional service-it was all TOP NOTCH! The housekeeping staff saw that we loved the mini chocolate bars that they would leave on our bedside during turn down service so they made it a point to leave us a plateful of them every night. At the Ritz, it was all about the little things. We would run every morning and upon our return  the people at the front desk would offer us bottles of water and cold towels to freshen up. I would definitely be back th3 next time I travel for business. Loved every bit of our stay here.",5,December 2016,
Life At The Ritz,michelleJ1034FW,"Both my wife and I enjoyed our 30th wedding anniversary at this hotel.  From the moment we arrived we were treated like old friends.  We arrived just before new years eve and we were hoping for a good view of the fireworks on the night. Our room was immaculate and the decor and quality of furnishing nothing less than you would expect from a first class hotel. Importantly the view from the 22nd floor was jaw dropping and the whole Bay and city scope became our canvas. New years eve was a special time that we will never forget, at 11.45 we returned to our room, we jumped out of our tux and dress and put on our jim-jams to watch the most spectacular ending to 2016 you could ever hope for.

Great place to stay,Abhishek S,"Fantastic hotel - more so if you want to be close to the CBD of Singapore. If you're in the city for business, it's very likely your office is within a kilometer's radius so it's a great and convenient location. The view from the top floors is great and the service cannot be faulted. Only downside - they don't participate in the rewards point programs so that's one thing to keep in mind.",4,August 2016,

The Guest Relation correspondant for the day always changes however, they keep updates of the things that were done. I like to thanks other than Germaine, these 2 people as well.

"Flying Visit, but still incredible",Ben L,"My wife and I stayed in the Millenia for the last night of our honeymoon before we headed home. We had never stayed in an R-C hotel before but the class associated with the name and the positive recommendations from Family and Friends gave us very high expectations - I'm pleased to say the Millenia exceeded these. We were met by impeccably dressed concierge at the entrance to the hotel who took our luggage from us and escorted it straight to our room. First impressions of this hotel were almost overwhelming, the amazing globe structure as you walk in is breath taking, the bar in the opposite wing to the reception area was also very striking. The reception area was tidy and well presented, the staff were very polite and welcoming. The room itself was a fantastic size with a…",5,June 2016,
Staycation,523ceciliat,"This was my family's first stay at the Ritz-Carlton Singapore and we were impressed with almost every aspect of the services. From the time we have checked-in with the front desk with Alvin, till our encounters with Katherine at the Club's lounge. Every staff was professional! The bedroom and bathroom were famously spacious and well-fitted with thoughtful details. The bathrobe was the softest I have encountered and the slippers were thick and cushy! I did feel the scent of the toiletries was kind of 'out-datedly pungent' but this may be personal. The views were stunning from most windows. The Christmas decorations and the food range and displays were Instagram-worthy. Well done Ritz-Carlton Singapore! ",5,December 2016,

Book early and ask for Marina Bay Views,Stewart A,"We were told on arrival that we were on the 7th floor, but upon asking if we could have a higher floor they upgraded us to the 29th floor. Nice! However, we weren't able to get a room on the side of the hotel which faces Marina Bay (We've never been able to manage that!)  I think the trick is to book early and ask specifically for a room with a Marina Bay view. It doesn't matter too much if it's a lower floor, as that side of the hotel has good views, regardless.",4,December 2016,
Book early and ask for Marina bay view,Stewart A,"We had a staycation at Ritz-Carlton just before Christmas and it was very pleasant. There was definitely a feeling of festivity in the air around the hotel and at nearby Marina Square.  We were initially told we were on the 7th floor but when asked if there was a higher floor, we were upgraded to the 29th floor. Nice! But it wold be even nicer to be on the side with the Marina Bay views.  I think you have to book early and ask for a room with that view, as they're obviously in high demand.",4,December 2016,

Excellent quality and very good club lounge,Ian B,"The room was good with excellent fittings. The club lounge had excellent breakfast and other food and drink service. Overall atmosphere and the restaurants were good.  Disappointed that there was no availability at the spa.   Biggest issue is that despite being called a Ritz Carlton, it doesn't belong to the Ritz Carlton rewards programme, so points are not earned and membership status goes unrecognised. This is a real drawback, particularly as it is not mentioned in advertising. Very misleading and the clear reason not to rate it higher. ",4,December 2016,

Awesome place!,Jax C,Tried all the cakes and desserts the restaurant have to offer! One of the best buffets I had for the longest time.  Also wanted more ice cream besides the standard menu and Got a special cake from chef Vivian that's not in the menu!  Superb!,5,December 2016,

Greatest View,Shenta T,"The best thing about your hotel is the people, they are warm and always welcoming. The ok thing is about the maintenance, few broken lights in the elevator and here and there, everything ages, but a good maintenance team should keep things working and nice. The bad thing is about the breakfast, there seems like alot of food, but hardly anything is there, I mean, please look at the breakfast buffet bar, for Chinese food it is like street noodle, and taste like it too, the steams are no differ than frozen food.  The western kitchen serves MacDonald flavor sausage and egg, little too crispy bacon, and a little over salty grill potato.  The chicken porridge is the worst, no flavor of what so ever.  The cold plates section only have so little things people ( the level of customer…",5,December 2016,
Excellent stay! Great services!,Dhonx,"My husband and I came from milenia walk and were greeted warmly by one of the public relations. He was Indian-Singaporean (very bad of me to have forgotten his name). He took our luggages and walked with us to the reception. While waiting for the queue, he asked us to guess how old the building was. We chatted for quite sometimes. He even told me that the pool was currently underconstruction (as I read on tripadvisor), but the hotel management has provided us with shuttle bus to go to W Sentosa or private returned car to Conrad.  The experience we had was different from any other 5star hotel we stayed so far, Ritz Carlton Milenia's staffs were trained with sincerity. We were welcomed with hot drinks and cookies too. The second day of our stay, a welcomed note and chocolates were…",5,December 2016,
Beautiful hotel,Mark S,"The best hotel in Singapore, the hotel is conveniently located and the staff is top notch.  The service is unmatched in the industry.  I only wish they participated in Marriot points.  I highly recommend this hotel to business travelers",5,December 2016,
Family Staycation was excellent,Rumin Y,"This is a family staycation and the service given by the staff at Riz Carlton fully satisfied our needs and all your staff were very friendly and approachable especially Mellissa from Ritz Kids Play area, whom we have a lovely chat with her. She provide us with lots of information on where we can go during out staycation at Ritz. The Manger from the front desk Ms Murphy Loy was very polite and help us a lot during our check in at Ritz. The overall stay at Ritz Carlton was a fantastic one, except for a small cut on my foot, due to the old wooden flooring in the room. I would definitely recommend all my friend to stay in Ritz Carlton if they are planning for a staycation in Singapore.",5,December 2016,
Excellent Stay,Charlotte P,"As usual, we had an excellent stay at the Ritz-Carlton. The hotel is well maintain despite it being 20 years old. All the staff treated us well with warmth and sincerity. They have a very nice program for the children and my son loves it.",5,December 2016,

Outstanding.,5,December 2016,
Excellent hotel -outstanding club level service,MC7894,This is a first rate Ritz Carleton with exceptional service.  Rooms are modern and very comfortable. Bay View is exceptional.  Lobby buffet is grand.  Club level was one of the best.  The club level chef was wonderful.  Choices were interesting and varied. My only complaint was that this hotel doesn't participate in the Marriott rewards program.,5,November 2016,
"Great ambience, good food, excellent service",J L,"The ambience was great. A fully packed restaurant at lunch but with the cleverly arrange food stations, we see the people but not feel cramped.

Perfect stay,Jack Hon,"The stay was perfect from the service, to the view, the room, the room service, the breakfast spread, the gym, etc. First the service; from the moment I arrived, I was well looked after. The service is personal and professional. I arrived around 12pm and they did non have a room ready for me, which is a little unfortunate but my luggage was well taken care of and I went off to lunch and work returning to my room with the luggage also stowed in my room. The room is huge with spectacular view over Marina Bay Sands and the marina financial district. It is well equipped and has a large bathroom that has a big bath that you could indulge in. Everything that you expect of a top end 5* hotel, they delivered. One detail though which annoyed me was that the TV was placed to the right of…",5,November 2016,
A Hotel That Genuinely Cares for Customers,Royston Hugh H,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights celebrating our 27th wedding anniversary. We booked a Suite Escape with breakfast included but the front desk gave us another package without breakfast. We were upset and reported back to the front desk when Tina took matters in hand. She upgraded us to the Millenia Suite (1000 sq ft) with stunning panoramic views of the Marina Bay and breakfast was included. She also sent an anniversary cake to our suite. We will never forget our wonderful stay. We felt that the hotel staff really cared that our anniversary celebrations would be memorable. The suite was comfortable, clean, stunning views. In-room dining was great. Colony was great for both buffet breakfast and dinner. In fact, Colony is our favourite restaurant for buffets now. To…",5,December 2016,
Forgotten about my special request,Wineglass2000,Went for a staycation in Dec 2016. I was told it was a '6-star hotel' and hence was expecting a different level of service experience.  But it was no different from the other 5-star hotels around it. I made a special request as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. But they conveniently forgot about my request. That was a big disappointment.  The room and room service was good. The swimming pool is closed for renovation and this is not informed to us earlier. The room overlooking the bay was excellent. Staff generally were respectful and helpful.,4,December 2016,
"Happy to return, happy to give 5 stars again",Yau Baby,"I keep returning to the Ritz in Singapore because this was where my wife and I spent part of our honeymoon. Last time I came, I sensed the property aging quite a bit and the service slacking. Maybe I have since tuned down my expectations. But I am happy to note that the hotel has again climbed back to being one of my favourites.  Check in and check out was easy and efficient. Service was top notch. I was asking the porter how to get to the mall, and she took the trouble to escort me all the way across the hall and behind the restaurant to the side entrance. I said it wasn't necessary to walk me through, but she just smiled and insisted. I was impressed.  The room just shows the same breathtaking view of the MBS and downtown. It's the best (or maybe actually the worst) cure for…",5,November 2016,
Still great!,zelal25,"I had not stayer in this hotel for many years but (almost) nothing has changed: this hotel is second to none.   What I like about it is: - great rooms, spacious, fabulous view - nice bathrooms with a bathtub adjacent to the window: you can take your bath while overlooking the whole city - very good room cleaning - excellent lounge - very large, modern and well equipped fitness center. Just a bit difficult to find it when you arrive downstairs...  My only reservation was that check-in was not as efficient as it normally is in Asia. I had to wait quite a bit. The other thing is that the hotel has become a bit older and the room furniture does not feel so modern anymore....  But overall a great experience.",5,December 2016,

A Long staycation @ a fantastic Hotel,VincentQ,"A 20 day Long staycation at Ritz Carlton and we already can't wait to write a good review for the ladies and gentlemen of Ritz Carlton on our first night here!   From the time the staff saw me parked my car and was struggling with the luggages, he walked towards me and offered to help me with my bags and send them up to my room. (Apology for not getting his name, but there will be plenty of time to do it with 19 more days to Go)  Then Jia Min (if my memory serves me well) from the Guests relations escorted me to the front desk and introduced the various facilities of the hotel.

Club Level is incredible service,Thomas B,"I stayed here for three nights recently and it was great service.  I love the Ritz Carlton Club experience anyway.  But this was very special.  Incredible food, unbelievable service, a great room with a bath tub overlooking Marina Bay makes for an experience where you don't want to leave the hotel.  But when you do leave, say to go running, you can expect to be greeted by someone at the front door with a cold towel and bottle of water.  The new gym is quite phenomenal and while they were just reworking the pool area when I was there, so it was closed, but when it is done it will be outstanding.  This is a great hotel!",5,October 2016,

Great property. Excellent Food!,Dinesh P,"We checked in early and they didn't have the rooms ready, but they treated us to their breakfast while we waited. It was worth it. They had a number of different cuisine sections from Indian, Chinese, Continental, Seafood, a Salad bar, desserts. The quality was excellent and everything tasted great. The Indian section has exotic varieties and traditional South Indian fare. I had a chat with one of their chefs Sugavanam and commended him on the quality. The rooms were great. Excellent views of the marina. Room service stops by to drop off water bottles and supplies. Overall - very impressed.

Efficient check-in; after short negotiations with the staff, we received free buffet breakfast for ech morning of our stay at the amazing Colony restaurant, which deserves a special five-star mention. The room itself was large, light, comfortable (see pics). I was pleased to see the parquet floors. Even though we did not get the better city view, what we saw from our enormous windows was amazing.

Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore,Arizona4Travel,"This is my 3rd time staying at the Ritz-Carlton Millenia, but this time I am giving a better review. What's the same? The extremely high level of customer orientation and service, as well as the physical quality of the property, the location and the views.  But what's better this time for the better rating? This time, I discovered how easy it is to walk around the marina bay and enjoy all the great restaurants, bars, shops, and even jogging routes in the Garden.  But what was worse this time? There was a complete closure of the pool.  That really degraded my stay, as I usually want some relax time at the pool - this time it was a no-go, and there was not a Ritz-level substitute (if they would have allowed access next door at the Mandarin Oriental, that would have worked for me.…",4,November 2016,

From complimentary tea when you are awake in the middle of the night with jet lag to complimentary (restricted) laundry. Add to that the staff in the club lounge are incredible.

Great Hotel with only minor comments,Dan S,"The Ritz Carlton Millenia is located in the Marina, a 5 minutes stroll from Marina Bay Sands, the botanical garden and 10 minutes walk from CBD, i.e. It is a great location for both tourists and businessmen.  The hotel is not the newest in town and therefore the hardware shows some wear and tear,  but nothing really to complain about.  Rooms are one of the largest in town, with a vast bathroom the size of an entire hotel room in some of the newer hotels, with both room and bathroom offering stunning views of the Singapore skyline, the MBS and a premier viewing spot for the evening Lightshow.

A belated review of the Ritz Carlton,Peter M,"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Singapore a couple of years ago and only just now have I realised I failed to post a review of it, something I normally do upon returning from a trip. This property is an absolute class act located in the marina area of Singapore (overlooking the more famous Marina Bay Sands). We did in fact visit that hotel to view it but my impression was that it was too big and impersonal compared to the Ritz, which although I would hardly call it intimate has a somewhat more intimate feel to it by comaprison. The Ritz Carlton's best attribute perhaps are the rooms, the sizes of which are pretty big for Asia and which provide views over the marina and the city (from one side of the hotel, at least). Lovely. I should mention also the quality of…",5,December 2015,

Fantastic hotel in a great location,Ru198,"Stayed here for a week on business. great hotel with a mega view across the Marina (not really a marina), but one of Singapore's iconic spots.  The hotel is well equipped, and guest rooms are really well kitted out, with floor to ceiling windows giving uninterrupted views over the city (ask for a room at the front for the best views).  The bathroom also has a large window and view of the city... from the bath! Staff are all very friendly, and helpful without being intrusive. Mega buffet breakfast in the main lobby, but you need an hour to do it justice and no plans for lunch, but there is also a small coffee shop to one side if you need something a bit simpler and quicker!   Also note that ques after 8am can take 15 minutes to even get seated... Didn't use the pool as it is…",5,November 2016,
Wonderful Experience,518denem,I was expecting a lot from this hotel and it did not fail to deliver.  Paid a premium for the Marina Bay View.  The welcome and service was beyond fault.  With small touches that really made you feel like a welcome guest not just another customer.  The room and view was truly great.  The only quibble being that a night the condensation on the outside of the window obstructed the view.  This might have been a seasonal thing.  We did find a solution which was to close the night shades before going to dinner which acted as a barrier against the cool air inside the room cooling the window glass.  On hesitation in recommending this hotel.,5,November 2016,

This is normal for most hotels, but as a Marriott Gold that has always been waived, and I am given lounge access. NOT at this property. The front desk guy very eloquently and proudly said this hotel does NOT participate in ANY rewards programs and does not recognize the gold status. He was particularly rude. I was so tired that I paid $100 to get a room right away, even though my 5 night stay had been paid through Cathay Pacific (at no discount - and this hotel's not recognizing my Marriott status had nothing to do with buying the hotel through CP). Evidently they are the only RC in the world to NOT participate in the program.  This is the reason I give…",3,November 2016,

"Great food, excellent service, friendly staff!",fanfantsai,"First time stay @ Ritz-Carlton, a wonderful experience from staff to service and facility. Highly recommend to the visitors to Singapore!!! Love every dish Summer Pavilion has provided, will definitely go back next time. The only downside about the hotel was the breakfast at Colony, though it offered quite some varieties-- western, Cantonese, Singaporean, Japanese, Indian... Cantonese dim-sum and Japanese food were not as authentic or tasty as the western food. The staff and atmosphere were great though.",5,November 2016,
Great,Johnny,"A very nice hotel. If the same price, there are a lot of options available around that area, such as Sands and Fullerton Bay hotel. Everything was good here, but isn't the most convenient hotel in Singapore",5,November 2016,
Fantastic Hotel with fantastic service,Joethomas85,"I stayed here for a month while working in Singapore, and everything about the hotel was first class. The room was spotless and comfortable, the service was incredible, with staff always going the extra mile, and the food offering was incredibly good. I would definitely stay here again.",5,March 2016,
Everything about this property is simply Wow!!!,aman_malhotra,"The property is conveniently located in the heart of the city surrounded by prominent places. A few popular places like Gardens by the Bay, Merloin, Singapore Flyer, River cruise Marina Bay Sands etc are at a walking distance. The property is beautiful and offers some stunning views of the city, The connectivity to the Hotel is really good and the Hotel offers limousine service in addition you can use the public transport aswell since the MRT station is close by.  The food options are awesome at the Hotel and the spread at the All day dining restaurant is rich, they have an Indian section in the buffet and the authenticity of the taste would put a lot of well known restaurants in India at test. Chef Suda is a real magician with his culinary skills.  All in all if you are staying…",5,October 2016,
Excellent View of CBD,guowenw,"Definitely a place worth visiting. You are warmly welcomed upon stepping into the hotel. The view of Singapore downtown will take you breath away , especially if the sunset is visible. In addition to that , there is availability of a kids room at 2nd floor to entertain themselves with various activities.",5,November 2016,
First trip to Singapore and Ritz.,Shi Lin Y,A very pleasant visit. Love Singapore and would consider to go back to Ritz. Staff were very pleasant and very efficient. We had a great time there. The location is great. Very accessible to the Golden Sand and the malls.,5,October 2016,
Disappointed with the Ritz,Stephen F,I have stayed at the Ritz before and loved it.  This time however not so good.  No early checkin as promised when I booked via Singapore airlines and latest checkout 2 pm when flight didn't leave til midnight.  Room 2511 had broken floorboards and staff were not nearly as attentive as last trip where I was in Carlton club.  Some staff on mentoring programs told us they were not happy to be in their roles.  The Peninsula in HK and Beverly Hills seem to have an edge over Ritz.  When one spends this much in a hotel they expect the absolute best certainly not broken floors and unhappy staff.  We love this hotel and particularly love the senior concierge the only staff member that acknowledged we were repeat customers,3,October 2016,
"The Ritz Carlton Millennia, Singapore",Tony G,"I experience a very personalised service at the Ritz Carlton Millennia and I want to come back ""home"" when in Singapore.  It all starts with the initial greeting on arrival, the in-room check-in, and the warm greetings wherever you turn whilst in the hotel, and the location and views are second to none, I hope you enjoy a stay here too...",5,November 2016,
Another great stay!,JoeIIe,"We promised we will be back, and we did!! The service is still very good, a staff in the lobby and I think his name is Ray, was very helpful and friendly. Both of us are  happy with the quality of food they served at their buffet restaurant, and because this is my second visit, it's a good sign. Ray made our day with his sense of humor.   Their pool is now closed, but they planned other activities. We chose to go to the pool at W hotel, and they took care of the transportation. My husband was saying we killed 2 birds with one stone. Although not ideal, we are business owners ourselves, so we understand the importance of upgrading and maintenance. Keep it up guys.   Tips!! It is not obvious they have a pillow menu, but if you ask for it, they have other pillow options. They are…",5,October 2016,
