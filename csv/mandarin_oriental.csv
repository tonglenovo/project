Nice place if you can afford it.,7,"Good location, near shopping malls. Staff are generally friendly and accomodative.","1) Checked in was delayed till 6pm as apparantly previous occupants probably have not left yet. The UFC 275 was the day before and some of them have not left yet. Was put in a resting room first while waiting for suite. Got locked out from the resting room as we decided to swim while waiting for 6pm. So we waited for 10 mins while still wet for the staff to come up and pass our suite keys.
2) Once suite was given found that the living room aircon was not cold even set to the lowest temperature. Minimum setting was 18.5 degC. Informed the reception about it and somehow the technician managed to change the settings to 15.5 degC which eventually cools the living room.
3) Toilet floor was not levelled properly, water on the floor did not flow to the drain properly creating small puddles and gets slippery for kids. Both toilet mats were eventually wet and soaked.
4) Got locked out from suite after breakfast as 1 of the door lock battery was flat and unable to enter from the other door. 
5) When request for late check out as part compensation of the late check in, they were able to accomodate BUT move to another room. Hence, that was the 3rd room my family was in throughout my 3 days stay. When asked on the reason, staff mentioned that the room was booked for later. However, I also booked the room 1 month prior but I was still checked in late. It makes you think about the difference in treatment if you are a local. I am not a troublemaker hence I accept this as I want my kids to enjoy their stay.
6) Went to pool on the 3rd day and noticed that the staff did not attend to me and my kids. Ended up taking the pool towels myself. Upon observation, noticed the staff approaching other guests willingly and assists them accordingly.
In general, if you are a local, you MAY feel that the treatment is different to foreign guests. But overall it is a great experience as the room is huge.",Muhammad,Family,City Suite King,2,"15, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]

When you are staying at Mandarin Oriental in any country you want to feel like you are staying at Mandarin Oriental. Unfortunately this wasn't the case in Singapore Mandarin Oriental. One of the biggest issues was in our last day there was water dripping from ceiling and when I informed the reception they said they will take care of it. Unfortunately when I went back to room it was still the same. First they said It was coming from the AC but then they said it wasn't which is confusing.

Exceptional,9.6,"1. The view! You can see it all without leaving your room. Our room was on the top floor( thanks for the hotel’s arrangement, which was really sweet)
2. Professional and nice service! The staff were well trained and professional with nice service and respect. The best thing you can experience in this hotel is that every small detail contains thoughtful arrangements and dosing, and it makes you feel really comfortable. That’s what nice luxury hotels should be.
3. The bed! So comfortable! Love it!
4. Love the design and style of the hotel.
5. The pool time was enjoyable! They have nice view, nice facilities and nice service! 
6. Convenient location! Walking distance to all famous sights and delicious restaurants. The neighborhood was stylish, esp the ruffle street and colonial style buildings.
7. They have cute guide card in the room to show you where to go.
8. The whole stay was enjoyable and relax. We have been to Mandarin Oriental hotel in HK and Beijing, and we had great time there too. And I think I would choose Mandarin Oriental again!","1. Maybe the main cafe for breakfast was too loud, busy and crowded, which makes you hard to enjoy your meal especially when you are expecting a cozy and relaxing breakfast during vocation.
2. Also the night bedding service could have been better. One night when we got back to our room, the beds were still a mess. We thought they forgot to clean our room. But then I saw an extra pillow in the end of my bed, looked like someone put it there casually and left. That is the pillow we asked for during daytime. So they came to our room without making night bed and left....everything lacked was not fulfilled, which was not that important. However, it felt really not good looking at your bed the way you left it - a bit messy.
3. As a member of Mandarin Oriental, the hotel offers you a free drink ticket ai M bar to their member. But they forgot to give me mine. When I asked during check out, they apologized and offered me one. I had to leave for airport and had no time using it. Kind of a pity since I do love their special made cocktails,haha~

We stayed in the City Suite and all furniture was either damaged or dirty looking from wear and tear. I am sure that they clean it, but when all lacquer is worn off and everything has scratches it just doesn’t look great. Many electrical sockets and installations are also very very old. The breakfast buffet is nice, but the Melt cafe looks like a cantina and didn’t exude any premium atmosphere either. The MO cocktail bar looks great and they serve great drinks.
In my opinion, the Mandarin Oriental Singapore is not a 5-star-hotel and Mandarin should be ashamed of themselves selling it as such for the condition the hotel is in.

When the lobby is pack they put in more staff to handle the crowd .

Even if we were to stay beyond the allocated timing . 
And when the pool is getting full , They are so well aware of the ground works that they know who have overstayed at the pool and politely request them to leave to allow other have the opportunity to enjoy the pool . 
The view is fantastic . 
Be it from the pool or the room . 
My kids love it so much . 
They been asking to go there again soon . 
Even when there issue in the room it is rectified immediately. 
Well Done to the Hotel Team .","It would made the trip a completely worth it if there is halal kitchen .

Its too soft for us but i maybe we are not used to it. But i think some people might like it.,Jalil,Family,City Suite King,2,"27, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]
Fabulous views if you book a bay view room,8,If you book a bay view room then the view is spectacular and this was our main reason for booking this hotel.,"The rooms are getting a little bit tired... And I'm afraid smelt slightly ""musty"". The robes felt slightly damp... As though they needed airing. I think this is because you obviously can't open windows to air the room. Also the aircon couldnt be turned down any lower than 18.5 and it felt a little too warm for us, we like to sleep in a cool room and although we slept OK I would have preferred it it we could turn the aircon down a bit more. It's expensive, and the niggles would matter, but the view is fabulous and probably makes up for the rest.",Janet,Couple,Marina Bay View Room King,5,"23, 2022",United Kingdom,gb,[List]

Needless to say the hotel aged unfavorably over these harsh times for the hospitality industry. Nevertheless it is still a great place without any comfort missing. My room had essential views of the CBD and MBS, which is pretty amazing by itself. Rooms size, layout and comfort are on par with the 5 star status, although I personally dislike carpet floors. I really enjoyed the pool area with its patios and yet again that great view, very Instagram-able. The staff I interacted with was welcoming and efficient.

A Breathtaking View Of The Marina Bay & The Fireworks!,10,"When booking the hotel room, I indicated that I wanted to have a good view of the fireworks from the NDP rehearsal. The staff emailed us suggesting to get a room with Marina Bay View instead of Ocean view. I appreciate the proactiveness of the staff. We had a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay & the fireworks! 
Also, when we entered the room, they left us wine/champagne & some kuih. We can't consume it so we called the staff to have it back. We didn't expect them to apologise and replace it with chilled orange juice.
Also, even though the restaurant do not have halal option, there are many halal certified restaurants and fast food outlet at Marina Square just beside the hotel. It's very convenient.",,Nurhakeem,Couple,Ocean View Room King,1,"11, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]

We enjoyed sitting outside for breakfast looking at the greenery.  Large comfortable bed.","Coming from UAE where we are spoiled with numerous excellent newish hotels, this property felt a little older and therefore the bathroom for instance is not as modern as some funkier hotels.
