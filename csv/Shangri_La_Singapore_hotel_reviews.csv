Resting on Laurels …….I will not be back,AA1463,"I visited around ten years ago and the standards of this fine company have dropped at this location. Having been in the hotel business for over 20 years the British GM has lots of work to do……… Observations on this trip to see the Grand Prix.  It seemed to be a surprise to this hotel that the largest event in the City meant it was full! One of the reasons for booking is the regular shuttle to Orchard road for the MRT. However as occupancy has been low they kept the shuttle at only 4 times in the middle of the day. This is critical when competing against all of the many fine Marina Bay properties  Worse was to follow at Breakfast in The Line…….Huge full hotel and guess how many on duty at the egg station…..ONE Chef……I discussed this with him and another colleague was away on holiday ,over the busiest time the hotel has seen in 3 years ! Amazed in a 5 star hotel no bar open after midnight on arriving back from the city …a lost revenue opportunity indeed. Saturday night there was not a single staff member anywhere to be seen including the front desk when we got back! The Pool area is nice….however the Jacuzzi is broken and confirmed to me it had been for sometime by a staff member on duty at the pool…….not very Shangri- La…..I expect better.  Anytime we had issues,there is obviously zero empowerment for the team as all they do is apologise but do nothing ….when my Bill was wrong in checkout ….3 people had to review it before amending. I will not be back on my next trip.…",3,October 2022,Travelled with family
Fantastic stay in a great hotel with great staff,graham_ward,"We had a short stay at the Shangri-la on our way to Vietnam but it beca e the highlight of our trip. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we received amazing service. The people who stood out were Yana on reception and Rajagopal, the  cheif concierge.  Yang went to great effort to find us a room when we checked in early. My wife is disabled and needed a rest but our room wouldn't be ready for some time. Yana negotiated a beautiful upgrade for us a d did everything possible during our stay to make is comfortable for us, especially my wife. Rajagopal was an enormous helper every day, giving advice, booking excursions, finding taxis and much more. I think he had the biggest impact on our stay. Our room was beautifully presented and well maintained.   It was my birthday and we were surprised to find a small birthday cake and card in our room. While we were staying at the hotel they also hosted an enormous international security conference that had a massive impact on the hotel, the staff, guests and the whole city, but staff did as much as they could to minimise impact on other guests.  Make no mistake, this is an expensive hotel, but they provide great service and great rooms. The food is excellent and the environment lovely. …",5,June 2022,Travelled as a couple
Old school hotel comfort in a garden setting,jojolovestotravel,"I had last stayed at the Shangri - La Hotel  back in 1987 in the Garden Wing and had a wonderful time.  For this brief stay on my way home from Europe I booked a room in the Tower Wing which proved to be just tight, with its most welcome and comfortable bed.   The staff are lovely and the garden setting is a big plus in a city that has grown so much.   I would definitely stay at the Shangri - La again …",5,September 2022,Travelled solo
Pleasant stay,LM,"Husband and I booked this hotel as it seemed reasonably priced in comparison to other 5 star hotels in Singapore. We enjoyed our stay here, ample space in bedroom and bathroom in the tower wing deluxe room.

Outstanding,Andy S,"We have just spent 12 days at the Shangri-La, and were lucky enough to have a room upgrade from the garden wing to the Valley Wing.  Wow, the room was large and fitted out in luxury.  All the staff were very polite, professional and welcoming.   The room upgrade is actually as it says, you don't get the canapés, cocktails etc, only the room, but it is so much better its worth it.  So Thank you to the Shangri-La for upgrading us on our retirement celebration. The pool is stunning, with lush vegetation all round, colourful birds and beautiful view's.  One slight downfall was the amount of young children running around and screaming whilst in the water, sadly parents not being considerate to other guests, not the hotels fault. We didn't eat in the restaurants due to our financial situation, but taxi's to Orchard Road and hawker centres were cheap and plentiful. This has been the nicest hotel we have stayed at in regards to luxury, whereas the Pan Pacific/Mandarin Oriental are more business orientated. The internal of the whole complex is opulent and all the small touches make it so special, admittedly we were in the Valley wing.  The gardens are stunning. We can highly recommend this hotel, rates are very competitive, but eating in is on the high side (we'll for us they are). Thank you Shangri-La, you certainly made our holiday special and thank you Sally for looking after us in the Summit Room. We will certainly be recommending you to friends and hopefully will return in the few years.…",5,September 2022,Travelled as a couple
The best x,EmY,"Have stayed here many times over the years. We love the rooms in the older section of the hotel with their large balconies overlooking the pool. Fantastic service, beautiful grounds, nice food options, great location near Orchard Road. Highly recommended X",5,July 2022,
Such beautiful elegance.,Pat R,"We were having the trip of a lifetime, and Shangri-la did not disappoint. The garden hotel certainly lives up to its name - fabulous extensive gardens planted with palms, orchids and lush borders. Our room in the Garden Wing partly overlooked the massive pool, and partly the gardens. The facilities and service are second to none and there are many in-house eating options. The staff are unfailingly courteous and nothing is too much trouble for them. I could go on with well deserved superlatives, but would just like to mention the Concierge service. Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar and his team were magnificent in booking us some trips. Any issues with the tour company were efficiently ironed out and as a result we enjoyed several wonderful day trips. Their desk was always manned by pleasant smiley faces, albeit masked, and we were very grateful for their presence. Thank you to all at Shangri-la Singapore, we will not forget you.…",5,September 2022,Travelled as a couple
Very good hotel in a nice area of Singapore away from the centre,Jon,"Excellent hotel as you would expect from this chain. Very modern throughout with good staff and facilities in the room.

Faultless,ALTamEd,"We had a faultless (near enough) stay at the Valley Wing. We like the Shangri La brand and this is one of their jewels in the crown. First class service throughout which really makes the place. Everything in the valley wing is handled with gracious efficiency and courtesy. Despite the elegant surroundings, children are made to feel welcome. We can't wait to return. Wish we could thank everyone in the Valley wing, but special mention to Valley wing Director Aris, Amin and Peggy and the conductor of orchestra John Rice!",5,August 2022,
Hospitality was disappointing,Kevin,"Booked the Shangri-La to celebrate a friend's birthday in Singapore and emailed them regarding this. Instead of suggesting recommended celebration add-ons or offering a complimentary cake (which Marina Bay Sands does), the reservations team  chose to advise me of their strict one-person limit for their standard double rooms. I was not intending to bring more than the one allowed guest but I find this reply to be very showing of what the staff prioritize.",2,August 2022,
Family resort that has seen better days,KlaudiaC,"There are lots of nice touches and highlight but the hotel has aged and a facelift is needed to bring it up to the expectation one has when staying at well stared resort like the Shangri-La. The check-in and check out process was kind, but very long and cumbersome. It’s a key area that needs up skilling and some tech efficiencies might help. Both processes (excluding waiting time) were 30-40 minutes. An area where the amount of staff didn’t make up for incompetencies. Unlike in the Restaurant, where the team varies in skill but sheer volume does cover up small errors. However on two  occasion we tried with little success to order a beer.  The food quality is fine, lots of choice. The Indian section by far the stand out. Venturing out of the hotel definitely deliveries better for…",3,August 2022,Travelled with family
Recuperation,WIP,"Comfortable place to stay for sure. My family chose ShangriLa for my father's post surgery stay, and we are not disappointed.

Beautiful hotel but NO smoking rooms despite being advertised for them on trip advisor. Avoid outdoor breakfast,monotoy,"The good:  Beautiful patio with plants and koi and squirrels. Very friendly staff. Good breakfast selection with fruits rotating over days.  The bad: No smoking rooms despite advertising them, which is deceitful and I wouldn't have booked had I known.  Avoid outdoor seating for breakfast, there are gangs of pidgeons and beos just waiting for the guests next to you leave their table to get some tea leaving their food on the table and they will make an absolute massacre of that food with one or two dozen birds, food and feathers flying all over the place. Or kids of guests will throw food to them to similar effect.  Also you'll be required to *reserve* a spot for breakfast via QR code but even doing so might end up with 30 pax waiting.

Good to be back!,KatParry,"The moment we arrived at this stunning hotel we were reminded of its tranquility and beauty, the reason we always return here when in Singapore.  The Valley Wing stands out for so many reasons, and a stay here leaves you refreshed, relaxed, and wishing you didn’t have to leave. It’s old school style with attention to detail is so very impressive.  In particular I’d like to thank Raja, always around to oversee we have everything we need, including never letting our champagne glasses get empty!

Still a favourite,traveller,First time back since covid times. Travelled with a young child and we had an amazing stay overall. We stayed in the garden wing this time and I would say it’s worth the extra for the space and view. Room is clean and well maintained. We tried several f&b outlets while staying here and all the food was good. My son had a great time at splash and buds. The normal pool is also in good condition and not too crowded. All the staff were very attentive and kind to my son and our requests were generally promptly attended to. Only negative was that our bags took almost an hour to be brought to our room after check in and we had to follow up. Will stay again!

Waited 30 minutes to check-in,Anonymous,"I arrived at the hotel at 2:30 pm and understood that the check-in time was at 3:00 pm. I do not mind waiting till 3:00 pm as I was early. 3:00 pm has passed and I asked the staff at the lobby counter about the status of my room. She informed that I have to wait 10 minutes more as the room was not ready. So, I waited 10 minutes and checked with her the second time. Again, I was told that the room was still not ready and was requested to wait further.  I waited the second time and after a few minutes, I approached another lady at the counter. Once again, I was asked to wait for a while. By then, it was already 3:30 pm, meaning to say it is 30 minutes past the indicated check-in time.

Superb Shangri-la! Thank you!,Hippyhelly,"We decided to treat ourselves to a family holiday to Singapore as a result of the Covid lockdowns. It was our first long haul flight with our 2 year old, but having visited before we were confident Singapore would be great.  After a terrible experience at the airport, where families were ignored at security, we eventually arrived at the Shangri-la and met the lovey Diram at reception. He was warm, welcoming and apologetic for our poor experience up until that point. He treated us so kindly & personally, providing our son with a little treat bag that just made our ‘real start’ to the holiday.  We stayed in the garden suite and the room was excellent.

Had to work a bit at check in to get an upgrade on the Amex FHR booked room (Shangri-La is always stingy with upgrades but generous on check in/out times).

Not what it was…,GoPlaces64393,"We stayed at the Tower Wing in a one bedroom suite for 11 nights with our two kids (8 and 10). We also had a separate room booked for the kids’ grandmother and Aunty.   We have stayed at the Shangri-La before and loved the facilities. The grounds are amazing, and the pool is simply wonderful for kids. Those things haven’t changed, but a bunch of other aspects of our stay were really disappointing.   First of all, our room was changed without any notice to me to a room in the Valley Wing. I only found that out as we came to check our booking before departure. That meant that grandmother/Aunty would be staying in a different wing of the hotel, which was less than ideal. As a result, I paid to upgrade their room category to the Valley Wing.

Valley Wing is still the best!,Anthony Yeung,"The room that I’m staying is the standard valley wing king bed room. At 500 square feet, the room continues to exude elegance and opulence like the common area of this property. What I like the most was it has struck a balance in creating such ambience without being too old-school. Yes, if you are a fan of W hotels, you might not like the abudant use of wood or this chandelier, but as luxury traveller, I found this room very comfortable and well kept.  Equally impressive is the bathroom, which is big enough to accommodate separate area for shower and bathtub.  The use of marble stone in the bathroom is very typical five star hotels.

However, after my last stay the hotel did not release my security deposit without any explanation.   It's been three months and the security deposit was still not released. From the front office there is no explanation, simply that they instructed their merchant bank to do so and ""it should be released in a few weeks"".

Disappointed,Suzanne  H,"We were a disappointed in the room and the lobby bar service at this hotel. We stayed in the Tower Wing. We had a king room. These rooms are a bit dated, and oddly configured. The bed is angled in the room, which isn’t the best use of space and made an already small room seem smaller. Also, they had slippers in the room but no robes, which seemed odd. Perhaps housekeeping missed it? There was coffee and water in the room, which we appreciated. After checking in we went down to the lobby bar for a drink and a snack, and we never saw our server again after placing our order. Found and drinks came, but had to chase someone down for the check.

Appreciate that proactive thoughtfulness. Why I was a little upset was because the room wasn’t ready, and we only finally got the keys to our room at 4pm, which was one hour after the scheduled check-in time, and yet I was denied late check-out as compensation.

The service is all smiles (even behind masks), attentive and professional. The common areas are gorgeous. The rooms are large, spotless, and well maintained. My room included breakfast, and I was amazed. The breakfast buffet offers almost everything you could think of - western, asian, Indian, baked goods, noodle bar, fresh fruits. Everything was great! My balcony room faced the street, but with the windows closed, I didn't hear any road noise. The hotel is walking distance to Orchard Road, but it's a tiny bit of an uphill on the walk back.

My kiddo fave hotel,trvkaki,"﻿ It’s back to my kiddo’s fave hotel during the June school vacation. This round we spent 4 nites at the Valley Wing.  Checking in was met with a billing issue but was quickly resolved.  The room while old, has aged gracefully and well kept. The hotel has started to stock up the minibar again but now alcoholic drinks are no longer placed in the minibar nor comes default as part of the room package. The TV was of a passable size but somehow much smaller than that of its other 5 stars counterparts. It will be more convenient for guests if there are electrical sockets at the bedside.  The bathroom was of a good size with separate standing shower and a bathtub. Toiletries were plenty and replenished daily.

Not for families with younger children,breeeyan,"Children below the age of 4 are only limited to the ball pits at buds. They are unable to go on most of the slides. Did not manage to book splash as there were no slots available. If you plan to book splash i believe you'll need to stay 2 night minimum to secure a slot due to the high demand and low supply. If one were to book 2 nights just for a session at splash it would be better to look at the buds annual membership and gain access to their pool without having to stay in their rooms. Good enough beds but way dated decor. But that is only because i was staying in the garden wing.   I believe i would have a better experience if my kids are aged 7 and above.

Cons (1) Super crowded and hotel could not cope sometimes  (2) 1 hour wait for food at first breakfast. Kitchen was overwhelmed and all the guests had to wait a long time for their food. (3) Check in was chaotic. I was told to sit at a table and be called when it was my turn but that did not happen. Other people were allowed to cut queue. (4) Check in counter staff could not help to book activities. Therefore, check in took long as time had to be spent on my phone booking each activity. (5) Room was a bit dated.

family fun,juzatourist,"stayed 3 nights with a 3 year old. Great fun at buds and splash. couldn't book some sessions online, but a call or check in-person easily settled those issues. same for breakfast at the line. my thanks to manoj for his help with a very hungry child at breakfast  restaurants were mostly full for dinner so we ate in room. table set up with chairs in garden wing room, got a high chair for the kid.  fridge didn't seem to be working properly and wasn't cold, resulting in sandwiches from the shophouse going bad.  odd that there was maintenance work at 5.48am that sounded like knocking. vacuum was going at 6.30am, so not a great night.  useful balcony to dry swim wear",4,December 2021,Travelled with family
Amazing Staycation,Liane,"Unforgettable experience from the time we arrived at its doorstep, my son went ""Ga Ga"" over the massive Christmas decor, complete with the mini train, penguins, nutcracker soldiers and completely mesmerized with the sleigh (thankfully managed to stop him in time from getting on it), he was so mesmerized that he is still talking about it & kept saying how much he misses Shangri-La.. Managed to obtain a slot (special thanks to Mia for the arrangement) for the Splash and Buds, had an awesome time enjoying their facilities, and difficult time persuading my son to go home (^_^), great, friendly and awesome team from the doormen, front desk, housekeeping, the line, lobby lounge, splash & buds.. overall experience (honest view of a 5-yrs old): ""Magical"".. thank you team (^_^)",5,December 2021,
Great staycation,ShooSingapore,"Service was good from Front Desk, Concierge, Butler, Bell Service, The Summit and Cleaning auntie. Our Valley Wing One bedroom Deluxe suite was spacious, opulent and cosy. My younger had a splash of a time at Splash and Buds while my elder enjoyed the Italian restaurant at The waterfall. Breakfasts were good at The Summit. The lack of choices were replaced with the quality of the ingredients and superb taste. My steak for 2 days were done perfectly. My hubby and I had a good time sipping on our champagne having our afternoon tea and enjoying looking at the greenery.

Great experience!,Shangkari,"I had a great staycation with my family at Shangri-La Hotel this week. Special mention to Jegan, Service Leader at Valley Wing lounge who took great care to ensure that we had a comfortable stay at Shangrila. His warmth and jovial nature is a big plus point and that made us look forward to coming over to the Valley Wing for our breakfast, high tea and canapes. He went all out of the way to customise vegeterian options for our family on certain days when we requested and the food recommendation was simply delicious! His eye for detail in ensuring that our stay was pleasant, especially with regards to food, is commendable.

Is Valley Wing really premium?,TravelgoGetter,"I believe my comments here are valid after staying for 3 nights at the Valley Wing with the family.  The good: 1.  This is a resort, self sufficient - with enough entertainment and food options so you do not need to leave the compound at all 2. The indoor playground Buds was well maintained and the play area compact and exciting enough for young kids (My 5 year old was extremely happy with it) 3. The water play area Splash was fun with sections for varying ages. 4. The chambermaid was honest. She broke a glass during housekeeping of the room. And she came by to return a new glass.  I would not have known if she didn’t return.  She was also efficient and meticulous during housekeeping 5.  The best service that left an impression was Paul at the waterfall Italian restaurant.

Good break with the family,MelvinLin,"We have stayed at this hotel several times, but the children appear to never tire of it. It feels like right now, it is one of the best places for a staycation for families with young children.  Really can't find much to complain about over our 3-night stay. Most things went smoothly and without fuss or drama, which I always appreciate greatly while taking a break from work.   The room in the Valley Wing, while slightly dated, was spacious even for our family of four. The housekeeping staff did a good job of helping us keep things neat and tidy through our stay.

Every staff we spoke to was well equipped with property knowledge, and were able to answer any enquiries we had. Any requests we had, they fulfilled with ease. Whenever we called about an issue (such as the TV being faulty), they were quick to send someone to fix it. Not only that, but they also called back afterwards to follow up and ensure that the issue had been solved.  Upon check-in, the lady at the front desk, I believe her name is Farah? noticed that it was my partner's birthday and wished him a happy birthday without any of us mentioning it.

Valley Wing Hit and Miss,LukeGiovan,"Stayed one night at the Valley Wing - the most elite of their rooms and 'club' type experience. The service was hit and miss. Hits were the older men in dark suit jackets who appear to be more senior and were jovial, entertaining and fantastic at treating the customers to a luxury experience. Then there were clearly the 'newbies' - one young man admitted it was his 2nd day and that's why he didn't know the answers to any queries - this was fine, we all have to learn but probably not great to have him train at the Valley Wing. However, there appeared to be 'intermediate' staff level who appeared confident but were misinformed and therefore made the experience quite unpleasant. We booked breakfast slot at 10:45 to 12. The alcohol beverage service starts at 11am but when we asked…",3,November 2021,

There is a bakery at the hotel and we were however very disappointed with the staff named Elsa. We have a $50 dining credit and decided to spend at the bakery. When we were at the cashier she told us that the total amount was $40+. We told her we would like to get a just one more  item to add. She gave an annoyed look, threw our receipt in the paper bag and turned to the next customer. We were shocked by such rude attitude. My 7 year old kept asking why she behaved in such a way after we left the bakery. I wished he didn't have to witness such attitude.

After giving my feedback, I received an invitation from the hotel, inviting me to come back with my family to a complimentary 1-D stay.  I took up the invitation and asked if a complimentary birthday cake can be given for my October stay because we wanted to celebrate my mother's birthday this time.

(Other families checked in later after us but obtained their rooms earlier than us). Front desk staff were not helpful and my children were both tired from the long wait. It was only 1 hour did the front desk staff even bother to offer some refreshments.   - Requested for extension of check out timing by 1 hour in view of late assignment of room. Received the generic ‘I am sorry but we are fully booked’ reply…",1,August 2021,
1st stay at Valley Wing for birthday celebration,AEL173,"It’s our first stay in Valley Wing, before they stay which I had questions enquired via email, it was answered with clarity. As it was a birthday celebration, Inside the room we were actually greeted with simple decoration for birthday & also with the yummy chocolate mousse cake (i think). We were rather surprised that instead receiving small bottle of wine & champagne since during check-in guest relation was enquiring our preference, we were actually given a full btl VC yellow label along with our high-tea canapés set. We saved it for the night. The only short-fall occurred in the room: •Cabinet at the fridge which is slight hard to open •Bathtub drainage lever was mal-functioned  Overall, it is a wonderful stay & we look forward to have more wonderful memories with friends &…",5,August 2021,
Lovely staycay - as always,fleachoo,"I love spending my birthday at Shangri-La. The staff are friendly, courteous & helpful, the service is impeccable. That’s why I choose to have my birthday staycation here each year. This year, I didn’t book my massage at Chi The Spa ahead of my check-in, so I was so happy they could accomodate me on the day itself. Doris took my call - she was so helpful & reassuring. She even arranged to have some wine & treats sent up to my room after my massage. It was such a pleasant surprise! That really made my day. That’s what Shangri-La is about - making you feel special. (I hope the therapist who felt unwell during my session has made a full recovery) It was a pity that my staycation happened at a time when there were no dine-ins at the hotel restaurants. I would have enjoyed dining in…",5,August 2021,
Surprising staff failings,Jacob,"Stayed for 10 nights, pool view garden wing, on 5th floor and 6th floor.  First issue was problem with loud baby next door and, typical front house shenanigans, they insisted there are no other rooms available despite a half booked hotel. I continued to press, I've been in so many hotels and this is just typical shenanigans, so of course eventually a manager comes out and offers a new room, there are plenty... half hour ordeal. That's a 4 star hotel annoyance, usually not at 5 star hotels.  Second issue was bell staff letting people out the main door, but then singling us out, telling us we had to go through some side exit. I called him out on it for letting other random people out main exit, and later he approached to explain he let the others out because they were not leaving…",3,August 2021,
Excellent Staycation,AngusPhua,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Valley Wing. The staff were very attentive and friendly, and continually made efforts to ensure that we were well taken care of. They were good with children and would often engage them - made the children feel very special. The all-day champagne and high tea/canapes were excellent; we liked the options for breakfast too. Raja was our favourite butler as he made every effort to look after us.   We enjoyed our time at Splash; but Buds was so-so as it catered more to younger children (probably seven and below). Overall, the playcation package was value-for-money, especially at the Valley Wing.",5,August 2021,
Great staycation,Lynn,"Thank you to Rachel and Yana for the speedy check in. We were glad that we got to check in slightly earlier at 2pm. Wenjie and Andreas was extremely welcoming.

The kids love it here!!,Joni,The kids love it here even with the heightened alert restrictions!! A family oriented hotel. Am very much impressed by the cheerful and meticulous service by all the staff from the start to end of our staycation. Special mention to Ms Yana Arshad and Elvis for their extra special personal touch that is befitting of the high standards set by the Shangri-La brand.

Covid Wedding in Shangri-La Hotel Singapore,Clinton C,"Wedding planning is a very challenging and tiring task, but with the assistance of the Events Manager Michelle, it has become an enjoyable process. From the start of the enquiry process to food tasting to multiple meetings and discussion, she is always so enthusiastic and always give the best advise to accommodate the request by the wedding couple. I still can recall during the last discussion with the couple (1st day of the returning of the P2HA), as there were more restrictions in placed and led to changes in program, but the couple wasn't aceeptive of any ideas. The atmosphere was very tensed, however she still portrayed a professional image and remained calm.  Thank you Michelle for her endless assistance from the start till the end of the wedding. I would like to apologise…",5,July 2021,
The best kids experience,hhtebaz,"During this COVID-19 pandemic, it has certainly become a hunt for the best hotel experience.   The grandiose of the lobby sets the mood for a good holiday. Ample seating in the lobby means that your partner/family can patiently wait while you get everyone check in with the reception. The check in procedures with clear instructions on facilities booking and a walk through of hotel activities/offering.   Since our room was not quite ready, a fun pack for children was given ahead of time and we were invited for drinks at The Lobby Lounge and for a mere 20mins delay in deliverance of the room $50 dining credits was offered. Service recovery was immediate, I loved their anticipation and keenness in provided the best service.  You will also find plenty of activities without even…",5,November 2020,

Bad pool experience,HannLyn,"We had a family stay and of all Shangri-La hotels that I have stayed in, this was the poorest by far. The unpleasant parts: - bad staff behavior by patrolling staff at the pool. I was rudely pointed at and told by a woman in a polo t-shirt uniform to wear my mask even when I had a drink with me near the pool bar. It’s ok to tell the guests but rudeness can never be tolerated   - after each designated hour at the pool, whistles were being blown to get the people out of the pool. We are paying guests and not at a boot camp so this way of telling guests is just not acceptable. Other hotels do this much more gracefully by their staff just giving the guests gentle reminders of the time left.  - pool lounge chairs were filthy and should have been replaced long time ago  - room in the…",2,March 2021,
Valley Wing for the experience,Isaac976,"The whole team in Valley Wing was perfect, from check-in to check out , they made us feel welcome and like family. Smiles and greeting every day. If you seen my reviews you would known that I have stayed in quite a handful of top hotels around the world.  Some how Valley Wing hits it different and made us feel like our home away from home from the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff. This is going to be a long list but it is worth it to mention all the names that have touched us throughout our stay in the Shangri-La Valley Wing.  Mr Rajiv and Mr Ono-san who helped us with our luggage and assisting us when we arrived,  Ms, Iris who made all the arrangements for us upon check in and ensured that our luggage is in the room after our lunch.  Ms Aishah for getting back to…",5,July 2021,
Fabulous family stay - staff are amazing,kerry80,"With restrictions on travel from Singapore, we decided on a second visit to the fabulous Valley Wing at Shangri-La Singapore.  It most definitely did not disappoint.    The staff at the Shangri-La Valley Wing really did make our stay outstanding.  They are so king and courteous providing such fantastic service.  The room is not the most modern, but it very big and plenty of space for a family of four.  Although you are only allowed one extra bed for one of the children, the other child has to sleep in the bed with you, or on the sofa.  The bed is super comfy and all the amenities in the room are lovely, including robes, slippers and L'Occitane toiletries.  You can also scan a QR code to make any requests such as extra bedding, towels, pillows or toiletries.  They really do make…",5,June 2021,
Very enjoyable stay at the Valley wing,Jas Y,Excellent service from the team. We found ourselves booking the next staycay even before checking out!

Memorable birthday staycation!,Shirazee Ahmad,"The staff were friendly and the hotel was immaculate.  We stayed at Shangri-la Orchard from 9 to 11 July 2021.  We had to book timings for Buds, Splash Zone, pool access and even breakfast which can be annoying having to key in our details repeatedly.. but it's understandable given the current restrictions.  We stayed for 2 nights to celebrate our son's birthday in advance. Entered the room to have a birthday card & cake for him. He even got a room call from the hotel wishing him happy birthday and if everything was ok. After having a blast at Buds & Splash zone.. of course it was perfect.  On the second day, my 4 year old son being a curious boy injured his thumb along the grooved wooden walls at level 1.

A Sweet experience Turned Sour (High-Tea),GracenNg,"Writing this without any ill intention, but just to share sincere feedback hoping that the management of Shangri-La Singapore would take my feedback for improvements.   Long story short, I ordered a Rose Veranda high tea set to be delivered as a birthday surprise to my friend late May 2021, but due to various operational hiccups which I did not expect to happen in a luxury hotel, my order was missed and was not delivered, despite myself following up with the hotel before the agreed delivery time, to which the PIC provided sound assurance that my order will be delivered as scheduled.  What was meant as a sweet surprise initially, turned sour as we ended up surprising ourselves that mishaps like this could happen with a 5 star hotel. While the team was very apologetic, a ruined…",2,June 2021,
Valley Wing - Stingy hotel charging sky high prices,Wayne,"The hotel is very stingy and not in line with other hotels in the same price bracket. I got the impression that the hotel was trying to nick and dime their guests at every opportunity and give guests the bare minimum that is promised. I would like to take this opportunity to elaboarte.   Firstly, the minibar which was complemenatry with unlimited refills has now been emptied. All items have to be ordered from room service and is chargable. If the hotel is trying to minimise guest contact because of Covid, it would be better for the hotel to stock up the complementary minibar at check in and make it non-refillable. This way, guests would not have to call room service to purchase minibar items and come into contact with hotel staff.   Secondly, The food that is served during…",2,June 2021,
best experience,Christopher K,"The stay even though it was one night, the attention to detail was exceptional. The check-in process was fast and staff attended to me while I was still in the queue and directed me on the form to fill before I reach the check-in desk saving a lot of time. The staff remembers that it was my birthday day and sent a cake with macaroons to celebrate the occasion. The staff Susan went beyond and called in to wish me a happy birthday which was nice. The breakfast was sumptuous and good.The slight disappointment was the line al-carte dinner buffet, the variety of food was limited and there was a difficulty trying to know the actual potion of the dishes base on the illustration on the phone.",5,June 2021,
Valley Wing - the place to really relax and enjoy,joyfultravel1,"Shangri-la really lived up to our expectation. The staff were very hospitable and attentive to detail. They really make effort to let the guest feel welcome. From check in to check out, every staff were great. Thank you for making our wedding anniversary a memorable one.  For area of improvement, there is just too little charging points in the room. Will be great if coffee cups can also be provided in addition to the tea cups.  We will definitely return for another stay at the Valley Wing.",5,April 2021,
The Valley Wing Experience,Tan Cheng Fan,"The rooms were excellent. It was well-kept, new and the decor came together perfectly to provide a luxurious and relaxing environment. Our family has stayed in a lot of hotels and this one truly is leading the pack. It was amazing to see 2 chandeliers in our room, an extra-large bed, and experience such immaculate & personal care by the room attendant (Cindy).  She even wrote us a note to say good bye a day before we checked out.   The facilities (Pool, Splash, Buds) were also very well-kept and manned by capable staff. Splash was an especially enjoyable and fun time for the kids.    The afternoon tea and evening cocktails included in the package were fantastic.

One staff, Raja even provided free plain noodles for our toddler’s dinner on two consecutive nights (the first night we asked, the second night he actually remembered and offered!). Cleaning staff were also very prompt. Needed to change our bedsheet quickly cos toddler spilled water right before his bedtime and Cindy got it done within 10 min.

I read some parents reviews who had their staycation during school holidays with their children before I made the booking at Shangri-La. The purpose for this staycation is for my children because I read good reviews for children to spend their activities during the school holiday.   I was quite keen to book with Shangri-La when I read that some parents were given an early check-in at 10 am during the school holiday.  But not in my case, I had requested an early check-in on Tuesday during the school holiday but was rejected through the phone. So, I followed their “rules” and I arrived at 3 pm and still, the room was not ready. I was with my baby & my child was waiting for the…",3,June 2021,

Our Go-To Staycation,blueglass22,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at the Shang which has become our go-to hotel for staycations. Since October, the hotel has implemented the Shangri-la Experience App via a QR code which we found helpful and very easy to use.  The app provides information on the hotel, restaurants and spa along with various hotel services: in-room dining, housekeeping, mini-bar, laundry, etc. This is a great replacement for the old hard copy versions in light of Covid.  We stayed in the lovely Valley Wing.  One thing that really stood out about our room was the excellent work of the housekeeping staff.  Even out of sight places such as window ledges and picture frames, had no dust! The chandeliers were also sparkling and these are signs to me of staff who take pride in their work.

Breakfast was served in the room - and the selection was broad! We had so many choices to choose from - Western, Indian, Chinese - and we were really spoilt!  Will recommend to all friends to come for a staycation @ Shangri La!",5,June 2021,
Wonderful Staycation,blurrymoon,This was our first time to Shang for staycation and I am so glad that we proceed with it even thou the restrictions were still in place. It was a much needed staycation for the kids as it was the school holidays and we couldn't travel due to Covid. The entire staycation was nothing short of fun. Buds and Splash were heaven for the kids. There were also activities such as treasure hunt which the kids get to explore around the hotel. We had in room dining for the 1st 2 days. Breakfast came in a very generous portion and dinner was great. Only some hipcups with the dinner ordering which took a while to get through but this did not dampen our spirits. Overall a wonderful staycation and the kids are asking when can they go back Shangri La hotel again.,5,June 2021,
Best Hotel Ever!,Fion L,"It was a splendid staycation! All the staffs were extremely friendly and helpful, top notch customer service. The hotel was surrounded by greenery and the feeling was extremely relaxing !  My son loves the Buds and Splash Zone. Due to Covid-19, there were restrictions on the number of guests for Buds, swimming pool and Splash zone. It was a little disappointed as all activities were fully booked upon our checked in. Fortunately, I was advised to put my name on the wait list and it cleared pretty fast! The gym was well equipped and specious, there was only a handful of guests during my visit at 9 a.m. The son mentioned that this was the Best Hotel Ever! We will come back soon...Thank you =) ",5,June 2021,
Most favourite SG hotel,trvkaki,"This is the third hotel of our hotels hopping staycation and not surprisingly, turned out to be the most enjoyable especially from the kiddo perspective.  This is also our second stay in Shang within a 6 months period; not my most preferred hotel but the kiddo most favourite. So I think Shang investing in kids friendly facilities is the right approach or business strategy.  This time round, the check in took much longer thereabout 40 mins, probably due to the complexity of my packages but I also realized that the front desk staff who attended to me is most likely a newbie. However, he has performed mostly competently.  The room, as usual, is well maintained and generally clean, except for a flattened bee found within the towel. This is a small issue to me since Shang is a garden…",5,May 2021,
Very Personalised Experience which will be remembered for life!,Shairul N,"Shangri la made the whole experience very personalised. Whenever I call the operator, they address me by my name.  They gifted my wife a birthday cake with simple balloon decoration, special thanks to Yana Arshad and team.  Despite giving me a wrong room in the beginning, they rectified it quickly and made sure the other room is clean and proper.  I love the mattress so much that I actually am considering to buy the same series by Simmons!  We had such a good time and the good experience was just unforgettable. I would like to commend that everyone working in this hotel is very sincere in giving their 100% service.

The entire experience from the staff at arrival to room services is very warm and pleasant. Pool is clean and tranquil surrounded by the lovely old day charms of the Shangri-La hotel.   Some mishaps happened between the night and next day, the house keeping team attended to us fast and tried to rectify the problem with a lot of assurance. Upon identifying the problem, the team decided to compensate us with an upgrade to their suite even though all we had…",5,May 2021,

Perfect staycation for families with young kids,Stephanie L,"I love how this hotel is especially designed to have activities for young kids (< 10 years old).

My Wonderful Birthday Staycation❤️❤️❤️,Mrs Jenny Tan,"It was a great staycation at Shangri La hotel at Cuscaden. Check in was welcoming and informative and our luggage was brought to our room by the friendly conceige promptly. Our room at the Garden Wing was spacious and cozy. It is a very comfortable room for my family of 3. We were certainly delighted by the heart warming birthday cake sent from the Guest Relations. Thank you very much! Housekeeping was great too and even changed our bedsheets and kept the room neat and tidy. Buds isca great place for my adorable 5 year old son! He had a great adventurous time there.

Staycation at Shangri La Hotel,Yenny Jong,This is the first time we have stayed at Shangri La Hotel and also to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. The checking in was smooth and the attending front desk staffs are so polite and professional. The decoration for my daughter’s birthday in her room was nicely arranged. It was an unforgettable experience for her. We are glad to have chosen Shangri La Hotel. I would like to thank all the staff and management of the hotel to let us have such a warm and memorable stay.,5,May 2021,
"Yes, it really is Shangri La",arlene b,"Time went so quickly - too quickly - just soaking in the gorgeous greenery around the hotel, the spacious room to relax in,  the pool deep enough to do laps  - and food!  Enhanced by friendly and sincere service every where - I never felt lonely.",5,May 2021,
A legendary experience that was truly noteworthy,Shao Wei,"It was truly truly an EXTRAORDINARY experience! Shangri-La Hotel Singapore embraces technology, and the use of a QR code to send requests to the hotel is such great convenience, making the stay truly comfortable. The Valley Wing all day champagne is such a winning formula - the staff were generous, forthcoming and attentive. The hotel pays great attention to detail and its impact of her customers was just so hard to quantify. One can't help but marvel at pleasant smelling orchids everywhere and the amenities in the room were just so well thought through. Keep up the good work!",5,May 2021,
Great experience!,Damien,"Had a short staycation with wife and 2 kids. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Room was well maintained and clean. Staff were always professional, smiling and attentive to our needs. Definitely be back in the future!",5,May 2021,
Excellent service from Check-in to Check-out,Craftman1,Booked a room for 2 nights for my 5 years wedding anniversary. The booking was done through 2 different platforms due to Singapore Rediscovery vouchers but the link up on both night was done easily with just a phone call. Very accommodating and friendly services. Clean room and excellent housekeeping.,5,April 2021,
Fantastic for family with kids,Yi A,"We are very pleased with the service at Shangri-La, it was meant for my son birthday celebration and we definitely felt the warm welcome from the time we check in to the room. The indoor playground and splash was wonderful for kids though we hope the duration could be longer but we understand the constraints due to Covid. Would love to be back there for a stay again.",5,April 2021,

Great family time just before no dine in restrictions,liliant,"Hey there!  I wish to express my appreciation for Shangrila team for a job well done during this difficult period. My family and I enjoyed our stay and also experienced high quality of customer service. This will also be a plus point to keep coming back to Shangrila.   I must say your reservation team is the first line of correspondence and they have done a great job, especially to Sarah who had responded in a timely manner and provided useful information.   Upon arrival at Shangrila, Mr Rajiv greeted everyone with a warm welcome and always eager to assist us. I am also thankful to Ms Sherie Han for her quick responses and help.

Family Fun Playcation was no fun,ntashaz,"Booked this to celebrate the mister’s birthday and picked this hotel over others as I was also sold by the unique kids experience - Buds indoor playground + Splash Zone. What I’d wish I’d known earlier - booking the aforementioned experiences is far from stress free.   The onus is on you to book slots on a first come first serve basis, yet being able to do so only on-site (3pm is check in which they have issues fulfilling - we got our room close to 4.30pm)   It was only through Calista’s help that we were able to at least get a Buds slot on the evening of our arrival (all slots of buds & splash zone were fully booked). However for splash zone it was not so - only the 1145am slot on the day we were supposed to leave was the earliest available to us. They couldn’t help get us an…",2,May 2021,
Family staycation at the amazing Shangri-La,katecheong20,"The staycation started with a bright spark as we were so lucky to be checked-in by a very warm and friendly Shawn Tan, Duty Manager at Shangri-La.  Shawn was most hospitable and made the start of this stay a really great one! I am one who is really big on service and Shawn is a great demonstration of what service is all about and I cannot thank my lucky stars enough to have been checked-in by him.  We love our room at the Valley Wing and all the amenities.  Dinner at The Line was wonderful too with great service provided by Bikesh and Nelson, though the Butter Chicken I ordered could definitely have been much better. The dish was really salty and he naan that came with it was already cold. The papadum was also not one of the best, many Indian stores out there would have sold a…",5,May 2021,
Enjoying the Valley Wing,YES_abroad,"The family loves staying at the Shangri-la Singapore.  Since travel is still limited to staycations for us since COVID, staying at the Shanghai-la has always provided a welcome respite.  The family themed suites is still not a a available for guests so we needed up staying at the Valley Wing for Thanksgiving and Easter break.  The rooms and suite at the Valley Wing is good for our family.  The service is great and quick.  We prefer breakfast as the Summit Room vs the buffet at the Line as we’d rather have “smaller” lists of options to choose from and not get overwhelmed with food.  Took advantage of the tea time that comes with staying at the Valley Wing and the options are good but we don’t eat that much as the family enjoys eating at the hotel restaurants from the Waterfall,…",5,March 2021,
Lovely Family Fun Playcation,lydiac469,"Had a great time doing the family fun Playcation at the Shangri-La Singapore. The room was very clean and comfortable, food was good at all the restaurants we tried (The Line, Waterfall and the lobby café) and the children’s activities were great. We took our toddler to Buds, the soft play area, and to the Splash Zone. He loved both. He also got a goody bag on arrival with toys, activities and a little pair of Shangri-La slippers. Impressively, all the staff were fantastic - efficient, helpful and most importantly friendly. I would recommend doing the Family Fun Playcation on weekdays as it seems to get more crowded at weekends.",4,May 2021,
Staycation Valley wing,Marcus,"Stayed at Valley wing, allowed check in at 1pm.

Staycation for the kids.,Corinna L,"Since covid happened we could only do staycation. We went with 2 kids. 3yo and 5mths old. The booking had some issues due to a previous cancellation but lucky for us... The hotels still had rooms. The service is impeccable. We had a lot of baggage n the rooms were not ready. A kind staff helped us all the way. As it was a long weekend, buds and splashzone were quite fully booked but they manage to squeeze us in. While getting the welcome drinks, my girl fell on the way and she cheered her up by getting her color pencils and chicken wings. It was a very kind gesture. She even informed us on the side activities like fish feeding and badge making.   Apart from this, I was unaware that only the higher end Valley wing accomodations had the squirrel mascot. As I promised my girl she…",5,April 2021,
Less-than-stellar experience in recent stays,Gisten,"This is a long review comprises of our 2 stay experiences at Valley Wing in February and April.  February stay: After a superb stay experience over the New Year weekends, we immediately booked another stay in end February under Valley Wing Indulgence package. It was just an ordinary weekend and the occupancy didn’t seem to be as full as compared to our New Year stay. However, I felt that it was rather understaffed. During evening cocktails, it took quite a long while for everything to be served. Our glasses were empty for a good 30 mins but staffs were too busy to notice and it was difficult to get their attention too. The whole feeling was exactly like our very first stay last year whereby it was mission impossible to get the staffs’ attention for anything and everything. Saw…",4,April 2021,
Wonderful staycay!,EmP99,"Utilised my SRV and it was the best decision ever!  Writing this review at level 4 overlooking the check-in counter. Waiting for my little one to wake up before we head to buds. So glad we came a day before the Labour Day weekend! Was peaceful and quiet yesterday we came and even score an early check in before noon! Situation in the lobby now is pure chaotic but we can see that staff are all smiles just like yesterday. Wasn’t able to get a later check out than noon but I totally see why!  Check in was great with Grace! She was most patient, friendly and professional. Tried to book both Shang palace and waterfall restaurant but it was full. Noting that I have a young toddler, I was extended the in room dining with my $80 credits that was not part of the deal. That was super nice…",5,April 2021,

An experience rather than just a holiday,Mr E,"We stayed in the Sangri-la Orange Grove garden wing, two kids below 12 and two of us, typical tired parents in need of a holiday.  Our experience started at check in. smooth and without any delays, it was so helpful. Thanks to Ms Adian we had a warm welcome and kids felt at home. She supported all our questions and asks during the duration of our stay and we are grateful for her professionalism, friendliness and commitment to the highest standard of care in the hospitality industry we have come across.   All staff were brilliant and very helpful and it made our stay beyond our expectations.

Extremely child-friendly; great service,louist,"We stayed at the Valley Wing last December. We enjoyed the food and drink offerings quite a bit; our child enjoyed buds and the Splash Zone very much.  Having done a number of other staycations in Singaporean hotels during this pandemic period, we are rather impressed by the overall efficiency of the hotel in handling check-ins and avoiding the nightmare queues that seem to plague some other properties.  In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to the excellent service offered by Mr Samuel Dhanraj, who had noticed that we were getting ready to leave the hotel rather early (for my child's afternoon nap). He generously granted us a late check-out so we did not have to do so, and we were able to enjoy our stay for a number of additional hours.  We plan to return rather…",5,December 2020,

Being a fellow hotelier, I was taken away by the service given by the staff.   Adian was so helpful in helping me with my booking & enquiries, Kaylee was fast and efficient with the billing upon check out. Hafiz promptly assisted me and family with our bags upon check out as we still wanted to get some coffee and walk around for a bit. Vijay then assisted with our bags and sent us off in our Grab with us feeling bittersweet - happy that the stay was great but sad that our dreamy staycation had ended.

"Great ambience but some staff were too rigid, and the old facility may not be pram friendly",siuhang,"Went for a staycay in Nov 2020 on a family package. The hotel is huge and grand, and crowded as it was the school holiday period. They couldn't give us a room so they gave us 2 complimentary drinks. However, to redeem that 2 drinks, we had to make booking for a table at the cafe, and sort of were ""hinted"" to vacate soon.   Our room was at Garden Wing, with the balcony looking over the main road. Room was a bit aged, but it was fine. The lifts were always busy and crowded. Moving around the hotel was not too straight forward with a pram, such as going to the restaurant on the 2nd floor, or the breakfast next to the pool. The splash area was great for the kids, and the walk on the lawn was refreshing. Due to safe management measures, breakfast was ordered through the phone which…",4,November 2020,

Proposal Success!,AQ54,"Dear Shangri-La,  I would like to give my highest of compliments to your excellent team that took care of me during my stay on 16th February. It was a very special day for me as it was the day I proposed to my future wife. I am glad I made the right choice of choosing Shangri-La for my occasion. Firstly, I would like to personally thank Yana Arshad and her fantastic team from Guest Relation who went far beyond the extra mile to ensure that this day will be a perfect one for me. She arranged a romantic set-up during check-in for us to begin with a great start. She coordinated well with me to have our friends come and setup the surprise during dinner.

Thank you Shangri-La Singapore,Kimmy140421,We had initially wanted to book Shangri-La Sentosa but we are glad that we eventually chose Shangri-La Orchard as we had really enjoyed our stay with you guys.   Room was spacious with a private garden. Jacqueline assisted us with check in. She was very professional and the whole process was seamless.

The Shangri La ( Orchard) - An elegant beautiful and memorable hotel .,Ken Hope B,"My wife and I took this staycation to celebrate our anniversary and was delighted with the lovely chocolate ice cream cake you surprised us with . We chose the Shangri La Becos it offered a quiet self contained sanctuary among the hustle and bustle of Orchard road - the rejuvenation was magical in a covid19 stricken environment . The facilities the ambience the Origin grill - were fantastic . And of course the great hospitality made our stay an unforgettable one .

The room was all done and decorated with flowers, cake, chocolates, fruits as we were celebrating a special occasion..Special mention of Jeghan from the valley wing summit for making us feel extra special and making super drinks for us. He surely is an asset! Also Ling Ling from the Line restaurant who took great care of our son and us during breakfast. Went out of the way to order stuff for us. She is truly a star ! The origin grill restaurant was fab and the gentleman there ordered a super customized dish for us. The buds is just simply awesome and my son loved it ! Great getaway within the city !! We will be back soon !",5,March 2021,
Very Average 5 Star Hotel,CTTan,"Just completed a staycation at the Garden Wing. The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.  Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that’s OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.  Compared to other 5 star hotels, bathroom amenities seem a bit miserly. Only bath and hand towels were…",3,March 2021,

Good experience,Clarajeanette,"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)",4,March 2021,

I was travelling with my 1 year old and 4 year old, and they had a wonderful time. Because of Covid, everything needs to be booked and our preferred times weren’t available, but we managed to work it out and get a good schedule. Buds was great (we’ve been there before as non guest), and the splash area that’s been refurbished recently was so much fun. The room was lovely (garden wing deluxe pool view), with a huge bath as well as a shower. We also ate at origins and the food was particularly fantastic, I love how they cater for both adults and kids with great food and good options. The mushroom soup was so good, and my steak was amazing too.",5,March 2021,
Most pleasant experience,Mgr04,"My wife and I just completed our stay at Shangri-La. This has been one of my most satisfying stay at a local hotel. I wanted to compliment both the hotel and the staff for the outstanding hospitality and warmth shown throughout our stay.   In our interactions with lobby/lounge ambassadors and the dining staff, it was evident how the hotel goes to the length to ensure the safety and welfare of the staff. It had certainly contributed to the motivation and dedication of the staff. They feel appreciated and as such they provide the best in class service to us in turn.

"Good hotel, but very disappointing service standards.",Muhd Lutfi A,"This is a long feedback to the staff of Shangri-la.  My family stayed here for 3D2N over the weekend.   The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.  On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers. The reason did not make sense!  After 1hr 15mins, we gave up, told…",1,March 2021,
Awesome Family Funcation,wheng_2159,We stayed for my husband’s 40th birthday celebration and were really pleased that we were upgraded to the deluxe one bed suite.   Everything was excellent during our stay. The children had so much fun with the Splash zone and Buds as well as the pool.   Breakfast at the Line was also great with the usual choices of breakfast regulars. If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived. I think there are more staff indoors than outdoors hence the delay.…,5,March 2021,

family staycation,Andrew T,"Overall, a very good staycation for the family. My child (6 years old) had a lot of fun; like to commend the crew at Buds for being friendly and helpful. There were many interesting areas to play and explore. Room was great as usual. Toilet was clean with the required amenities.   Dinner at Line was good, with my compliments to the Indian food in particular. Overall good selection of food; seafood was fresh and the chicken soup was great. Western selection (pasta, pizza and roasted meats) was a bit of a let down. Breakfast at Line was let down frankly speaking. Eggs were overdone, overcooked sausages, cold bread, bad bitter coffee from the machine, hot chocolate tasted bland, overall selection was little.

Great hardware marred by underwhelming servic,Hburn10,"Check In - I arrived on a Thursday 1230pm and there was no other guests at the lobby. The strange thing is, the doorman came to open the car door for me as I alighted my Tada and then...... immediately turned around to walk away without offering any assistance with my luggage and laptop. A rather patchy service start  My room was ready, and I was given my welcome letter stating the Valley Wing benefits. I was also given a late(r) check out of 1pm from the original 12pm. My other letter explaining the USD100 dining credit was later slipped under my door.  Room - I am all for modern luxury than old school opulence but I really liked my Valley Wing Deluxe King (57SqM)!

"Amazing Location, Amazing Service",Sh1405n,"We booked a stay at the Shangri-la to celebrate our 4 year old's birthday. They did not disappoint from the time we walked in through the lobby. From check in, we received goody bags for the children and a warm greeting not only for the parents but the tiny ones who are usually ignored. As we walked into our room, we were greeted with a beautiful display of balloons, a cake and a personalised card! During the stay, we were given access to Bud's and Splashzone for each night we were there. Our boys, thoroughly enjoyed the facilities and the staff at each station were friendly and encouraging. We would like to give a special thanks to Hafiz who was always at the door during our stay and greeted us with warmth every time.

Enjoyable with room for improvements,Muhammad Alif,"Had a 3D2N stay at the hotel with my wife and 1-year old kid.   Room was spacious and clean. Although im doubting if there should be 2 tables in the room. 1 coffee table just by the sofa and another dining table(i assume) just in front of it. The bed however was a totally different story. It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better.   The hotel is indeed family friendly with loads of facilities catered to kids like buds, splash zone and even a section of the swimming pool catering to kids. Check in and check out were a breeze.   Had the sleep been better, it would have been a wonderful staycation enjoyed by the whole family.",3,February 2021,

Much Enjoyed; but with some reservations,Alan Leong,"I had a good 1 night staycation at the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La Singapore. The most premium wing of the 3 towers; had lived up to its reputation; but with a few reservations.   But let’s focus on the positives first.  The deluxe room was clean & very spacious. A bit dated but still acceptable for those of a more matured generation. A bottle of red wine, assorted box of chocolates & a platter of fresh fruit was appreciated as with their luxury L’Occitane toiletries.   The service button was always promptly answered; despite The Valley Wing being 70% occupied.   The legendary ala carte breakfast was the highlight. It certainly failed not; particularly as my expectations were already very high. Special thanks to Butler Jega where his service at the Summit Room for breakfast…",4,January 2021,
Love the Shangri-La,blueglass22,"We spent a lovely 4 day 3 night staycation in a Garden Wing 1 bedroom suite.  We were greeted with the usual Shangri-la politeness and efficiency despite the many changes in place due to Covid. Social distancing and cleanliness were well executed and we always felt comfortable in our surroundings.  The room was lovely and spacious and I appreciated all the outlets for charging phones and other gadgets. You'd be surprised how many rooms I've come across with very few and oddly placed outlets.  With the 1 bedroom suite we were supposed to have access to the Tower Wing lounge, however, due to SHN guests in that area of the hotel, we were able to use The Summit Lounge instead. We enjoyed spending time here in the afternoons and The Valley Wing breakfast was outstanding. We were…",5,October 2020,

Children centric and possibly Chinese tourist friendly.,VenturesMD,"I seldom write reviews unless I’m extremely free, it’s 7am and I have been tossing around in bed.   Now, it’s staycation season in Singapore and many locals are looking for a getaway. Full of rave reviews here about great service and how kids are so happy here. I wish to cover something more basic or what a traveler is looking for.  The bed is firm and it’s totally reminds me of hotel beds in China hotels. The interior is old whole grandeur / resort which also is a very popular interior choice of Chinese hotels in China. Maybe because I usually book newly build hotels that are modern, edgy and hip so that I can observe new interior trends, materials and new design. This totally feels like the type of hotel my China suppliers will book for us. Feels very on the road for me.  ",4,January 2021,

Also the lobby lounge is luxurious and the service was stunning. They offer wide selection of drink menu, including champagne, cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages.  We really enjoyed our stay there.  Though the hotel is in the city, inside of the property is a totally different feel. Lots of green and pool is huge...just like an oasis in the city.

Now I understand why this hotel is a hot favorite with locals and tourists.  The exceptional level of customer service was experienced when I stepped into the lobby.  Mr Ono noticed me standing in queue and offered his assistance. He explained why it seemed crowded, how long the wait might be and suggested we wait in the nearby lounge.  I was grateful that although all the parking lots beside the building were occupied, he moved aside a signboard and guided me as I reversed my car into the space he created.

They included Mustela kids amenities for my son and even gave him a stuffed toy (squirrel) upon arrival - he loved the treatment!  The splash zone is particularly fun for all - we went there every day during our stay. Our son also loves buds and we were pleased they had a drop-off option for 4 and above - it gave us some downtime as well :)  And yes, we need to book time-slots for the splash zone and buds (the link is provided on arrival), but this was really easy and we always got the timings we wanted.

Attention to Guest at the Patio  We were relaxing at the Cabana located just at the Patio section and ordered drinks with the wait staff. After waiting for an hour, seeing them serving the Cabana beside us and not us, we were baffled and re-ordered. However, the drinks still did not reach us and we just left.   3.

Came with high expectations after reading the reviews online, hence requested for early checkin at 2pm if possible for baby’s feed time.   Checkin process was no issue but the person attending to us left a very sour taste in my entire experience as the first person to attend to us. JOVINN wasnt warm in her welcome, DID NOT explain about my booking and rooms to me, DID NOT explain about how i can book for Buds and Splash Zone.

"Worst Shangri stay hospitality by ZILA (valley wing, Jade member)",Mifff,"As a jade member i have stayed many  shangri la hotels internationally. This is by far the worst stay mainly Because Of the poor hospitality by the frontline check in staff, ZILA. As the first person we met and who attended to our stay,  she was hostile, unfriendly and unreasonable. It is the first time I’ve encountered such frontline staff, from shangri la nonetheless. Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too. This is a pity because all the other shangri la staff service was top notch and it’s A Great pity that Zila was the first person we met and unfortunately due to her, totally ruined the staycation experience.",1,January 2021,

I don’t normally write reviews but this place warrants sharing. The staff and level of service they offer are unmatched in Singapore - just amazing (a great team all round, so attentive and big shout out to Nora and Raja for making our experience perfect). Valley wing luxury and services are just wonderful.  Room, facilities, F&B, Spa are all excellent. If you are looking for a family friendly staycation in Singapore, look no further (lifeguards, buds play area, splash zone make this a favourite of all ages).

We proceeded straight to splash zone after changing and it was very fun except that there were many leaves in the water. One thing to mention is that the lady at the Splash zone (sorry didn’t get her name) is very helpful and friendly. When I went back to the locker to get my phone, she approached me and let me know how I could use back the existing locker without moving my things to another locker. I find it a very nice gesture with initiative. :)  The hotel is also surrounded by nice greenery and beautiful koi fishes and waterfall which is soothing and relaxing.

Back for renewed experience,Gisten,"In my last review I shared about the lesser-than-stellar service experience that we had during our stay at Valley Wing about 5  months ago. In response to my review, the General Manager hoped to welcome us back for a renewed experience again at the hotel. Well, we were back again, to spend our New Year at Valley Wing.  The very moment I stepped out of the car at Valley Wing entrance, I could sense the difference. I was readily greeted by friendly and helpful doorman Ryan who immediately came forward to help me with my bag and opened the entrance door for me.

Disappointing Stay at the Garden Wing,jellybellymelly,"I have had 4 staycations at different five-star hotels recently and this was the most disappointing out of the lot.    Stayed for a night on a Sunday. We only managed to check in past 4pm as our room wasn't ready - we were given two coupons for complimentary welcome drinks while waiting, and the reception was extremely polite, so that was fine. We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor with a pool view (which I would recommend that you avoid; the lobby is on the 3rd floor), but to our horror, there was a trail of ants on the table after we came back from dinner (I have photos and a video) - we didn't eat in the room and had only made coffee.

Loved their kids’ club - Buds as well. Breakfast laksa is great, but the letdown was the cleaning cloth left in the room - apparently housekeeping was in a bit of hurry! Big no no especially for a world-class hospitality brand, and haste in cleaning a room is the last thing you want especially in covid times. Otherwise it would have been a pretty good experience.

New Year Staycation,JAMEQ,"Had a 3D2N staycation to usher in 2021 from our room at the fabulous Valley Wing.  We were impressed with the vast improvement as compared to our experience of last staycation in July 2020.  We were happy that the hotel has beefed up their staffing to ensure prompt and attentive service at all times.  Despite it was a super peak period during the year end, we did not feel that the service was compromised in any way.  The other major improvement was the variety and quality of the food offered during afternoon tea and the happy hours.

Most picturesque Apartment I have come across! Great experience!,Akanksha V,"Shangri-La hotels are best known for luxury and their well appointed amenities. I stayed at the one located at Orchard for a good period of 10 days. It is as beautiful from inside as it is from outside. The balconies adorned with flowers all over, looked straight out of a movie. Indeed a picturesque property it is.  I had booked a 1 BHK apartment there. It was a spacious one BHK ever. A large dining space, an enclosed kitchenette with all necessary vessels in place, a large bedroom with a king size bed and a bathroom. Although we didn’t get the balcony, but the space was large enough for a family to survive. The housekeeping service is superb, they try to serve you at the earliest.

Excellent Experience at Shangri-la (Orange Grove) staycation,Janice Yeo,"We went for a 2D1N staycation at Shangri-la (Orange Grove) on 13/12/20 to 14/12/20. We had a wonderful time there and all the staffs who’ve attended to us were very helpful and friendly. They have all made our stay in Shangri-la an enjoyable and pleasant experience!   Kudos to the receptionist whom attended to us when we came earlier for check in and the staff arranged for an upgrade to a bigger room for us (with no extra charge). She made this special arrangement so that we won’t have to wait too long (originally we booked Garden view) for the room to be ready and hence we were able to go into our upgraded room right away. On top of that, the staff also arranged for us to have complimentary drink at The Line. Staff Nicholas from The Line served us with warm welcome and provided…",5,December 2020,
"Good, but can be better.",agc,"Thanks for the birthday cake for birthday celebration. The only disappointment is it was a Xmas log cake instead of a birthday cake. It came without candle and cutting knife.  I appreciates on the early check-in arrangement for us. But there were no welcome fresh fruits for Gold member.   The picnic basket is really special but the food from the picnic set are all cold from the fridge. There are some activities for kids, but most of them are suitable for younger kids (preschooler). Suggest to add more activities for older kids.",4,December 2020,
Excellent service even for SHN,relakz,"We arrived on 13 Dec morning after a long flight. There were many hotel staff to guide us every step of the way. It was very well organized. Check in was at one of the function rooms and was a breeze for about 14 people who arrived at around the same time. Although we were all on SHN, I don’t feel like we were treated as second class. Staff happily and patiently answered our questions. Our bags made it to our rooms even faster than us. Meals arrived on time as scheduled. They were generally nice, with some tasted better than others. I ordered some food from Grab and another delivery company and they were promptly delivered to the room by the concierge. I want to say a big thanks to all the staff who were on duty on that morning and to the concierge staff who worked tirelessly…",5,December 2020,
Superb,todo,"We just completed a 3 night family staycation at the hotel and all I can say is superb on every level. The standout was the staff. Every single staff member we engaged with was happy, polite, friendly and helpful. They knew their job, they helped solve, they asked if we were okay. It was service at a level that justifies the cost and the experience. We stayed in the valley wing, highly recommended for all the extras. The family play cation package added to the experience for our 7 and 9 year old boys. Pool access was well managed, and despite it being busy and only a 3 minute taxi drive from our house it felt like we had got on a plane and flown off to somewhere exotic, fun and fabulous. This is our second staycation post circuit breaker, and as a family we cannot fault the…",5,December 2020,
Ambience - Perfect All the way ... 😊,AI MIN,"It was a lovely experience staycationing in the Shangri-la's Valley Wing. Upon arrival, you feel like you have returned to your luxurious home. The reception by the old Japanese bellman was so professionally done. You may forget that you are in Japan. The check-in by the manager, Nora, was again done so professionally. It was like talking to a friend.   Our luggage was all ready in our room when we entered. There was a quiet element of WOW FACTOR. The view was great and the room was wonderful. Spacious and well planned room with an equally spacious and exceptionally functional bathroom, with all its defined spaces.  Perks of staying at the Valley Wing ... many!

Staycation,trvkaki,"While I have been to this hotel for a number of times, this visit was my first staycation here. We were here primarily for the Buds and Splashzone. Else we are more likely found in the main Orchard road hotels for a shopping staycation or Sofitel Sentosa for a relaxing stay.  One day prior to the check-in, I received an online check-in notification through their app and what surprised me was the incidental deposit the hotel has requested. For a 2 nites stay, I was asked to put up a $1.5+k deposit for incidental charges and this amount also included the room rate. Issue here is that I have already fully paid for the room rate a few months back and thus, why are they charging me for the room rate again? Nonetheless, I proceed to make the payment to facilitate the online check-in. …",4,December 2020,
Great For Family Staycay!,Talulladee,"It’s our first and I must say the best experience ever for the family. There’s so much activities that hotel offers and regretful that we only booked for a night. From our checked in, we were greeted warmly by Ms Calista. She is such a pleasant receptionist, whom makes us feel so comfortable in making queries and she truly anticipated our family needs. She over heard our conversation when we had to make changes on our dinner reservation when slots at Buds for our daughter timing was not available. For that, we are totally impressed and would like to thank her for organising it so well for us.

Great family staycation in the Valley Wing,Globalfilmmaker,"We had a wonderful staycation at the Shangri-la Orchard. We were glad we chose in the Valley Wing indulgence package as it really made our stay particularly luxurious. We were there for my birthday and the staff kindly arranged a free cake. We took our toddler daughter who enjoyed Buds and Splash Zone (though she was disappointed to find out that most of the water slides were for 4+). We really appreciated the outstanding service and Le Yi who served us in the lounge was particularly friendly. The massages we had with our package massages were very good.  We are vegetarian and although they had options in the lounge, it was a bit limited and they did not create additional dishes to compensate for this (as they did at the Ritz), which would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, we…",5,November 2020,

But at shangri la there are lots of activities for the little ones so would strongly recommend to families with young kids. special thanks to haliz, iflah, hyen yen. there was a filipino male staff at buds who was so nice too but i didnt manage to get his name. he was giving me advice on how to change my splashzone resevation due to the rain. my 6 yr old boy enjoyed his stay there. He got to do gingerbread cookies, play at the buds indoor playgrd and the splashzone. My son had such a great time.  My husband felt the room was too dim.

The team has put up Christmas decorations across the hotel areas and add the festive feeling to the stay. I would like to compliment New from The Line for her service during breakfast. It was school holiday and busy peak hour, however she delivered excellent services to ensure we are served on time. My 18months toddler removed her shoes without our knowings and we left the restaurant after breakfast. New took the shoes and searched for us to return.

Uplifting relaxation in the heart of Orchard,Cryptococo,"We stayed in the ShangriLa Orange Grove road for the weekend in the Valley Wing. Couples retreat option is definitely the best value for great quality including the 90 minutes massage, high tea and canapés. Not to forget the rose bubble bath my friend managed to try was also included in the price. I would highlight the super great waiter who looked after us, Alvin who is the most professional waiter and great host as part of the ShangriLa.  I would highly recommend this option to friends, families and couples. Don’t miss out if you enjoy quality time in a nice atmosphere.",5,November 2020,

Her sweet and warm disposition really made our check-in enjoyable and delightful.   2. Mdm. Jenny, our room attendant.

Valley Wing ABSOLUTE Indulgence,ellenyh,"We had the most wonderful time at Shangri-La celebrating my friend’s birthday.  We decided to upgrade to the Valley Wing Indulgence package a few days before arrival and the reservation team was happy to help with this no problems.   What an indulgence it was - we had access to the lounge with daily afternoon tea and evening canapés along with UNLIMITED Moet champagne and cocktails. In addition it included a 90 minute massage at the Chi Spa. I would say go ahead pay that extra $200 per room just to upgrade, it’s so worth it!   The rooms were spacious and clean. Bathroom was huge and plenty of wardrobe space. They had set up balloons and cake for my friend which was a lovely touch.

It was such a great experience at Chi Spa that my mum claims it’s the highlight of her stay!   The room was tucked in the valley wing, away from the main lobby. With the package, we receive tea, cocktails & canapé + all day champagne and wine and valley wing lobby. For breakfast, we decided to go ahead with The Line instead of sticking to the Summit Room (even though it was more exclusive) because we wanted a more extensive spread!

This is the most awesome staycation I have experienced! What a blast!  We have 2 young children and booked a Garden Wing room at a very decent promotional price. The room is large and clean. As we visit during the start of school holidays, the hotel is running at full capacity and hence early and late check out requests may not be acceded. However, the hotel was very kind to allow us to check in at around 2pm although the official check in time is 3pm.

Room is clean, spacious. Bathroom is spacious too, the bathtub is great for kids. They love it.  Service in Ristorante Italiano is unfriendly and food service is slow. I think they need to do something about the portion of the compliment Gelato (included in the staycation package), I don't think is very expensive to give a little bit more.

Great and fun stay for 3D 2N,22julmiyako,"Room was big for family of four with a large balcony. Booked direct with hotel for dining credits, free access to splash zone and bubs by Shangri-La, complementary breakfast provided for 2a2c and picnic experience with generous food given in the picnic basket. It was also a nice gesture from hotel allowing us to make use of our $100 per night dining credit for in-room dining to avoid overcrowding situation happening at its restaurants. Lots of fun filled activities provided by the hotel.  Tip: it’s better to book for 3D2N because it’s not as rush as compared to booking just 2d1n, to book direct with hotel rather than through klook because it’s more worth while with topping up the cost abit but you get more in terms of the range of activities and meals.

Once I entered my room I was mesmerised by the size of the room. The hotel has very comfortable, subtle styled and aesthetically built rooms with huge space which is beyond reality for a staycation room in a hotel in Singapore.

Values Caucasian guests over local Singaporeans,Mrs Siew,"It seems the hotel is stuck in some strange colonial past where it does not value its local Singaporean clientele as much as it does expatriate guests.  From the get go, we were made to feel less important. We arrived at 3pm, and while everyone else who arrived the same time seemed able to get a room, we were made to wait almost another hour. When we finally got our room, our bags were misplaced. We had to call housekeeping and repeatedly describe the colour of our bags to various individuals. This was extremely annoying given that our 2 toddlers (2year old and 1 year old) were already cranky and in desperate need of a diaper change and sleep.

Buds is the indoor playground, and the staff there were very friendly to my kids (3 and 6), even remembering their name.

Check-in took a little time, but was due to the nature of our back to back packages - but the check-in counter staff were very happy to accommodate. We were two adults with a toddler and a baby, and the combination of the splash zone and budz made it the first choice in family staycation options.   We booked the garden wing with pool view which came with a large balcony to relax on after the kids were asleep. The room itself was large, although the decor probably needs a refresh.

Mediocre service and unable to reserve dining,Rachel P,"1. As part of the package we were given dining vouchers which we were told mist be utilised during our stay. But when we tried to reserve, all restaurants were fully booked! In our experience, at least hotels like MBS and RWS bothered calling and sending out email reminders on making early dining reservation. Nothing from shangri la and all restaurants full, how did you expect guest to utilise their vouchers?  2. We had 2 day entry to BUDs for our little one. Prior to check in I had called to ask but staff insisted I needed to check in first. When we arrived, again we were told no slots were available for day 1. Since entry to BUDs was one of the main reason we chose to stay Shangri-la this was very upsetting.  3. Poor service in housekeeping staff. Our TV controller was not…",3,October 2020,
THE SERVICE!!,DrIvo77,"As an ex hotelier, I don't remember the last time I was wowed by a service in a hotel, restaurant or elsewhere. In Shangri-la, the service is so unbelievably consistent throughout the property and everyone genuinely wants you to enjoy your stay. We have chosen the Valley Wing for our 2 night staycation with my daughter and we'll never forget it. The beautiful lobby, red carpet welcome by amazing Nora, gorgeous room and facilities. The breakfast, high tea, canapés and drinks throughout the day were all included in the package. It was all served in the Lobby or the Summit room. The Lobby atmosphere brought me back a few decades, the old class service, elegance, even the uniform resembles how it used to be. And I loved it. It was Edwards' kingdom down there, he makes that place…",5,October 2020,

A great experience!!!,TRAVEL_WIZARD,"I loved my first visit to the Shangri-La in Singapore. It was after I visited the Shangri-La on Sentosa that I decided  I would like to try the one on the Orchard road. In the process of my move to Singapore, I stayed in the serviced hotel and that was fun because we could visit the swimming pool at the main hotel. The frog pool was a small outdoor water play-area the first time I visited but now it has evolved into the much bigger Splash Zone which has a pool, water-play pirate ship and more things to play around on. The staff who operate this area are lovely and my little brother made friends with them easily. This new area has brought in a new membership where you can visit splash zone whenever you want! When I did this we got $250 to spend for free and A reservation at the…",4,September 2020,
Most memorable birthday staycation!,Ella,"My family and I had the greatest time celebrating our birthdays at the Shangri-La Orange grove. The hotel, facilities, decoration, and atmosphere was beautiful. Safe Distancing, safety, and health protocols were carefully monitored and followed. More than that, the service was impeccable. All our needs were anticipated and taken care of which made us feel so special, despite it being such a huge hotel.    Mica, our Asst. Guest Relationship Manager, absolutely knocked it out of the park ensuring that we had all the necessary reservations and that everything was in order to make this the most stress-free, enjoyable, and memorable weekend! A few shoutouts to Noel, Benjie, and Raja who made us feel at home in the Valley Wing!   Kudos to the Shangri-La team for making this a…",5,September 2020,
Perfect staycation,wesleywaisiu,"The staycation with the young kids at Shangri-La is superb. The family package includes 100 dining coupon per day and play time at the bugs-indoor playground and the picnic box (with a lot of food inside)  It’s also during school holiday, with some additional kids activity and dinosaur theme decoration at the lobby. The new water playground is also very good.   The breakfast buffet is change to all-you-can-order. But it’s ok. Also arrange a birthday surprise for the kid and the decoration in room is nice with a cake and a hand written birthday card.   We stayed at the corner room of at Garden Wing. The view of the swimming pool is great with a huge balcony. The room itself is also very clean and they I provide the sanitiser kits for the guest as well.

Staycation with Family!,scartay08,"We stayed for 3D2N. The room is great, very spacious and comfortable. It was my birthday and I got a cake waiting in the room!❤️    We didn’t get to go to splash zone because the slots that we wanted were already full. It was Phase 2 in Singapore so the number of people that can get in is limited. We get to use the main pool though and my kids still enjoyed our stay!  The only downside is the food. Breakfast was the same everyday and the taste was average. I guess I just expected more from Shangrila. We also had In room dining and even that, the food I would say is not worth it. We stayed in Shangrila sentosa before and the food there was better.    We will still probably come back here after Covid is gone.  ",4,September 2020,
Great Staycation,jadezty,"Very patient staff with good customer service. We stayed for a 2D1N deal from trip.com for my birthday and upon notification the service team arranged a complimentary cake and with availability, an upgraded room to garden view too. The deal came with usage of Buds for the kids and it was such a fun time - definitely one of the better indoor playgrounds we have been to, sans balls and seed pit due to covid. Restaurants were a tad pricey for local grub and had large portions but service was TOP notch all the way, very catered to a family with young kids like us. I would recommend room service which is more affordable and in more comfortable portions if you have to dine in with kids. Bed was large but a tad hard though room was spacious and baby cot was nicely lined and had a…",4,August 2020,
Splashin’ Time @ Shang !,BullishBear,"Kids (9 & 11) and parents (42 & 44, hehe) each / all had a fantabulous time !

P.s.   - All staff @ Kids Splash Zone (especially Kor Kor Maurice) were truly truly MVPs !  - Breakfast @ Summit Room (Valley Wing) is unmatched here in SG ... the “Bikini sandwich” blew my mind !  - Beware though of the $3 per piece of “mantou” (the small type one) when ordering extra for your chilli crab dish at the Lobby Lounge ...

Lunch buffet experience 27 Aug 2020,649ycl,"Due to COVID-19 situation, ala carte buffet style.   1. Unfortunately, it's not senior citizen friendly. No hard copy menu for them. Should provide disposable ones for the elderly who are not very good with mobile phones and who cannot see phones clearly.  2. Too few staff. 3. Although staff claimed that we could customised orders, none of them came right n as requested.   4. Food standard had dropped dramatically. The amount paid is not worth.   I personally think the restaurant is not really ready to serve buffet right now.   And  I will not go back again until they return to normal services.   2 commendable staff that helped save our lunch experience. - Ling Ling who was very patient and understanding.

Extremely Poor planning of Dine & Splash,3buns,"We are extremely disappointed at the planning and the arrangement of dine and splash package. My daughter’s birthday celebration was ruined as a result.  We’ve booked dine and splash for my daughter’s birthday 3 weeks in advance and she’s been looking forward to it. On Aug 23, when we arrived at 10:25am, both pool and splash zone were full! We were put on a wait list of the splash zone with about 8 families in front of us. We complained to the splash zone staff that we’ve paid and booked in advance and was surprised that we had to wait. The staff only replied “the government only allowed 50 people into the splash zone, and it’s not up to us. The guests can stay as long as they wanted to until 6pm. This is beyond my control”. How the staff replied was definitely unprofessional.…",1,August 2020,

Immaculate - Top notch service and experience,Kuromi_26,"Had a chance to celebrate a friend’s birthday at The Shangri-La. Stayed in the Valley Wing which is the more “exclusive”. If you love old world charm and classic 5 star hotels, this is for you!   Chandeliers and fresh flowers are everywhere in the valley wing. I can’t imagine how much effort goes into maintaining such perfection. Although everything is classic design, all is spick and span with full attention to details.   The room has a nice living area, dedicated vanity table which I love ❤️and a huge marble bathroom.  A generous fruit platter, Nespresso machines, soft drinks and fruit juices and tea - with a Wedgewood tea set is included. And also a care pack with masks, sanitizers and hand lotion for going out.

Old world luxury at its finest,Klaus Schwab,"Booked the Valley Wing Indulgence package and it was the most luxurious staycation we've been on.  Firstly if you drive, you may choose to park at the Valley Wing side, and it's like a private carpark that you'll appreciate the proximity to the Valley Wing lobby.  Perhaps it was because we stayed during the National Day long weekend, there was a crowd at the Lobby Lounge when we went down for afternoon tea and cocktail/canape. Afternoon tea was a nice selection of pastries, sandwiches and scones, paired with a palatable champagne - Veuve Clicquot. We really loved the scones (with real good clotted cream and jam), and glad that the team could provide a 2nd serving of the scones.  Cocktail/canape was a little disappointing. There were only 5 canapes for each person, and a limited…",5,August 2020,
Best staycation so far in Singapore,Laurent P,"This is the 3rd place we have been staying for few days in lieu of our overseas traditional destinations. I was not sure about the location as Sentosa is more attractive for a change but I do not regret my choice. Very convenient experience at the pool, excellent food in all the restaurants including a great breakfast. Interesting grill in room formula or picnic basket in the garden. Service was much better than many other 5 stars in Singapore. Here they engage professional individual for most of the staff. Guests with little ones can enjoy the splash area and the kid's club.  Well done!",5,August 2020,
Staycation during Covid-19,brnrd_h,"Despite Covid-19, I did enjoy my staycation though there is restrictions on facilities' uasge and no buffet foods ' spread. I was heartened by good if not great services by hotel's staff;  Samuel, Govind, Zila , Iris,  Anjan and Chef Carolyn, Thiagu. Also Doris from Spa, sales staff Dekura and Travel Reservation Team of Murni, Wei Qian and Poh Gek. They were friendly, helpful and served with passion and smiles. I was particularly impressed and appreciated few hotel's staff who stayed behind to help to find my niece's engagement ring in the lift at 10th floor. I didn't ask for their names but they were very helpful and patient. It happened on 9 August Sat 6.30pm at 10th floor. I am sure I will be back soon. Indeed an eventful and enjoyable stay.",5,August 2020,
Great service and value,Benjamin G,"Booked a stay under the valley wing indulgence package.

Checking-in at Valley Wing lobby by Ms Iris was swift and prompt. She had also helped us with booking our massage with the spa on the spot. Room was spacious and we got a nice pool view.

Staycation at Valley Wing,JAMEQ,"Not able to travel due to COVID-19 outbreak worldwide, I'm happy that Shangri-la Singapore has offered some staycation packages and we have delightfully opted to indulge ourselves with a weekend stay in the Valley Wing.  Not sure whether it's because we are locals staying in a local hotel or now it's during COVID-19 period and services have to be somewhat compromised, the level of service falls short of my expectation in few areas.  Guests recognition is lacking as compared to my stay at Horizon Club Floor at many other Shangri-la properties.  It makes my even more appreciative of many overseas staff who were able to remember the guests' names.  We had breakfast at The Summit Room which is exclusive and happy with the ala carte menu.  The only let down was that nobody cares to…",4,July 2020,

The location is in a business area,  so very convenient walking to the shopping mall. It is about 10 minutes via Grab to the marina. ",4,December 2019,
Amazing!,Chumbawamba,"Can't fault this place-sublime facilities and staff. Can't wait to stay again. The service and food were second to none. I am so impressed with the way they looked after us.

Nice Comfortable Stay during my SHN,Clear_Brook_Rae,"I stayed here for 2 weeks serving my Stay Home Notice quarantine.  I can only comment on the deluxe room which is classic clean, spacious and there is an idyllic greenery scenery from your writing desktop table to zen out.  The king size bed is definitely a good excuse for slumber most of the time. The bathroom has a roomy shower and bathtub (yes! not many hotels have this feature nowadays).   The meals are well planned, wholesome and healthy except for the daily soft drinks which it is a welcome treat at times.  The only down side I have is the laundry service which is definitely not recommended.  My clothes are all badly crumpled and I have to figure out how to retrieval them.   Nevertheless, I have to highlight the special touch - the daily app card and weekly programme to…",5,June 2020,
Great room but there are better hotels in Singapore,HHM95,We stayed in a Horizon Club deluxe room - was modern and comfortable with an excellent view. The hotel is ideally situated and great for those who enjoy a walk.  The newly updated HC was well refurbished but large and overcrowded with people and screaming children. It felt like we were in an airport lounge and we fighting for a table. The food and beverages were average at best; some of the red wine not even drinkable. The staff are friendly and efficient but sadly when the space is at full capacity at most times of the day - it doesn't really matter.,3,December 2019,

On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised with the open, inviting decor and atmosphere.  The check in procedure was prompt, pleasant and professional. The space is beautiful, especially for a city centre property, although our autistic son did struggle with the way sound travelled around the space (This is unavoidable because of its design but we were able to avoid further distress as after the initial check in we used the Club lounge service centre).

Although the children's outdoor area was under construction, the hotel staff made sure that the pool area was brimming with help every where you turned. The pool was clean, and the pool chairs and towels were the comfiest I have ever experienced.

In fact, throughout our stay the whole team at reception could not have been more helpful and were outstanding throughout.  We were given a corner room on the eighth floor of the garden wing and could not recommend it higher – definitely one of the best rooms we have had anywhere.

The quality of the rooms, the service, the facilities and of course the amazing staff, made it a totally memorable stay.  The staff were totally discreet and yet always helpful. Nothing was too much for them to advise, arrange, or help with. The rooms were immaculate, as were their enclosed gardens!

I’m in on night 4 and will be checking out tomorrow, and still nothing has changed my mind about ever coming back again. Says a lot since this is our third or fourth stay with Valley Wing, and we used to love coming back to the welcoming environment and great team.

Used to be the best in the world - not now,Roger P,"My wife and I have stayed at the Shangri-la every two or three years since 1987.   For many years, it was the hotel of choice for professionals, especially when staying in the Horizon Club.   For the extra cost, one got excellent well-appointed rooms, and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas  On our recent trip, we found that the room had been redesigned, probably by someone who had never stayed there.  The bathroom is smaller, with the shower in a so-called wet-room area with a slippery floor, which could be dangerous.  A former feature used to be the full size bath-tub in which one could relax,  but this has been replaced by a small steep-sided one which is difficult to get out of.

What was great was they found out it was for a birthday, and had the room decorated beautifully.  It was great!  The staff were warm and friendly.  And very helpful.

Amazing Team!,SueFlakes,"Our little Poppy’s Birthday was during the peak of the COVID19 pandemic. All the bookings that we’ve made were cancelled by the venue one by one. And to TOP it all off, we weren’t able to cancel the cakes, decorations and favours that we’ve booked. Shangri La was a last minute booking, and it was the best decision we ever made!  The Customer Service team, led by Yana were amazing. First and foremost, she was successful in making a hyper stressed up mum feel settled and assured that her princess is going to have a birthday she would remember. And the team at Shangri La delivered!   Right at check in, Yana and her team made Poppy feel really special welcoming her with little squirrel plushies and goody bags. The team went above and beyond, decorating our room for her surprise.…",5,February 2020,

Great start to a holiday,Kevin C,"Arrived at the hotel during the coronavirus period and were reassured by the diligence and attention to detail from the staff with respect to control measures.  The reception staff warmly welcomed us and processed us very quickly to our rooms.  We stayed in Horizon Club deluxe rooms and they were very comfortable and clean rooms.  The bathroom facilities were excellent with good quality toiletries.  The Horizon Club was just what we needed after a flight from the Uk and it really was our home for the three night stay.  The quality and variety of food and drink available for breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner was very good.  Don't be put off by the location as it is only a 15 minute taxi ride to the bay area and a 5-10 minute walk to the shops on Orchard Road. Thoroughly enjoyed…",5,February 2020,
Best start to a holiday,Rachel H,The Valley Wing was stunning. The staff could not to enough and the gardens are beautiful. Rivals the Sydney Shangri-la as my favourite hotel. We will come back if we can and will certainly choose this above other places to stay in Singapore,5,February 2020,
Overnight stay,Grsomers,"Was recommended to stay in the Valley Wing and cannot fault it, Staff were 5star from the time we stepped out of the taxi till the time we left Facilities again 5 star & the lounge facilities superb and fantastic relaxing stop.  So would highly recommend  Maybe a little far back from the main attractions but easy walk to Orchard Road & shopping. ",5,March 2020,
Fabulous,archieNottingham,"Into our third day at this fabulous hotel. All the staff are courteous, helpful and happy, this makes a real difference to your experience. The hotel itself is lovely. We are enjoying the Horizon Club which is great, a very nice private lounge with plenty of variation in food and drink. The pool area is also a pleasure and welcome in this heat. Singapore is fairly quiet at the moment as you would probably expect but suits us, no queues, no hassle just relaxed. Definitely recommend this great hotel.",5,February 2020,
Lovely lounge,mother00,We stayed here for 4  days just at the start of the corona virus outbreak. The hotel staff were extremely conscientious at checking our temperature. We stayed on a club floor and the lounge was fantastic. The staff very attentive and the food fantastic,4,February 2020,
Excellent buffet meal,RogerRoger2,"Enjoyed a wonderful, extensive range of food yesterday evening. Super quality, as ever and beautifully fresh.

Great hotel,annbaines287,Lovely hotel and lovey staff. Due to corona hotel and attractions relatively quiet but lots of monitoring in place both in the hotel all attraction and shopping mall. Hotel quite expensive for food and drink but there are restaurants within 10 minutes walk.,5,February 2020,
Wonderful pool and club floor,dbshuron,We loved our stay. The pool is beautiful. The pool and hotel staff are very helpful and welcoming. We were upgraded to a room with club floor privileges.

Wedding Anniversary,TeamH,"We had stayed at Shangri-La Singapore Orange Grove for few times but this stay was the best. The Asst. Guest Relations Manager, Mica Villasenor surprised us with cake, balloons, flower petals and swan decorations to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary at our room. We had a very special private dinner celebration at The Orchid Diner de Fleur inside Shangrila by Chef Hun. He prepared a very exquisite 5 course set menu that really set the tone for the wonderful evening. Not to mention,  we were pampered by the great service of Steven.  We had never imagined that there is an enchanted place at this hotel. We highly recommend to stay at Shangrila Singapore. ",5,February 2020,
Birthday Staycation,lon9b3an,"Going beyond our wildest expectations. The Magnificent Shangri la team made our stay sweet and memorable. Requested to celebrate my wife’s birthday with a cake delivered to the room saying I’ll pay for it but they offered it with compliments! Breakfast at the line was wonderful and had so many selections, even the fussiest diner would be spoilt for choice. Our time at the horizon club was awesome and the place exudes class, definitely be there for the afternoon tea selection and the evening canapés ! The hotel itself is also magnificent and there are so many things to see within it itself! Won’t spoil everything, you have to stay to find out! Shangri la hotel Singapore definitely ticks all the boxes of excellence in my list! ",5,February 2020,
A delightful gem in the city,peilin_ca,"My husband and I spent two nights in the Garden Wing. We absolutely love the experience. Even though the hotel is in the middle of the city, it felt like being in the botanical garden. The ground was well kept. The public areas were stylishly decorated and one could see that there was great attention to detail. The hotel staff were very courteous and friendly, and they seem to always know what we need. Our room was amazingly quiet and we were able to get a good night’s sleep. We highly recommend this hotel!",5,February 2020,
Forest paradise in the middle of the city,tvainio,The breakfast buffet was the largest we've ever seen.  It's just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service.  You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there.  Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room.  One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away.  The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There…,4,February 2020,
Service with style to match!,spaqueen12,"My husband and I recently stayed five nights in Junior Suite at the Singapore Shangri-La.  Despite the corona virus scare, they handled themselves in a professional and secure fashion.  We sampled the lobby restaurant and Shang Palace and had fantastic meals(Peking Duck was the best in Singapore).  Special thanks to Zoe in the Horizon Club for making our stay memorable!  Their entire staff, from check-in to check-out were superb.  Great location, 10 minutes to Orchard Road, and all the shopping you would want.",5,February 2020,
You cannot beat the Shangri-la experience,Elmo1989_03,"We were here for 1 night for the last leg of our honeymoon and wow what a way to end the trip. We were blown away by the lobby and the beauty of it. After a temperature check (in light of Coronavirus) we were given a complimentary chilled smoothie and a free upgrade to a garden room for our honeymoon! What an incredible room it was with flowers, a card, a towel swan on the bed and a chocolate cake sent to the room for us!  The bathroom had the usual complementaries and we enjoyed the shower. My husband said that the gym was fab and the pool was huge and relaxing. We went for a wander around the hotel and it is stunning especially the waterfall and coy carp/turtles!! We loved The Line restaurant for the lunch buffet and to be honest, cannot fault this hotel. We only wish we could…",5,February 2020,
Amazing hotel,nutmeg2000,"We were amazed at everything at this hotel, from the exotically dressed doorman who was so very helpful getting all our heavy bags out of the Uber, to the very friendly front desk, and the beautiful infinity pool sculpture they have in the lobby.  We were even given orchids as we were shown to the elevator!   There is a beautiful little garden area with a small waterfall and pond with koi fish.  Everything was absolutely five stars all the way.  I'm so glad my sister's friend recommended it to us!   We did not do the breakfast as there are so many wonderful places to eat for very little money in Singapore.

Disappointing experience,A. Au,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel with our 2 grandchildren, twins aged 3, together with their parents and maids, checking into 3 rooms of their Horizon Club.  The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed.  The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a…",2,February 2020,

Very luxurious,Andree H,"We stayed here 1 night, a stopover on our way home and disappointed we weren't there longer.  Will go back and explore more of Singapore.  I had the unfortunate incident of losing a purse in a cab, and the Hotel was very helpful in tracking it down.  Fabulous customer service, could not recommend this place enough ",5,May 2019,
Very Impressive but ....,DDD999,"The brand Shangri-la has always lived up to its reputation, and this one is no exception but there are a few rough edges during our short stay here last Christmas.  Check-in was a breeze, and the room was probably one of the finest available in the 5-star category in the whole of Singapore.  No disappointment there.  When we wanted to get a quick bite on the night of our arrival, the Shophouse patisserie proved to be our first surprise.  Not only was the shop assistant unfamiliar with the range of their pastries and cakes available, she was also ill at ease at answering our questions on them.  Granted the products on show seemed attractive enough but without proper introduction/recommendations, we had to settle for a couple of donuts (which were delicious).  As a member of the…",4,December 2019,
A-LIST HOTEL,CC672019,"We stayed in Shangri-la Hotel for 5 days. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooms were modest and clean. It's a 15minute walk to shops and restaurants. Breakfast was from 6am to 10am. They had to take our temperatures before we could enter the breakfast buffet area because of the covid19 scare. We didn't mind, it's a safety measure for all the guests. There is a wide variety of food and it was sumptuous. Thank You Shangri-La for the wonderful experience. We would surely stay here again, 🥂 cheers!",5,February 2020,
Waterfall Restorante Cafe,Lyn Lyn Peh,Best place to chill as this restaurant is away from the main lobby and is quiet too. Good place for a small gathering and prices are very reasonable.

Nice hotel with some but...,Arturs-PL,"I stayed with my family 3 nights in January in tower part.  We liked room, which was nicely equipped, clean, silent and modern. Foyer elegant and inviting. Friendly staff in all places. One aspect for the consideration - breakfast.  Good selection, but really crowdy in the morning (hotel is huge) and with 'cheap ambience/furnitures' like from simple holiday resort and not 5 start hotel, which belongs to one of the most prestigious chain.",4,January 2020,
Fabulous!!,Ashwell4,"Stayed only one night as had been visiting family in Singapore. Although incredibly busy when I arrived, I was immediately welcomed and escorted to check in which was welcome and friendly. Because of the Coronavirus, additional health checks were in place and all were carried out in a courteous way. Despite being lunchtime , my room was ready -18th floor with marvellous views from the large windows and beautifully appointed. I loved the horizontal safe - so much easier to access and a vanity unit with mirror and hair dryer - designed for female guests! The pool is large and plenty of sun loungers and attendants were quick to assist. I had a fabulous foot massage poolside - thank you Noor. I also enjoyed a facial treatment in the wonderful Chi Spa.

Wonderful hotel,Charlie W,"*INVITED TO REVIEW*  I visited for the first time this week and truly enjoyed my stay. I stayed in the Valley Wing which is elegant and secluded.

Great stay at Shangri-La,Alexandra D,"A bit late, but better late than never!  Three of us stayed here November 2019 in the Horizon Club Junior Suite, which gave us access to the Horizon Club, and included breakfast. I highly recommend the upgrade to Horizon Club, it's pretty handy, and makes check in and check out extra quick and easy.  The hotel itself is fantastic, with very well maintained grounds, big pool to relax at (treat yourself to the poolside massage), and perfect location; within walking distance to ION Orchard, and the MRT. The room was immaculate; spacious, with an enormous closet, little kitchenette, sitting area and a big washroom with all the amenities you could possibly need during your stay.

"Great hotel, but location and other issues",Thomas A,"This is a great and elegant hotel, but I could not rate it 5 stars because I did encounter some issues.  The first room I was assigned which was a pool side facing - a non-smoking room - actually smelled like cigarettes so bad that I asked for a room change (I am allergic).  The second room which was supposed to be a King Size bed was a room with two single beds pushed together not pool side facing, but finally the third room was what I had expected....King size, Pool side facing.  Location is good....close to Orchid Road after a little walk but the main areas were a bit distance.   A nice hotel overall but not 5 stars based on my experience,  As a side note, however, the staff was great...helpful, and friendly.

It was a decent King bed room and plenty of drinking water which gets replenished on a daily basis. There were also a couple of apples left daily.  The hotel is slightly away from the city but we could move around easily by using MRT and it is so cheap to purchase the tickets. Breakfast timings are pretty decent from 6.30am-10.30am.

One of Singapore's best hotels,pd7,"Had a wonderful stay at Xmas. Service was excellent, breakfast was expensive but there was a superb choice of all kinds of cusines, lovely well-kept gardens, plenty of quiet areas around the hotel. Quite well located for Orchard Street and the Botanical Gardens although in Singapore's heat both are a little too far to walk to. Well away from the River, Chinatown, Little India & Marina Bay so you'll need a taxi or Metro to get to those places. We were not happy with the hotel's shuttle service to Orchard Metro station - there was only 1 small bus (minibus) an hour and this was woefully inadequate for the number of guests queueing for the service - that really must be sorted out! Needless to say drinks at the bar here were very expensive too. Overall, however, a very good place to…",4,December 2019,

We stayed at the Junior suite with access to Horizon Club lounge which was a nice escape from the crowd that started filling the hotel over the Chinese New Year holiday.   Due to corona virus outbreak we decided to extend our stay and duly booked our 2nd week of stay 4 days in advance. I also checked with the counter staff to confirm that booking through the app would give us a better price. We did a price check on the app later to find out that if we had made the booking just 1 day earlier, we could have saved $550 off the reservation. So no savings for booking in advance.

Stunning hotel,Clair&Dave,"We have just returned home from a 4 night stay in the Valley Wing part of the hotel and all I can say is wow. The Shangri-la is a beautiful hotel with exceptional staff who go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The Valley wing perks were incredible. We enjoyed afternoon tea, delicious canapés every evening and a variety of drinks throughout the day. The gin trolley was our favourite. Our room was spacious and had a lovely view out to the gardens and the pool. They decorated it for me for my birthday and had a little cake for me. Breakfast was also amazing and there is a large variety to choose from, all freshly prepared for you.  Please explore the grounds as there is a large variety of Orchids growing around the gardens.

Still amazing,Dullardd,"I’d stayed at the Shanghai-la hotel in Singapore about 10 years ago when visiting Singapore for work, and was incredibly impressed with it then. I’d spoken so much about it that we decided to make it one of the locations for our honeymoon. And it totally lived up to expectations. The staff are beyond polite and helpful, the service is absolutely top class, and the food and drink offering is excellent. Perhaps I preferred the old bar that used to be at the top of the Tower Wing, but the new Origins bar off the lobby was a very pleasant place for a drink, and had a great range of drinks.  Any negatives? One, but it’s so minor - mid morning, they put a lane line across the pool to separate the deep end from the rest, which makes it a bit harder to swim lengths.

"Hotel is great, but block booking sucks.",Willy C,The hotel facilities and staff are great. But doing a block booking for a seminar for overseas visitors was not as smooth as I had expected. I had chosen Shangri La based on my past great experience staying there and was disappointed with the standard of the booking system that I had to intervened on behalf of my overseas guests. I had envisioned that once the special booking code was allocated all my guests would be able to do their own bookings. Unfortunately there were hiccups along the way and I was embarrassed after having informing them this is one of Singapore's best.Luckily once everyone arrived the seminar proceeded well.,4,November 2019,
A green oasis in the centre of Singapore,AnnakTU,"This hotel is situated in the centre of Singapore but it is surrounded by so much greenery you tend to forget. It is an excellent property, very corporate but also have a wing more suited to the leisure travelers. The rooms are spacious and contemporary in design, all mod cons as you can expect. Excellent bathroom with walk in shower and a bathtub. The breakfast is fantastic you can pretty much eat your way around the world. The gym is a good size for a hotel gym and the spa has several treatment rooms. There are plenty of excellent meeting rooms and private dining opportunities.

In love,Zane Carmichael,"Oh what a hotel.   The staff is amazing, the amenities are amazing, the benefits if you have Amex FHR is amazing.   Most importantly they are true 5 star service. This being as I have an allergy to garlic and onions and even so called 5 star hotels refuse to make certain things without garlic and onion as it’s “pre done.”  They have specially catered to me which is a major plus beyond measure.   They have many restaurants, a barber on property and so many amenities. If you have Amex FHR they don’t just give breakfast complimentary but also afternoon tea.   I could immediately know this hotel would knock it out of the park for me.  Thank you ",5,January 2020,
"The height of luxury,without ostentation",Fraser A,We stayed here for the New year. We were not disappointed. We were offered a room in the Horizon Club set. As we were on BandB basis this arrangement worked superbly for us. We were able to fill the day without stopping and then relax in the Club lounge  With complimentary drinks and canapés while deciding on Dining venues. Hotel immaculate. Food top class. I don’t believe we shall ever stay any where else in Singapore. Well done to all the staff,5,January 2020,
1 star in service,Phillip,This appearance of this hotel was grand. However the services from check in and ALL the restaurants were AWFUL! We would get our main course before the appetizers. Our kids food would come out last. The waiters would forget to bring certain plates.. We had to make several reminders to waiters inquiring about late plates. Mind you asking for ketchup and waiting for it the length we did was noticeable.  Really sad as this is a 5star hotel with one star service,2,January 2020,
What you would expect from Shangri-La,Melinda G,"There is nothing I could really fault, beautiful lobby, great bars, great service and lovely rooms. My only issue with hotels like the Shangri-La is the size, hard to get space at the pool for example, everything always felt a tad crowded. For the price, I would have preferred to stay at a boutique hotel where you would be in a more intimate scene.  Other than the size and traffic, there was nothing I would fault.",4,January 2020,

A Beautiful Hotel!,CCMcM2013,"I love this hotel so much! I used to visit for both business and family holiday breaks, but I hadn't returned for some years when I decided to take a week's vacation there over New Year. Apart from a few minor changes, it's remained the same. It is still as impressive as my first visit. The staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and come equipped with everything you could possibly need. Great products in the bathroom too. I went to two of the restaurants this time and they were both excellent. The grounds/pool are gorgeous. My only pet peeve is that guests go to the pool very early in the morning and put something on several chairs to claim them for later and then disappear for hours, leaving other guests without a place to sit. There is a sign saying…",5,January 2020,
Home away from Home,Ketul Agrawal,"We were on family vacation to Singapore. It was first trip with the young brigade. Since we were 3 couples with 3 kids we were under doubt regarding the experience as it was our first trip abroad with them. The check In process was smooth and friendly. The biggest hurdle was food. Being pure vegetarian it was difficult to find many options for breakfast. Luckily Chef Dilip Nayak and his team made their best efforts to assist us. He particularly requested for our Indian food demands and made delicious Indian Masala Tea, Uttapam, Chole and all for all of us. The dinner preparation was very opt for us with delicious Dal Tadka, Panner and Bhindi Fry.   Over all this trip to Shangri La would not have been this great without Chef Dilip and his team. Thank you for this overwhelming…",5,January 2020,
the importance of staff continuity,Brigitte V,"As a visitor to Shangri la Singapore for nearly one decade, I would like to say what difference it makes to be greeted year after year by the same members of staff. They make us feel more valued as loyal friends of the city and of the hotel and less as just a room number. For this reason, my husband and I would like to thank specifically: Bernard who every morning at the swimming pool takes the time to greet us and a lot of other people while checking everything is alright at the same time. With his long experience, he  is able to quickly notice and calm most disruptions around the pool. Raymond who is always working hard around the pool but still wave to the guests.  The older masseur who always welcomes back returning guests. in the valley wing, Dominique who is always…",4,January 2020,
Feels like a second home,jfzmwz80,"Our 5yo has declared that Shangri-La is “her” hotel- no wonder, as the staff really do make it a point to make her feel at home. This goes beyond the childrens’ amenities - such as a dedicated check in area and the fabulous play and Swimming areas. We, as parents, really appreciate that they take the time to talk to and engage with her.   So, all stars as a family friendly hotel. And for travellers without children, don’t worry- the layout and space ensures that the hotel remains tranquil and there is more than enough space for everyone. The rooms are also most definitely clean and spacious, and for families, do request for s room with a sofa bed made up for the children.   Although the hotel is not within walking distance to Orchard road, it does provide a complimentary…",5,July 2019,
4th birthday staycation with family,QL Lim,"We had a wonderful stay at the family room (our 3rd stay in the last 12 month), celebrating our little one 4th birthday. The room reservation team did a fabulous job decorating the room with balloons, a birthday banner together with a delightful birthday cake. The little one was thrilled to see the decoration. Had a separate lunch celebration with the extended families at The Lobby and the F&B team did a great job pulling it together despite having 2 birthday celebration parties on the same day.",4,January 2020,
Fabulous service at The Line,Jenny L,"Thank you to Stacey from The Line restaurant for her fabulous and attentive service and making us feel at home.

Wonderful Horizon Club staff!,missjay10,"This is a long overdue review but better late than never. I had very relaxing stay at Shangril- La Hotel and it is mostly due to the wonderful service of the Horizon Club . Since we were there for rest, we enjoyed the amenities of the Horizon Club and was there for high tea and cocktails most of the time. I personally liked the concept of having a separate Family Corner for families that bring their children to the lounge.  I would like to thank Viola, Gian and Ella for taking care of us during our stay. No request was too complicated for them and they always served us with a smile. Viola especially took note of the cheese I took a liking to and asked the kitchen if they had more in stock for me. These are little things that make a difference in making a stay memorable for a…",5,August 2019,
Excellent Hotel with good location,maghh05,"We loved our stay, we recognize the Shangri-La brand as excellent and this stay lived up to that. The location towards Orchard road is very convenient and makes easy to get around Singapore. Our room was very nice and overlooked the amazing gardens and pool. The Housekeeping was excellent.  The Hotel has several restaurant options. We ate breakfast most days at the Line, which had everything you could wish for breakfast, and most importantly great coffee. We also took breakfast in the Italian restaurant by the pool one day and we were not disappointed, very good and more quite.   As we were at the Hotel for Christmas we booked in advance the Christmas dinner at the Line, second seating and it was just great. We did dine once in the lobby bar and is was quite good and we bought…",5,December 2019,
Great Hotel,Meander800093,Lovely hotel and in a quiet area and close to orchard road and easy to get around singapore.  The room was lovely and overlooked the amazing gardens and pool.  Used the gym which was good and well equipped and lovely changing rooms.  This is a hotel of quality.  Room was lovely and had everything we needed.  Housekeeping was excellent.  Had drinks in the lobby and bought some food from the  bakery and pizza from the restaurant downstairs.It is a great hotel  if you just want to relax.  Staff were all so lovely could not fault this hotel at all. Will definitely return,5,September 2019,
Lovely and tranquil space in the hustle and bustle of Singapore,Gillian L,"Slightly out of the way lies this well appointed hotel with numerous bars and restaurants. We booked an Horizon Club room which gives the benefits of complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks & canapes every day.  The choice is excellent and service attentive.  The rooms might be ready for upgrading but spacious and comfortable.  Would definitely stay again.",5,January 2020,
Luxurious,sayedz2017,Stayed dec’19 with wife and 2 kids. Booked connecting rooms which was spacious and luxurious as expected from the brand. Hotel offers shuttle to orchard rd on the hr every hr up until 7pm. Best to be 15mins early in the queue. Prefer the tower block rather that garden wing. Location abit quiet as hotel is in residential area with not much to do around. Andreas at check is brilliant and an absolute assist to the company as is Syra from the Restuarant. What a pleasure meeting these 2 people. Taxi or shuttle required for any trips from hotel. Price can range from SGD 7 - 20 to furthest destination.,5,December 2019,
Fabulous Stay,paul826nas,"Visited the Shangri La Hotel, Singapore for two nights at the end of a weeks stay in the city. Acc  We have stayed here a couple of times before, although the last was in 2012, so we were looking forward to seeing how things had changed and I must say what a transformation in the reception, it now looks nothing like we knew.  LWe had originally booked a room in the Tower Wing with Club access, but after being told the rooms there had been refitted a few earlier, I changed our reservation to a larger room in the Valley Wing, and boy was I impressed.  The room was very large and sumptuous with a great view over pool and gardens as well as the city. We had all day access to the valley lounge where there was a full complimentary bar all day, high tea in the afternoon and guest…",5,November 2019,
Improvement Needed,Anon F,"We’re currently staying at the hotel A couple of things have disappointed us: 1. We paid for access to the horizon club..certain parts of the horizon club have very noticeable sewage smell every day we have visited so far...it’s terrible. 2. Disappointing that multiple items on the pool menu aren’t available: today for example, both Rose wine options weren’t available and none of the four smoothies on menu were available. Service around pool is often slow: drinks arrive warm and food sometimes cold.  I’m happy to pay for a top hotel, but I expect good services and facilities in return.  I will raise these concerns with the manager ",3,January 2020,
over the last 10 days,Willem Nieuwhof,"I visited the hotel with a good friend who frequently eats at this hotel, I like the hotel very much and the waterfall restaurant is my favourite. I drink Decaf coffee but it was impossible to get a hot cup of decaf coffee, we gave it a last shot last night at the lobby lunch but where unsuccessful in receiving a hot cup of decaf coffee, when you charge $ 16.50 for a dubble Expresso, you should be able to be served a hot coffee at a place that is otherwise almost perfect, Iwill be back March 14th and have an other go at it!!

Perfect for children,Anonymous,"Stayed here for 5 nights over Xmas with a toddler and lots of family. Overall we had a great stay. Wonderful service from all the staff. Room requests were promptly attended to and the life guards at the pool do an amazing job watching over all the kids! Rooms are decently sized, clean and comfortable. No bidet in the toilet though. Shuttle service to orchard road was very punctual. Would’ve appreciated more frequent and later shuttle services though we still managed with taxis etc. The hotel did a great job decorating the hotel for Xmas and we (especially the toddler) loved all the Xmas ‘extras’ like Santa, the train ride in the garden and the chocolate snowman left in our room. Buds, the in house indoor playground is truly amazing. My toddler went almost everyday and is still…",5,December 2019,
Best hotel so far,Christine M,"Staff are always accommodating especially siri in reception. Food are good too and the ambiance! We had afternoon tea at the lobby and it was great. They have shuttle bus going to orchard better check that one! All was great, cant wait to go back!!!",5,December 2019,
Good for families. great location,EEjBEE,"Family of four - 2 adults and 2 kids. The service from check in to check out was flawless. The team was kind enough to give us early check in at 10am.   Ms Ketki at the front desk was extremely helpful by arranging food / special requests for my kids who were unwell.  Their kids club is amazing! although it comes at an additional cost, its worth it.  The in room dining service and restaurants offer a great vareity and quality.   Location wise, its centrally placed and allows easy access to most tourist spots.  Highliy recommended for families.",4,December 2019,
An Initial Disappointment Turned Around by Good Service Staff,AvideSg,"I booked a one-night stay on the 27th December, given room 1810 and then 0628. My initial check-in experience was quite a let down. Firstly, I had requested during my reservations for an early check-in as we had booked the place for a birthday celebration.   However, on the day itself at 1pm, I was told that there wasn’t any ready room. Worse, I had explained about my tight schedule that afternoon and asked for a rough estimation so that I could have a headway but only to be told they do not know in return. Without an estimation of how long the wait would be, I was left helpless as to know what to do next and could not go about the rest of the day’s program. The whole process at the reception took me about half an hour, still without any room keys issued for me to put my luggage…",4,December 2019,
Really good Valley Wing stay,hardpack,"We booked the Valley Wing for this stay; it is the more ""exclusive"" shall we say part of the hotel. It has its own entrance and reception and make sure you ask your taxi driver to drop you there and not the main entrance as it is not easy to drive round to the Valley WIng from the main entrance. President Trump stayed here when he met Kim Jong-Il. I believe that this was the original Shangri-La hotel. You check in at the Valley Wing entrance. Your room key will only allow you access to your own floor in the lifts.   I had a suite with an enormous living room and bedroom and gigantic bathroom. Comfortable luxurious furniture and fittings. Definitely a feel of that 1980s plush fabrics decoration rather than the steel and glass more modern places, but I preferred this. Having said…",5,November 2019,

Super Experience,11117777,First trip to Singapore and the hotel was excellent. Very family friendly. Rooms were immaculate. The pool area was a little crowded but lots of families with kids were having a great time. The staff was professional and very polite. It’s located just off the main road but it’s an easy walk to everything. We were here briefly on the way to Phuket. I wish we had reversed the itinerary and spent more time in Singapore.,5,December 2019,
Swimming Pool Chaos,elainer,"Hopefully this isn’t normal for the hotel as it is a holiday period, but I am one of the lucky guests that has a sun lounger. There simply aren’t enough to go around. The pool staff are inundated & just simply say ‘we are full’. Tempers are fraying.  I think the manager should be made aware & buy more!! It’s chaos here!!  On a positive, room lovely & staff pleasant",4,December 2019,
Terrific concierge desk,Travels with Charlie,The concierge and front desk staff made the difference for us on this stay they were excellent. Johnny in particular was a true professional. We asked about last minute tickets the morning of Christmas Day to the Gardens by the Bay winter wonderland and other events. Johnny would not rest until he found us tickets for everything and even found discounted prices.  He did so with a genuine cheerfulness and a high degree of skill.  He really made a favorable impression.   We stayed as a family of five in two Garden Wing Deluxe rooms. One room had a king and the other had two queen beds. We added a rollaway bed as well which we found to be quite comfortable.    Here are some of the pros and cons. First the pros:  - The rooms in the Garden wing feel modern and clean.   - The bathroom…,4,December 2019,

Wonderful stay!,StaceyChan,"Check-in was fast and smooth. The hotel surrounding is beautiful. We stayed in tower room, the room is in a good shaped and well clean. The location is not near to Orchard, but they do provide shuttle, the mini bus was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent, has varieties and plenty of healthy food, gluten free etc. BUDS was fun and staff was attentive. Kids love it. ",4,December 2019,
One of the best Shangrila,Antonio Kris,"Stayed this hotel several times, from doorman to check in all staf is very attentive. Location even not at orchard but in a very good area.

Not easy to find the hotel with garden in singapore.",5,December 2019,
Elevation,KWSKAN,"What began as confirming Tickets to the World’s Biggest Band.  To the Biggest Birthday Surprise till date  We Opted for Shangri-la Singapore for its location which was just a Hop, Skip & Jump from Orchid Road  The Hotel was Expansive with many Oasis areas dotted around.  Check-in was seamless and was pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to The Valley Wing.  This maybe the old part of the hotel but what it lacked in décor made up with sheer service & opulence.   The Upgrade came with the use of the Club Lounge and Summit Room Champagne Breakfast. Not to be missed,  the service was warm and genuine. Nothing was too much trouble. They catered to our every whim.  We only wished we could have stayed a little longer to enjoy the other facilities that this Hotel offered.",4,December 2019,
Not just for the rich and famous,Naresh M,"An absolute gem of a location with plenty of history. The only place to stay if you are in Singapore. Walking distance to shops and restaurants, our stay was too short and missed out on the pool, oh well - one for next time.",5,November 2019,
Great place in SG,Rick Davis,Beautiful hotel. Wonderful experience. The breakfast is awesome and the egg bar is a great time. The views are very good and the staff is top notch! I would highly recommend. The lobby is decorated beautifully for Christmas,5,December 2019,
"Great, but not outstanding",CB96,"Stayed for two nights in November. The Shangri La is attractive, comfortable and does feel like an oasis of calm in the bust city centre.   If you want to be on Orchard Road, it’s close, but not quite on it. So you may wish to factor that in.   The lobby and pool were excellent. Room was comfortable, with a large bathroom. We stayed in the tower on the 12th floor and had good city views.   Breakfast was pretty chaotic. It was okay but I expected a nicer feel to a restaurant in the Shangrii La. It was a bit like a noisy canteen.   So, it was very nice, but for those reasons I’ll probably stay somewhere else when I go back to Singapore in the summer.",4,November 2019,

Beyond all expectations...,John M,"I was slightly disappointed on arrival to be informed that the room with balcony I had booked was unavailable due to maintenance. However, the reception manager offered my wife and I a free upgrade to 'a much quieter' wing of the hotel. We were so glad that she did!

Beautiful stay. Lovely hotel,amandajolly,I absolutely loved my stay here and the hotel has a good location right by Orchard Road for the shops.  A very nice welcome when we arrived and then taken to our rooms which were a wow  lovely view out to the pool and the most gorgeous bathroom lovely bath with a separate shower.  We stayed in the horizon wing which offered champagne and drinks and a private breakfast area.

As great as ever,PoolBarPlease,"We chose to return to Shangri-La to celebrate my wife’s birthday with a two night staycation and, again, it did not disappoint.  We stayed in a Tower Wing 1BR for two nights which is spacious and comfortable, not to mention quiet. It comfortably slept the two of us with our 4 y/o on a foldout. An excellent option for a small family. The facilities at the hotel are second to none, particularly the kids club which has seemingly endless options for play with interactive, fun staff keen to ensure the kids are having a blast.  A big thanks to staff and management for making the birthday one for the books and a special mention to Nesh at the pool who was extremely friendly and attentive; it made our time at Shangri-La just that little bit more special. We’ll be back soon!",5,December 2019,

Good TV channel selection and strong wifi , no need to mess around with access codes . A number of restaurants although i only used the same one for lunch and dinner on a few occasions called The Line on first floor.

This looks like a nice property but the staff is clearly trained and taught to openly RACIALLY DISCRIMINATE and then not own up to it but argue with their customers. I was booked for 4 nights but had an INSULTING incident the first night at the poolside, where their pool staff, this guy called NESH openly discriminated and when the incident was narrated to the hotel , they made another story saying the routine procedure was being followed.

Lunch Wedding Banquet,geraldchan,"Attended a lunch wedding banquet here yesterday, ballroom was decently large that afforded the couple space for a dance floor as well. All is great, except some feedback on the food and drinks service: - after polishing off my wine after the first course, my wine glass was left empty for most of the 6 course meal and only refilled nearing the dessert; - all dishes were individually plated - for a certain prawn dish it appeared that everyone had 2 prawns while I had one, which was rather amusing to me.

So i waited in the lobby for them to call me, after an hour i queued again as they had forgotten to call me, finally i got into my room, it seemed small and standard, and when i queried as i left it tirns out they had not given me the upgrade or bothered to inform me of that.

Third visit - minor unnecessary inconveniences,Luxhol12,"This is our third visit to the Shangri-La Singapore. We have stayed in both the Tower Wings (twice) and the Valley Wing. On this occasion, we stayed for 7 nights in a Junior Suite in the Tower Wing. This room is exceptional. It met all our needs (couple + 5 year old child). The sofa bed that comes in the room is extremely handy, it folds out to a very comfortable and low lying bed for the 5 year old, we didn't have to worry about her rolling off. I always have to build some sort of fort on the side of any rollaway beds to create a barrier for the 5 year old so that she wouldn't roll off, but this sofa bed did not require it. The kitchenette in the Junior Suite was excellent. The king size bed was very comfortable. It was like having our own little apartment in a hotel.…",4,November 2019,
5 star service,ashwingo,I stayed here for 4 nights on a business conference taking place at the hotel. I arrived very early in the morning and as expected the room was not available. They promised to email me as soon as the room was ready. This never happened. I was allowed to shower and refresh at the gym and spa facilities which is well equipped with amenities. After spending time in the town I headed back after 3pm for my room. I was given my room key and my luggage was already in my room. An earlier check in time without extra charges could be an improvement. As usual the dreaded charge on the credit card in case you use the hotel services.

The staff are exceptionally attentive and the food in the varying restaurants is excellent. The location is quiet and the rooms are equipped  to a very high standard. The Shangri-La is very large hotel with a full range of facilities. We stayed here for two nights, while en route to Java  for our honeymoon.

Superb,pboptom,"We flew from Heathrow for a 3 night stay to start our 2 week holiday around Singapore and Thailand. This was our 2nd visit to the Shangri-La. When we arrived there was a potentially visit spoiling mix up over the booking (not the hotel's fault). Janice Ang went above and beyond the call of duty on behalf of the hotel to sort it out for us. Our suite was amazing, similar to the one we stayed in on our last visit. Sizeable rooms with the bathroom was one of my favourites, being big and shiny. The hotel is just off one end of Orchard Road so well placed to explore the centre of Singapore. Breakfast was excellent, not so much for variety, which was average, but for quality,  of service, food and surroundings. Afternoon tea as well as evening canapes are a lovely touch. It is…",5,November 2019,
Restaurant Waterfall - One of the best Italian,LuxJw,"When it comes to Italian restaurants, there are way too many options in Singapore. Apart from quality, one major concern is always consistency.   Without any prejudice, this is something Waterfall excels in. Don’t get me wrong, the food is amazing. Nothing too innovative, just ‘eccellente italiano’.   The service here is always either fabulous or beyond. People remembers you and your preferences. Roy and Dinesh were always very kind to us. Apart from the attentiveness and thoughtful recommendations, they were also managing the team and restaurant through their peripheral vision.   Now that’s management! ",5,November 2019,
Mrs Craven,Pamela C,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous in every way! We had a room in the garden wing overlooking the pool. It was quiet, clean, modern with a touch of comfort, providing sofas, rugs, little tables etc. One luxury was the automated closing of the curtains, pure delight! We had a lovely meal in the Shang Palace restaurant which was very authentic. Just a cup of tea was a luxury event, served in beautiful teapots and cups and saucers.  There was a variety of choice of menus for breakfast  to suit different nationalities in a restaurant  overlooking the pool. The pool staff were attentive, laying out a towel on the sun beds and provided a second towel for use. The reception staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times especially Seri and Elvis  What made this hotel exceptional…",5,November 2019,
Very nice hotel.,m h,The staff was very helpful and friendly.   The breakfast buffet was excellent with many fresh options.   The property is within walking distance to the nicest shopping area in Singapore.   Well worth the money.,5,November 2019,
Outstanding Service From The Team!,Veronica P,"My parents chose to celebrate their 50th Wedding Anniversary on 16th November with a lunch gathering of relatives and old friends at “The Line Buffet Restaurant” in the Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore. There were over 60 guests and we were given an entire section in the corner to ourselves which was perfect as it gave us some privacy. The service staff were attentive, making sure to attend to everyone’s needs promptly. My parents and I are very grateful to the Shangri La team for taking such good care of us and all our guests during the event.  I need to especially thank the warm and caring Operations Manager Zubidah, and the ever efficient managerial team of Crystal and Syra at The Line who were really on the ball every step of the way as we planned and prepared for this event…",5,November 2019,
Great 2-day stay with my family!,ppfera,"We stayed at a themed family room/suite... our kids loved it!!

Shangri-La was amazing!,Mike L,"Had the most amazing stay here! Received the best service from Alex Lee.

Oasis amoung the buildings,Matthew S,"A superb hotel that's more like an inner city oasis. Check in was delightful, Jeb was warm, friendly and engaging. The lobby is impressive and grand. Our room with city views was in excellent condition and had lovely decor and facilities. The pool area is more resort chic than inner city business as it's surrounded by lush tropical gardens. Breakfast quality was very good and the resident cat really made me feel happy and like I was at home.   I decided to review as very good rather than excellent fit the following reasons.  1. The bedding in the room is hard and unforgiving, especially for a heavier person, why is so hard to get a plush bed in Asia?   2. I saw no commitment from the hotel to reduce plastic waste. This was seriously very disappointing for me given the huge…",4,November 2019,
Truly A Paradise in Singapore,Gary,"We stayed three days in the Shangri-La Hotel during our vacation in Singapore. The first day was in the Garden Wing, which is a very nice area within the hotel. The room was excellent with views of the city. The Horizon Club Lounge offers even better views of the city.  The two days that we were in the Valley Wing of Shangri-La were simple elegant and refined! From the hospitality to the attention to detail, everything was wonderful. Each staff member we interacted with not only were professional, they truly made us feel welcome, as though we were family.   Breakfast in the Summit room was simply grand, and both my wife and I felt like royalty. The food is five stars all around, and service is exceptional ( even for a five star rating).  Strolling through the grounds was so…",5,November 2019,

So wonderful afternoon tea at Lobby lounge,Nicole yun,"2 days ago i went to Shangri-la LOBBY LOUNGE to enjoy my afternoon tea with my old friends.  The lobby lounge atmophere was gorgeous and like the singer there. the song was my favorite.  it was not noisy so very good choice to choose here to have a chat with. We wanted to sit near a nice view so asked staff Wendy about it. She was so polite and guide friendly to the table. and she gave us a big and comfortable table. We could see the whole pool view.  And she also took a nice photo of us. had a lot of fun. Belinda explained us about the afternoon tea component.  There was an Durian dessert, some rollcakes, tart,dumplings,and some local desserts.

Started Badly ending great,CLKPerth,"On our trip to Europe we stayed at Shangri La Singapore on the way over for 2 nights and on the way back also 2 nights.  Before leaving Perth I had emailed Shangri-La (and many other hotels) about whether or not they took credit card pre authorisations upon arrival. I was answered back in writing  no they do not. I had pre paid my accommodation.   So we arrived, were greeted beautifully, upgraded to a suite which was fantastic. After being shown to suite i was asked for credit card for pre authorisation. I explained i had asked this and was told no in writing this doesn't happen. Greeter said ok no problems and off she went.   So we go down to pool, have a swim then order a drink.

Loved this Hotel,N P,"My wife and I stayed here for a 30th anniversary trip and it turned out to be a perfect choice.To us this is the best hotel in Singapore the location being just that little bit out of the hustle and bustle but at the same time with the complimentary shuttle bus to the MRT  everything is very quick to access.There is nothing I can criticise about this place, however the next time we stay which we will definitely endeavour to do we will pay the little bit extra to have a room in the Garden Wing.Top marks to all the staff and management who run this SUPERB hotel",5,April 2019,

They were patient and understanding which made us feel welcome even before we even arrived.  We booked airport transfer for 150 Singapore dollars and we think it was worth it. The staff met us at our gate, walked us through customs and the airport. The driver took us straight to the hotel. We were so excited because I had a special surprise for my girls and felt this was the perfect place to do it.  When we arrived, there was a gentleman already waiting for us.

Great stay but horrid Pre-stay experience,Benjamin G,"We had another great stay at the Shangri-la hotel over the long weekend and this time round, we booked the Premier Balcony Suite at the Garden Wing, which had a lovely balcony with a Jacuzzi, ample seating area and a BBQ grill that served as a perfect space for our intimate gathering. We had a small celebration for my son’s one year old birthday and the guests whom I’ve invited were very impressed by the room and the hotel. Having stayed at all the 3 different wings at Shangri-la, we always prefer the Garden Wing for its lush greenery, which gives a very relaxing and welcoming vibe of being in an urban oasis. For this stay, we stayed at the crown of the Garden Wing and soaking in the comforts of a private heated Jacuzzi (especially at night) was an unparalleled experience that…",4,October 2019,

I’ve been staying here at the Valley Wing for many years. It has always been wonderful. I’ve practically lived in  upmarket hotels around the world for the last 30+ years. No where beats the Shangri-La Valley Wing. But when you return anywhere the worry is that standards might have slipped.

Disappointed,39er,Have stayed at the Shangri La on a number of times and rated it 5 stars and our special place in Singapore. But that was then this is now. The Hotel Foyer has been revamped and as a consequence the hotel has lost its allure. It has a cold impersonal air about it. The staff that were once friendly now seem distant. The Italian Restaurant which we looked forwarded to so much was a flop. Sea Food Marinara was luke warm and noticeable for its lack of sea food. The pasta was undercooked as well which made it difficult to chew. Breakfast was served in the Line and that's what it was. We formed a line and when a table became vacant the race was on to get it. We took turns in guarding our possession and getting our food in competition with quite a large number of fellow guests.…,3,August 2019,

We received very fast responses and staff was also accommodating to our request for the suite at the highest level. Right till the end, the staff offered to help us with our baggage to the car which was quite some distance away.

"Pleasant stay, with caveats",313robins,"Overall a pleasant stay, but with so many other luxury options to choose from in Singapore, not my favorite. The nits: I do not expect housekeeping to be superhuman, but the sheer number of stray hairs in the bathroom was off-putting. Children's amenities had to be requested separately despite our informing we were staying with a child. Buds outdoor play/splash area was closed for renovation. This was either not disclosed on the website or we somehow missed it, which is a shame because the kids' area was a major draw for us.

Lovely hotel but just not quite as good as it used to be,Adelaide5000,"First up:  this has to be the loveliest smelling hotel lobby. I want my house to smell this beautiful.

The Garden Wing is lovely as you have outside walkways around a garden area leading to the rooms. The rooms are well equipped. One day we can hope that the televisions in hotel rooms allow for streaming services, but the big hotels aren’t there yet. Some smaller ones are doing this and it is a great move.

An Uber classy 5star hotel just outside the city center so it’s feels very green rather than urban. Yet still everything from Raffels to markets to the gardens is only a $6 cab ride away.  Our family of 5, teenagers mum dad and mother-in-law, all loved this place.  I think the accommodation itself was outstanding and very good value but as is the case with all 5star hotels (particularly in Singapore), the restaurants and drinks poolside etc are very expensive.

The 24th floor is the Horizon club whereby you can enjoy your breakfast in piece and quiet in the morning as well as have afternoon tea between 2pm and 4pm and the all your alcohol included between 5pm and 8pm.

Fantastic Singapore hotel,SydneyAussieboy,"We have just completed another 4 day stay in the Valley Wing of the Shangri la hotel.  You are made to feel special from the moment you arrive, with reception staff and porters coming outside to greet you at your car and welcome you to the hotel.  In our case, after a 6:30 am arrival from Europe, the welcome was even more special when we learned our room was already available!  Even the ""standard"" suites are large and luxuriously appointed and the Valley Wing benefits  - breakfast, high tea, evening canapés and all day bar service - are all first class.

Great Stay,STC256,"We stayed there overnight in the Garden Wing rooms on two occasions in September. The rooms were large and very nice, if a little dated, but very comfortable and well appointed nonetheless. They have usable balconies overlooking the pool and gardens. The pool area is very nice.

Service at check in / out and poolside was friendly and very helpful - special thanks to Itz.",5,September 2019,
A romantic and pleasant experience,Joyce03,"Checking in was smooth with welcome drink served. Upon check in, the front desk officer sent me to the lift lobby, presented me with a stalk of orchid flower. It was indeed a pleasant experience. I have booked the Garden wing - Deluxe room for celebration of my wedding anniversary. The room is spacious with the view of the swimming pool and garden. We had a wonderful time enjoying the peace and comfort of nature and yet so near to the city. However, there was a glass dining table with 2 chairs that was in the middle of our room which seems a bit out of place.  We had a good stroll in the morning at the garden and enjoyed the nice orchid shelter at the back of the garden. It was a good and wonderful stay-cation experience.",4,October 2019,
Is the Valley Wing worth the extra expense?,auzzieVic,"This is the question I now ask myself.    I start by saying my stay in The Valley Wing was an upgrade as I had planned to book a Garden Wing Suite but they didn’t have availability and upgraded me.  So to be fair I got the room at a discount and thank you Shangri La.  The Valley Wing is beautifully presented with extremely friendly staff.  It offers an open bar from 11am till 10:30 and regular snacks.  The area is peaceful and smart, and if that is what you want then the Shangri La is a superb hotel.  But i would have prefered my Garden Wing Balcony Suite with a pool view.  The Valley Wing offers you your own private dinning room for breakfast.  However, you have to dress and its so quiet you can hear a pin drop.  The menu is freshly made but this means you have to know…",3,October 2019,

The ultimate remarkable family holiday,Issic,"We stayed in the Horizon club junior suite. It exceeded all of our expectations, and we had very high expectations after staying in very good hotels in the past. No one as good as this one. The room was absolutely amazing and comfortable, always clean and someone came to check if we need anything every day, the buds for kids was very helpful for us as family with children. The fact that this is also very family oriented was major consideration for us. The friendly staff and the check in process. Even though we arrived early, we were taken immediately to the lounge and were allowed to use all facilities. Didn’t happen to me in any hotel so far where nothing was allowed before room was ready and official check in time. Thank you very much and I am sure we will be back again.",5,September 2019,
Sure thing !,GGDD,"You can't get it wrong booking the Shangri-La in Singapore, be it for a business trip (short or extended) or a family vacation, you will find superior hospitality and service, a business and a vacation atmosphere in the middle of lush greenery and all a stone throw away from the busy center.",5,October 2019,
Great birthday treat,NHShanghai,"We spent some days at the Singapore Shangri-La Hotel early October. The property seemed to be upgraded recently, for it to be the first ever Hotel of the Shangri-La Group it looked very nice and warm. The room was perfect, we had a junior suite and got a great welcome. The check-in already was great, then we frequently used the Horizon Lounge and up there the staff was so friendly and anticipated our needs. Looking forward to the next visit when in Singapore.",5,October 2019,
Great Place to Stay,15J0_,"After several years of not having stayed in Shangri-la Singapore, it is nice to be back in that hotel thanks to the organizers of the event I participated.  I used to stay in the hotel almost every year some years back. And it is delightful to see that the services have remained as friendly and efficient as ever. I noticed though that the food selection during breakfast has decreased. The airconditioning throughout the hotel, whether in the Valley Wing or main tower is also just too cold for comfort. Perhaps, they should consider putting the thermostat a bit. Not only will that save on energy, it will also make guests more confortable. Likewise, it would be helpful if they make the food bar at the Horizon Club Lounge close a little bit later, say 9 or even 10PM. This would allow…",5,October 2019,
I need Green which is why I alwasy stay at the Singapore Shangri-La,Mieke&Vic,"A spacious room with a very comfy bed! I stayed at other hotels in Singapore, but this property remains my favorite by far! Staff is so discrete and friendly. The breakfast offers so many options. The pool is great with very attentive staff (including pool guards should you bring your little one's). Orchard Road is walking distance.   I will be back!",5,September 2019,
Wonderful stay,Jacqueline P,"Once again the Shangri La lived up to and beyond expectations for service, friendliness, efficiency and amenities.  The only slight disappointment was to find that the Water Grill no longer served breakfast or coffee in the mornings for those of us in the garden wing or at all. However the hotel generally continues to delight and I hope to return another day.",5,October 2019,
Nice hotel with all amenities and courteous staff,chetan g,I stayed for 9 days on a business trip. Conveniently located on orchard road (just 0.4 miles) to the shopping area. Staff is very courteous and they take care of special requests for you. Hotel has all amenities in room except microwave. Restaurants are quite good too.,5,September 2019,
Fantastic buffet,Markus K,One of the finest and best buffets in Singapore for sure. Located near Orchard Road and nestled in a beautiful rain forest it serves a great variety of foods from Asian to Western to Middle Eastern. Go!,4,September 2019,
Resort Style Hotel With a Factory Feel,chrismcl,"I was attracted by the thought of a green hotel in a garden city. Realistically, bubbling waterfalls, big swimming pools, well kept lawns and a few tennis courts did seem to offer some respite from the hot sticky and busy world outside the hotel gates. We stayed in the Garden wing. We had a beautifully clean room with hardwood floors, opening onto a balcony edged with a sea of bright red flowers. The beds were firm and comfortable. The pillows (so often a weak spot in luxury hotels) were just right.  I can recommend the spa. I had a Thai massage and my daughter had a facial. Ultra relaxing and the spa had a serene and calming atmosphere with very skilled staff.  Breakfast was included and was awesome in it's variety, quality and quantity. I lost count with over eighteen…",4,August 2019,
Consistently excellent for so many years..,EddieC566,"I have been staying at the Shangri La Singapore since 1994....I was a regular there several times a year for business purposes as Singapore was our newly established hub. Now I have retired to NZ and don’t travel for business anymore....I decided that en route to the UK to visit family I would stay at the Shangri La for 3 nights to break up the journey. The incredible high standard of customer service has not changed one bit...The Hotel is impeccable in its manner warmly welcoming you at the door and it is same at reception.Staying in the Tower Wing, The rooms are generously luxurious and will make any long trip less stressful. Superb large pool - really loved being back here and will be again on my return journey in October - Highly recommended. ",4,September 2019,
"Amazing stay !,,",Mikefareham56,"Just had 2 nights here on route home and wow!! Stayed in a valley suite 660,it was truly stunning!!! lounge,bedroom,and bathroom were just beautiful, the staff were incredible and made our wedding anniversary so memorable , we cannot thank you enough 🙏🏻 and will most definitely return in the not too distant future 🤞🤞🌞",5,September 2019,
Vegaterian/Vegan/Gym,Parm,"We have tried all the luxury hotels in Singapore. We have found Shangri-La to be the most helpful, most selection and clearly signed for vegan/vegetarian/lacto- vegetarian diets. Indran at the Gym was very helpful by clearly showing where the facilities are. This made  the experience non-threatening as it can be at some gyms.",5,September 2019,
Perfect place to stay,Douglas,"As the flagship Shangri-La hotel worldwide, SL SG truly delivers the highest SL standard.  Check-in process was smooth and every of my needs from the hotel was taken care of promptly.  Will definately consider staying here in my future trips.",5,September 2019,
Stayed and conducted company meeting,Emad B,Our stay with Shangri-La was excellent. The staff were helpful and excited to support.  The rooms were great and conference room was well prepared.  Our stay was for four nights and conducted two meetings in the hotel,5,September 2019,

Best MICE Hotel In Singapore,B Lee,I worked with Sales and Events Manager all over Asia for Meeting & Incentive Groups.  Mercadia Wong and Aisyah Ahmad are amongst the best hotelier you can work with.  Their attention to details and swift response are rarely found in modern world.,5,September 2019,
Luxury for the entire family,aisadia,"We had an amazing time at a staycation for our little family. Asian hospitality is unparalleled but Singapore often lags behind in this area - Shangri-La proved it otherwise. It is one of the most child friendly hotels I've ever stayed at, without compromising on luxury. The hotel staff were extremely accommodating (I was a strict detox and they went out of their way to cater to my idiosyncrasies).  Excellent food options (without breaking the bank), leafy but central neighbourhood, a ton of activities for children and beautiful newly renovated rooms - we will definitely go back!",5,September 2019,
An absolutely lovely hotel,hejo,"everything is excellent here. Service, rooms, food, breakfast, kids breakfast, family oriented, orchid garden, lush environment...the list goes on, and on. the only thing irritating is people who run out at 6 am to grab the best seats around the pool...then they go eat breakfast....if you come down to the pool at 9 am all chairs are taken, but few sit there....(around school holidays, this is...)",5,January 2019,
Amazing hotel...1st class in everything,LM..1930,"Stayed here for 4 nights but wish it was 2 weeks...beautiful hotel, amazing restaurants, bars,sitting areas & the best staff ever!! Our room was beautiful and spacious. The Horizon club was superb and my partners birthday was acknowledged with a lovely cake. Nothing was too much for any staff. This hotel is fab for families but still felt relaxing as a couple. Can't wait to go back..🤗",5,September 2019,
Super,Big M,After the hustle and bustle of the F1 GP it was an absolute pleasure to spend 4 days on some serious R and R. I cannot think of a better place too stay. Everything is done so well that I never have reason to make extra requests. I fact there is no reason to leave the sanctuary of the hotel. I do however like the Penang Shangri-La because they have an Adults only area pool for one wing of the hotel. Perhaps club rooms and suites should have inclusive soft drinks at the pool. Negating the need to go to the club lounge. Would be a great addition to the club room.,5,September 2019,
Staycation 2019,jojo v,It was a very nice stay in this lovely and family-friendly hotel. The staff are very polite.  Our daughter really enjoyed playing at The Buds which is quite a huge playground.  We also have a great buffet experience at The Line restaurant.  Highly recommended.,5,September 2019,
Afternoon tea @ lobby is fantastic,Fanny L,"Two of us having the local kueh (small cakes & snack) for less than S$30 per head. Service is attentive and polite, food are well prepared & presented. Ambience is relax, clam & elegant. The only the local tea is way too sweet. Even after adding water, it is hardly drinkable. ",5,September 2019,
Wonderful luxe hotel,IG Melbourne,"While on recent stop over stays in Singapore to and from Europe I had the pleasure to stay at the Singapore Shangri-La. Love this luxe hotel!  The rooms were spacious, comfortable and clean, and the hotel had such a wonderful atmosphere.  On the first stay I very much enjoyed wonderful Chinese cuisine at The Shang Palace.  Also spent much relaxing time in their glorious Chi Spa.  I had a trip of forgetting things and when I left my daughter’s framed photo in my room they organised to have it couriered back to me in Australia. Wonderful people, they made the stay such a pleasure and made sure I had an extra special room on my last night. Definitely will be visiting again.",5,September 2019,
Superb Experience!!,wanderLAST62,"I stayed for a night in garden wing with my friends and I was really impressed. We used to stay in Tower Wing but we found Garden Wing is much better as rooms have balcony and is more of resort style.  The staff were all friendly and accommodating starting from the lobby especially Arif, Ning and Mica.  The Horizon Club team was also excellent. Thanks to Sherie, Ivan and Ella. We have enjoyed Horizon Club evening canapes. Food and drinks offerings were of great quality.  Breakfast buffet was endless! Great food selection.  Thank you Shangri-La.  Will be back soon!",5,September 2019,
Absolutely amazing stay 10/10!,Holly Y,"We stayed for 5 nights here and the whole experience was wonderful. I emailed in advance to let them know the trip was for my mum's 60th birthday and they really went above and beyond to make her feel special. We got upgraded from the Tower Wing to Valley Wing and they had a birthday cake ready in the room, which was a lovely gesture. Mica accompanied us to the room to make sure everything was perfect and even gave us an framed photo of us as a nice souvenir.   The room was spotless and the service throughout our stay was outstanding. Would definitely stay here again!",5,September 2019,
My oasis in Singapore,BobM08,"I stayed here a couple of times this year for short business trips, the most recent being this month (Sept 2019).  The stay was, as usual, efficient, friendly, comfortable and personable.  The hotel had my preferred pillow ready on my bed, so it eliminated the hassle of trying to arrange this which I often do in other hotels.  I had also arranged for a delivery from the Apple online store during my stay, and I advised the concierge about it when I checked in.  It arrived when I was out for all day meetings, and the package was on the desk in my room waiting for me when I got back at night.  Efficiency.  My wife and I also stayed here for prolonged visits a couple of times late last year, and we absolutely loved the hotel, its gardens, the breakfast offerings, the service and…",5,September 2019,
Experience,Lars P,"Nice and welcoming hotel at the end or Orchard road. Warm welcome, with very pleasant handling after 21 hours of flight. I was delighted to share my time in this hotel. If I may add some thoughts: Please think about breakfast room, because it is so loud and noisy, hard to stand. As well it looks like battlefield after rush time.  In total it is a nice place to rest and enjoy. Thank you.",5,September 2019,
Purely excellent,Silje,"It was just purely perfect. Everything was thought of and the staff were just incredibly lovely in every possible way that they could think of.  Honestly we were so sad to leave! Best features were: . . . . 🍼 family pantry on our family floor. It included everything you can think of from prams to car seats to high chairs to nappies (yes free nappies!!!) Wetwipes and toys, toothpaste, toothbrushes, nappy creams and much more! Travelling with a baby just became stress free!! 🍼 the family floor even featured these cute little sculptures of animals which Ezra loved every time he got off the lift and free apples in a brown which he ate every day! 🍼 our bedroom had a toddler bed in the window inside a tipee tent. He loved this and slept in it every evening 🍼 a full size fridge was…",5,September 2019,
"Excellent, outstanding stay",skantown13152,"I had another excellent stay at the Shangri-La. The staff, as usual, were phenomenal. Friendly, went out of their way to accommodate. The restaurants were A+ in terms of food and service. The one small thing I would say is that in the Garden Wing, my room did not have a traditional desk - only a round glass table which I worked at most days. In the future I would request that I be put in a room that has a working desk. Other than that - an extremely great stay and look forward to my return.",5,September 2019,
Mr Goh,M_Not_M,Rooms clean and very nicely decorated   Bright and cheerful and clean  There were 2 of us. We were there for a corporate event. Very pleasant stay.  Toilet is clean and well equipped. Will come back again.,4,September 2019,
True resort in Singapore,Jacat500,Shangri La is a true oasis in the city. I only wish I didn't have to work all day every day and could've enjoyed the hotel more. The hotel lobby is subtle but still stunning - particularly the garden wall above the lobby bar. The rooms are of course spacious and well appointed. Buffet is as you would expect dependably good food. I ate at Origin Grill and Waterfall restaurant and my meals were excellent (in particular the profiteroles at Waterfall!). The pool is stunning and I did squeeze in time to swim a couple of times. It's even heated so the water isn't a cold shock but is still sufficiently refreshing.,5,September 2019,
Exceptional!,Gaby_and_Kim,There are not enough words to describe how brilliant the Shangri-La is.   From the moment you step in the staff are extraordinary. They go out of their way to assist in any manner.   Already outside the Porters welcome you warmly. The Reception staff greet you with a smile and are so fabulously amazing through out the entire stay. The concierge team - brilliant.  The staff in all restaurants are delightful. The food fabulous and the breakfast extensive and great.    It's a stunningly beautiful hotel in a fabulous location. The pool is superb. Large and spacious and in such a magical setting.   The room is fantastic and extremely comfortable and if you can (like us) book a Balcony room with a pool view. It's Beautiful!  Even the hairdresser at the hotel is extraordinary.   So…,5,September 2019,
Outstanding hotel,Spiritualtravel... S,The hotel is famous by its name and we booked the same through our travel agent.  The city is clean but the hotel is super cleaned. Staff are well behaved and the rooms no complaints at all. Pool is unique in the world and we really miss the hotel as we are back home. Thanks to the management,5,September 2019,
Super hotel in a great location,Janice C,We stayed for 3 nights at the Shangri-La before moving to an apartment to stay with my daughter and family who came over from New Zealand. We had previously stayed at the chain in Bangkok and we were delighted with our visit in Singapore. The Horizon Club room was beautifully appointed and we enjoyed the amenities in the Club lounge where the staff were attentive and helpful. The swimming pool is a lovely feature and very large by Singapore standards. This is a very nice family hotel - prveious visits to Singapore have been to the Fullerton and the Fairmont and the formwer is possible a better choice for couples. Nevertheless we had a lovely stay and would return with the family.,5,June 2019,
yay for us !,Natalie,i wish i could have stayed longer in shang SG. 2 nights isn't enough for the good service and delicious food . thumbs up. the buffet is so good. i wish they offer free shuttle services to tour around city but however it doesn't affectvthe overall stay,4,May 2019,
Excellent Service!,1xins,"A big Thank-you to duty manager, Pierre Cheng, and Mila from Service center who took all the trouble to help me locate a missing notebook. We had a business appointment with guesses from overseas at Rose Veranda. The day after, my colleagues’s notebook with important (&confidential) notes went missing. After searching the office up and down, we realized that the notebook could have been left at the restaurant. Both of the nice ladies from Shangri-La rendered their assistance immediately which is truly appreciated! They put themselves in customers’ position with no hesitation, no matter it’s a notebook or a more “valuable” item. Shangri-La never fail me!",5,September 2019,
Can’t wait to be back!,Cinnamoncrunch,Beautiful refurbished rooms which are well-appointed and have everything you need+ friendly service throughout the hotel. Housekeeping does a wonderful job with refreshing the rooms daily! Our only complaint is that the gym is antiquated and needs an upgrade to complement the rest of the hotel (machines are outdated and maybe more callisthenics equipment could be added).,5,September 2019,
Amazing stay,akhil k,Amazing and comfortable stay from the reception till the end. Got an early check in very comfortably. The rooms were neat and spacious. Beds were really comfortable. Washrooms had a bathtub separate than the bath area and was nicely spacious. The best part was the food. Amazing spread be it for the breakfast or lunch. The taste was not that great atleast for the Indian food which I can vouch for. Tasted continental stuff as well.  Desserts were just amazing and ample. Liked the sorbets and the geleto they have,5,September 2019,
Personal Trainer at the Gym,Jeanette,"With all the delicious food, I needed to workout and personal trainer Jason helped. He is extremely approachable after a quick analysis he managed to tailor each session according to my needs and limitations. They were enjoyable and fun with new routines. He has an extensive knowledge on the human anatomy. He is passionate and finds great fulfilment in seeing progress for his clients.",5,September 2019,
Waterfall Ristorante Italiano,Patricia L.,"It was a different take on Italian buffet for lunch. Everything was very fresh, clean and most loved dishes are available. Also the cleanliness and service of the restaurant was great.  They offer fresh pasta too which are made in a station in front of us.  I got intrigued with their a la carte menu since their buffet was spot on.  I called on one of their cooks that always strolls around the place and checking the food and I asked which one is best. Ms. Carolyn suggested the seafood pasta and true enough it was one of the best I have ever had.  I will be back for more dining and ambiance experience at Shangri la Orchard. Especially the restaurant.  Cheers!",5,August 2019,
Superb hospitality from concierge,Lynn quek,"My family and friends were at Shangri la Singapore  to dine at The Line. After dinner we approached the concierge, Johnny at the lobby to help us to take a photo. He not only kindly obliged, but even recommended to assist to take more than 1 shot at various spots that were ""Shangri-la signature"" in the lobby. After which, he proceeded to engage with my child and gave her toy. It was excellent service given that we only required a simple photo. But he went above and beyond to put a smile on his guests. It is truly a privilege to have him as your staff. For recognition purpose, I was there on 9 September at around 9.45pm.  Thanks Johnny! You have given us memories of a lifetime in the few photos.

Memorable to the detail,Winarto,"This is a much delayed review for a night staycation that my wife and 6 years old daughter went 3 months ago in June 2019.  I'd like to commend the staff at check-in counter at that time. My wife was queueing for checking-in and it was busy afternoon with a lot of people queuing. My wife stayed in the queue and had to watch my daughter at the same time. The staff recognized this and they gave them priority. To my daughter's delights, they gave her a squirrel plush toy named ""chubby"". They also upgraded the room with tent which my daughter loves it so much to play in the room.",5,June 2019,

Very memoriable, pleasant and nice experience. We decided to have dinenr at NAMI. We ordered sushi omakase and the food was delicious.

Service way beyond the call of duty. 6 stars,Hnarula,"Disclosure: I am Golden Circle Diamond member  Checked into the Shangrila hotel. Had booked a garden wing room but as I wanted to use my suite upgrade certificate, they gave me a room in the tower wing.  Suite was very nice, a tad smaller than other suites I have stayed in, but very well appointed. As a GC Diamond member, checkin was in the room, which was quick and by a very friendly member of the checkin staff.  Next day at midnight my wife and daughter arrived, and my daughter was staying in her own room a few doors from my room. I spoke to her when she arrived, and we agreed to meet for breakfast the next morning at 9.30.

One of my favorite hotel in the world,FeliciaJX,"My husband and I with our 6 years old , checked in to their Family Deluxe Room for a 3 nights stay. I must say we enjoyed very much. First, the room has a very lovely tent (as their child bed), and specially dedicated amenities for the child, example, organic baby tooth paste and brush, branded shower cream and lotion for babies, a stool, small bath rob and small room slippers. Their room is clean and the bed and pillow is fine. They separated the family rooms floors with other, So the other guests with no children will not be effected. This is very sweet. On top of that, as they found out this month is my birthday month, they even give me a cake and a bottle of wine for free! The really go the extra mile.

"Top notch service, quality fittings and fixtures ",SeahCS,"Stayed at the Horizon Club for one night. It was a fantastic experience.   Spacious room - king sized bed, bath tub, walk-in shower, glass closet, and a work desk with a view overlooks the greenery and bungalows nearby. L’Occitane toiletries add an additional touch of luxury.  The bed deserves a special mention! Sinking into the plush mattress and duvet was a heavenly feeling. Claiming that I slept like a baby through the night is not an exaggeration.  The Horizon Club was wonderful. Warm and professional service from the staff. The kitchen uses high quality produce for the food. Good selection of breads, cheeses, and wine. Iberico ham was freshly sliced - savory, with a hint of sweetness. Nothing rancid.   The desserts deserve special mention - kueh lapis (local layered cake)…",5,September 2019,

Valley wing room 953 checked in 5th sept for two nights,bonita c,"Hmmm, not sure what to say, perhaps disappointed. There were many things that started to add up to what I thought would be a pampered holiday, as my sister and I were there for a celebration. Upon arriving in a taxi, the doormen were not attentive with us, nor our luggage, they were more concerned with keeping the taxi for another guest. There was a bit of chaos there. Walking into the hotel, no receptionist was there (why bother us to ask what time we arrive) we stood there waiting for a while in an empty lobby (private valley wing lobby) standing there like silly ducks.

Shangrila hospitality,Wycliffe,"Valley Wing, Garden Wing and Tower Wing all have their own and different characters and I would usually stay in the Tower Wing when on business as I feel that it is more suitable for work purposes.  There is no doubt that there are many good hotels in SG.  But the one and most important distinguishing feature of Shangr-La is their ""signature"" hospitality.  The genuine, helpful, warm, friendly but professional but service is what you can and will receive.  Shangri-La is my home.   During this visit, I have spent many hours in the hotel and the outlets (namely Origin and Waterfall).  Remember to ask the Chef Daniel from Waterfall for the special menu of the day.  I had a grilled fish last time and the only complaint I had was that my stomach space was too small for another one. …",5,August 2019,

Until the next day this hotel concierge and another staff manage to track my trip to this lady driver who with gladness happy to see me happy that I have it back.  Thank you so much!

A delight!,erv t,"I have stayed her many times. I am retired now and my memories of my stays are still strong. I loved the hotel, the pools and I ate at The Line almost every day at least 1x. I would go jogging to the Arboretum that was close by and then relax by the pool. It is in a good location and I would walk up and down Orchard either by myself. I was so glad that I brought my wife on one of my longer stays. I would also go to the Shangri-La on Sentosa but I don't think I ever spent the night. I would jog around Sentosa (not too far, ~4-5 miles) then come back and eat at the hotel and lay by their pool for awhile. I hope to come back soon if I can convince my wife :)",5,October 2018,
Second time in Valley Wing,sport53uk,"We revisited the Shangri La after a cruise, we stayed in the Valley Wing as we did in 2007, nothing has changed since our last visit and is immaculately kept. We had afternoon tea followed by champagne and then gin and tonics with canapés  There is a reserved sun bed area reserved for Valley Wing guests but unfortunately we did observe other residents from the Garden Wing using the beds, not the hotels fault but the ignorance of other guests. Still our No 1 hotel in Singapore",5,March 2019,

The warm welcome we received at check-in felt as though we were coming home and we looked forward to the rest of our stay which was splendid.

Five star at its best,padstar4753,"Yet another seamlessly exceptional stay at the Shangri La Singapore.  To say this is my hotel of choice when visiting Singapore is an understatement.  It is as if there are no other hotels in Singapore to consider.

This stay was no different and in fact the staff went above and beyond,  a room upgrade,  requests promptly answered and fulfilled,  impeccably presented and serviced room and a special to the staff at Waterfall for a memorable dining experience, thank you Roy,  Gwen and John.  Although I cannot remember her name,  the lady that checked me in set the tone…",5,September 2019,
Business visit to Singapore,Snehvaib,Loved the hospitality and the overall experience. The staff is very courteous and attention to details is really nice. The food spread is also very good for breakfast. The location is very convenient and easy to get around. Highly recommended.,5,September 2019,
Probably the best hotel in Singapore with amazing Kids Club and Water Zone,AJJourneyMan,"Having moved from a disappointing hotel, we were greeted and treated with high levels of service. Having been here before it was great to feel the warm, professional, quality yet casual service, attention and hospitality. Stayed her with my wife and 3 children under 7 in 2 interconnecting rooms. Amazing pool time even in the rain, walkable to the shops and restaurants. There is an amazing pirate ship, splash pools and water zone for children which could be better signposted as its great! The kids club has also pushed them to lead the pack in Singapore although the cost is expensive even for a hotel guest. Breakfast great, and evening buffet. However I think adding more though to children's food options across the hotel would help parents including better kids menus. All in all…",5,February 2019,
Outstanding accommodation,Dgreen,"Felt warmly welcomed the moment we stepped into this lovely hotel. The check in staff was very professional.

Perfect way to end our honeymoon,Khurrum H,The hotel is delightfully spacious and the view from the 10th floor over-looking the garden makes Singapore look magical. Yana from the 24th floor was lovely and made us feel welcomed. Peter from the lobby was a key staff member when exploring the city and both went above their roles and are a credit to the hotel. Can't wait to return to the shang ri la as a result. Thankyou both.,5,August 2019,

Excellent service and very clean,Andy726,Excellent all round. The staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly especially Yana and all the staff at reception. The room cleaners went out of their way by opening doors and lifts for us and the hotel porters were very professional and hospitable.  As for the room... it was very clean and comfortable with had a beautiful view. The breakfast in the hotel was delicious and again the staff at breakfast couldn't do enough for us. It had something for everyone from the family area to the health section we were not left hungry!!  The entire atmostphere in the hotel was lovely and I look forward to my next stay there.,5,August 2019,

Singapore's ultimate luxe hotel,snowbunni,"Loved every moment of our stay here. We were presented with a fresh orchid upon arrival and taken to our room in the Garden Wing, which had a lovely balcony and view. A basket of fresh fruit was supplied in the room. We loved lounging around the pool - enjoying a fantastic selection of fresh drinks and healthy snacks. Other highlights included the lavish High Tea in the Rose Verandah, and the children's cookery lessons at Buds, which my daughter loved. Service was faultless throughout, staff are unfaililingly charming and helpful. We were even given a complimentary late check-out at 6pm due to a late flight leaving Singapore. Can't praise this hotel highly enough!",5,November 2018,
Staycation / Birthday celebration,Thana19,"1 of the best hotels in SG! No complaints on all aspects. Breakfast including sparkling wine was great! Bed was very comfortable and had a peaceful sleep. Valley wing room is indeed posh and elegant as advertised. If kids play area at Buds club was complimentary or at least at a lower cost, would have been perfect!",5,August 2019,
Mixed bag,Patrick U,"Room was a bit dated, for a premium hotel that felt a bit unusual. The breakfast and pool are good but the hotel is a bit far from the centre. If you are comparing with the big hotels on price then worth looking elsewhere.",3,August 2019,
Perfect Singapore vacation for family,lroe90,"Loved it! Our 5 year old loved going to Buds while we enjoyed the pool and a few drinks and snacks haha. But it's honestly like you are not in SG, we didn't want to leave the hotel and just enjoy the peace. Line is one of the best buffets I have experienced. We had a Garden Wing room, so beautiful and sitting on the balcony each morning for my Nespresso was perfect. Staff around the pool were amazing and I enjoyed a pool side massage and prosecco, it's just a great place if you really want to relax and treat yourself.",5,August 2019,
Great stay in Singapore,Julie L,"Outstanding facilities and service, great location. The rooms are pristine and clean. Was able to enjoy the lovely pool , you can have a foot massage by the pool as well. Breakfast buffet was savoury and delicious one of the best I had !  ",5,August 2019,
Exceptional experience,Pauashell,"Lovely to be back since our last visit many years ago. The food and rooms have changed tremendously. There is more variety of food and the room is more modern.

We will come back again looking for him.",5,August 2019,
The best!,Mahdy-Gil,"Exceptional hotel - we were so fortunate to be offered an upgrade.  Service impeccable, multiple dining options, great pool with at least 3 life guards at all times, beautiful gardens.  Handy to Orchard Road.  Outstanding hotel.  Our grandson didn’t want to leave!

Ultimate luxury,MershamKent,"There is luxury and then there is the Shangri-la Hotel. It is the utmost in comfort, service  and facilities. The pool is excellent and so too is the spa services. there are several restaurants all of which are very good. The breakfast is huge and the highlight is the Sunday brunch which is very popular. There is a great play area for children and tennis courts with coaching. It is an easy walk down to Orchard road but due to the heat and humidity in Singapore it is normal to get a taxi back to the hotel. There are no metro stations close to this hotel but there is a free shuttle bus that goes every hour down into the main areas of Orchard Road.",5,July 2019,
Wonderful team at reception,Joel Magadia,A wonderful experience at Shangri la Hotel Singapore. A very warm and hospitable sevice at the reception from Mica and her team. The breakfast was great. The rooms were beautiful and we were upgraded 😊 hope to come back soon.,5,August 2019,
Excellent service for a major business meeting,Alycia S,"I attended a 160 person company conference in August and was incredibly impressed with the staff, in the meeting rooms, restaurants, and in personal room service.  In particular, Risa and Yana were extraordinarily helpful in addressing a rather unusual request for support for several internal team members.  (They sourced and provided gorgeous flowers and personal notes of thanks in the rooms of key colleagues ... at the request of our senior executive who was in route from the US to Singapore at the time!). And Jing jing so cleverly noticed how I devoured the nightly chocolates even while distractedly banging away on my laptop when she came by for the turn down service, that she soon was leaving me a few extra chocolates and attending to my room with ninja-like skills.  This was…",5,August 2019,
Travel from 18 to 21/8/2019,Didier F,"It's an incredible trip at the Shangri la. All was perfect(restaurant, breakfast,swimming pool,bar, room...)and the staff so kind. I hope to come back soon. The situation in Singapour is TOP, near Orchard road and in the nice neighboor. ",5,August 2019,
Very nice and comfortable hotel,Soon I,"It is situated very close to the Orchard Road is a great location for shopping. There is a swimming pool landscaping is a good place to enjoy recreation in the city. Orchard Road has some attractions, including a daily shuttle bus running around Harbourfront station shuttles are attended by one on a weekday (Monday to Friday) morning. I and my group took a shuttle to the harbourfront, so there was a small number of people who took a taxi. Of course the fee was paid by the hotel. We enjoyed afternoon tea and cocktails in the club room. Both of them prepared more abundantly than other hotels. The night view is less than the hotels near Marina Bay, but I expect to stay at Shangri-La Hotel next time I go to Singapore again.",5,August 2019,
"Reception at Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",Jeanne-Michelle Lowe,"We would both like to extend a special 'Thank You' to Rudy at Reception, whose excellent customer service skills deserve to be recognised.

All very much appreciated as we prepare to go home. Happy memories, we wish you well.",5,August 2019,
Best Concierge,estherf877,"I had a 5 days holidays with my 4 years old niece and stayed in the Tower wing.  She enjoys so much in the pool and specially the Kids Club. Highly recommend with any kid to go and can let them play and join some classes.   As she joined the clay flower class to make a clay flower pot for her mum, she needed to pack well and bring back home. We went to Concierge for help and Johnny was so helpful for everything needed.  Even we went to Kidszania in Sentosa on next day which was suggested by Johnny and she loved and had amazing experience there. Thank you Johnny for all help. We definitely will come back next year.

The sofa beds for children in the room were so interesting as they were transformed into a tent which my kids absolutely loved! On top, I have a toddler and their Pantry in the Tower wing was amazing! They had everything you can imagine to make the stay comfortable- I borrowed their stokke stroller, stokke high chair (for the times I fed my son in the room), a bottle warmer, steriliser, bath toys, wet wipes, diapers...you name it! Their room service was also great as they never took longer than 15 min to deliver the food. The kids club (buds) was excellent and my kids loved spending a few hours there every day. Pool was great and lifeguards were super alert. Overall a very comfortable stay and I would highly recommend this hotel for people…",5,August 2019,

An excellent oasis in Singapore! A true Shangri La.,mark12121,"I stayed at this hotel for half a week, and I must say that I was impressed. I usually stay more at the downtown core area so was a little bit suspect, but Orchard is great, and the hotel is out of this world.  From check-in, to the facilities, restaurants, staff, service and bar. Everything was really amazing.  I personally do not have children, but I must say from the facilities I noticed - cooking classes for kids, a massive play area with slides, ball pit, kids club (looked cool! And for free if staying as a hotel guest!), family friendly pool - this really is the best hotel in Singapore if you have kids. Rest assured they seem to have everything to entertain, care for and cater to! I was really impressed.  The rooms - I was staying in the tower, this was booked as a…",5,August 2019,
Quite simply WOW!,Munaf G,"Trust me, when I say that I never write online reviews – this is a unique exception.  The hotel reception area is world class, with all the staff being highly professional and courteous. The only other hotel which comes even remotely close to competing with this assessment is the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi.  The people I must mention by name are Amin (doorman), Melissa (deputy duty manager) and above all else Shawn Tan (the duty manager).  After a hitch in terms of the number of beds for our party of 5 – Shawn & Melissa took personal charge to arrange for all us to move to the 2 bedroom “Singapore Suite” in the Valley Wing.  The apartment was quite simply breath taking (two huge bedrooms each with their own private dressing rooms and walk-in wardrobes), private dining room…",5,August 2019,

After asking a few times they pass is few bowls and plate in a stack and say pls distribute amongst yourself  3) asked for extra blanket for three times starting 3pm and not available till 11 pm when I started yelling  4) ask if they can help me get some tourist attractions ticket, the concierge said you better go buy it yourself because it is too much trouble if I buy for you  5) furniture and sofa in the rooms was moved by us for space reason and we are being reminded to clean and relocate the furniture before we checked out  I don’t know what happened to this hotel.

Great for the whole family,Shin,"The facilities were fantastic and the staff were friendly. It’s not exactly a central location, but they offer free shuttle service to Orchard. We opted to taxi or grab since both are cheap options in Singapore compared to other countries.   Get to the pool early as all of the good seats get taken, depending on the direction of the sun.  The kids’ water park and playground was a pleasant find. There aren’t any signs for it but it’s tucked away behind the building. ",5,August 2019,

"Shangri La, Singapore",Nadeem Muzaffar,"Great hotel although we had 2 connecting rooms it was fine for 4 nights although would have preferred a 2 bed suite (4 of us travelling together) but none were available. Rooms were clean and modern but not particularly spacious, however great location to explore Singapore from and the Shangri Lal offered everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Staff were very helpful and always willing to help. Would recommend it without a doubt.",5,July 2019,
Pure pleasure and delight,John Hough,"Was met on arrival by lobby manager ""Peter"" who gave us a friendly greeting and guidance to Valley Wing, which is the exclusive part of the hotel. The Valley Wing is pure delight with spacious rooms and delicatly furnished.The staff was extremely service minded and I loved my morning breakfast in the Summit Room, which was run by a most charming Frenchman. Afternoon Tea was served in the lobby of the Valley Wing, as well as drinks and finger sandwiches by a fantastic staff. Cannot praise the staff enough. The pool area was well attended by staff and served pool food and drinks. Life guards were present all the time. Sun chairs and towels were arranged by pool staff.

35th Wedding Anniversary,Runrig1890,"I cannot say enough about this Hotel group , they are so professional in every way and cannot do enough to ensure your complete satisfaction. The hotel itself is elegant  and so comfortable , and the little extras they put in our room for our anniversary were such a nice touch , thank you to all .

"The best hotel we have ever stayed in, an experience we will treasure for the rest of our lives",WiseTreeOwl,"Singapore itself is a wonderful place, but of all the things we experienced, our stay at the Shangri-La is one of the memories we will treasure above all else.  The staff without exception are just wonderful and they made our experience truly exceptional. Everyone went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect, many staff even referring to us by name when they saw us coming into the hotel in the evening and asking if we had a good day, something that I would never expect in such a large hotel. Specifically Vijay, the Bell Captain who always opened doors for us and checked how we were doing and Connie the breakfast pancake cook who made flower shaped pancakes for us on our last morning.  Our room was perfect with many features we had not previously seen in hotels before…",5,July 2019,
Exceptional in every way,worldtraveller10169,We had to have an unexpected stopover in Singapore due to illness so we booked online at the last minute at this hotel.   We arrived early to hopefully rest and they were amazing at accommodating us for an early check in.   All staff were fantastic with great attention to detail but special mention to the front office manager Lin for assisting us with an early room.   You will not be disappointed.,5,August 2019,

Excellent experience and highly recommend,Clo_Travel_The_World,"We stayed as a family in the suite in valley wing and tower wing respectively, the experience is really awesome. Valley wing is vintage and Tower wing is modern and new, they are nice in their own way.   Service is excellent in this hotel, I would say probably is the best in Singapore. From the moment of check-in, you can feel they really value their customers.  Highly recommend the Horizon Club, the breakfast, tea and cocktail are deluxe and really worth the extra cost for the club access. ",5,July 2019,
Wow!,Uwais H,"Amazing hotel with all the facilities you want. They really value their guests and treat them accordingly. I was especially impressed with their breakfast, they had about 12 stations for food from all parts of the world , I was really spoiled for choice.

Family Holiday and our Honeymoon,Richard W,"We stayed at the Shangri-La in Singapore from Wednesday 24 July to Wednesday 31 July 2019.  We had a Horizon Club Junior Suite as it was also a special occasion for us as we got Married two days before travelling to Singapore. Of the other 10 who came with us on holiday, 6 stayed in Horizon Executive Rooms (3) and 4 stayed in one of the 5 Themed Family Rooms. All the rooms were very comfortable and well featured.  We used the Horizon Club for Breakfast, afternoon tea (on occasion) and drinks and canapés in the evening. The food was exceptional and a lot of variety. More importantly, the staff were exceptional and even sourced some gluten free bread for one of our party.  A more extensive breakfast could be enjoyed on Level 1 as part of the Horizon club privileges.  Would I stay…",5,July 2019,
Best place to stay in Singapore for their best customer service,Godfrey_Quedz,"The place is great due to their best customer service and great food.

First class experience,socket2me,Had my first stay at the Singapore Shangri-La and was ver impressed with every part of my stay. I had to check out by 1 pm and my flight was at 9.30 pm. The staff were happy for me to use the facilities until I departed for the airport. There was a TV room with very comfortable chairs so after gym and pool I was able to get a nap in the very comfy recliners before my international flight. Highly recommend :),5,July 2019,
Great all round hotel,Jo R.,"We really enjoyed our 5 night stay at the Shangri La. The hotel is beautiful with impeccably maintained gardens and coy ponds, a generous sized pool which pleased the serious swimmer as well as the junior swimmer of the family. The kids’ play area is top quality and my daughter enjoyed the arty activities, as well as cup cake making. My facial and massage was probably the best I‘ve had at any hotel. Peter at reception made us feel very special and was incredibly kind and welcoming from the moment we entered the hotel until the moment we left. He answered all our questions and people like him make us choose Shangri La repeatedly over the world. We will definitely stay again at this hotel when returning to Singapore.",5,July 2019,
Singapore Special,Nikki,"Beautiful property grounds with numerous orchids and tropical plants. Easy access walk-in stairs to pool and outdoor jacuzzi.

Singapore’s Finest,adeelhaq77,"If you are looking to feel like royalty then Shangri-La Singapore is your place! This hotel knows how to make its guests feel important and go over and beyond in regard to their hospitality.   It’s the paying attention to the small details that makes a huge impact on your stay. We had a very efficient and quick check in, the rooms are immaculate, tastefully designed and furnished (we stayed in the junior suite which was spacious plus the room also has access to their horizon lounge which you could access through out the day).  Mr. Bao Zuo, made sure our room was perfect through out our stay.   At checkin our 8yr old was given a stuffed squirrel toy which he absolutely loves (it’s now his new travel buddy),  beds were turned down every evening and we even got bedtime chocolates -…",5,July 2019,
Not as good as expected,Melbguy3805,"Upon checking in to a king size room, was surprised to see two singles put together (see photo). They didnt even bother joiniong them up. Not something you would expect from a 5 star establishment.  Went back down stairs and told them this was unacceptable.  After a couple of minutes, and him checking with his manager  we were moved to another room. As my bags were in  the first room, it took them roughly 30 minutes to transfer my bags. I had to visit reception again to get this done. Not good aervice, especially from a hotel that prides itself on service. The pool  was good. The bed was a bit harder then i am used to but ok. Overall, would stay somewhere else next time.",3,July 2019,
Outstanding visit,83SJP,"We had a fabulous holiday. Special thanks to all the staff in the Valley Wing including everyone at the front door, reception, lobby lounge and the restaurant: special thanks to Hussain, Raja and Edward.

great for familes,david255060,"We stayed in a beautiful room, but the piece de resistance was the double room my son doaughter in law and their 5 and 7 year old children had.

"very good location, great hotel",global citizen,"My second review on this hotel. Great location, very friendly employees, we prefer the tower rooms as it is well renovated. will certainly return again.  One big disappointment is the Horizon club. While the setting, the offering is absolutely superb, the evening shift employees have an attitude that simply shouldn't be acceptable in any five star hotel. Same gentlemen as the last previous visits, and same dissatisfaction. One feels that he is in a constant bad mood and not welcoming at all. Removing empty plates, glasses from table ? Nope, he doesn't do it.   I am surprised that he did not have extra training what hospitality is all about.",5,July 2019,
Perfect Vacation,neilinbarton,"My wife and I stayed at the Shangri La, for our summer holiday, in one of the Garden Wing rooms with a pool view. I can not speak highly enough of this hotel. Everything from arrival, check inn, room, pool, breakfast and facilities were first class.   The rooms are spacious, modern and well serviced, with fresh fruit and water replenished each day. Although we had a pool view they are extremely quiet. Best nights sleep I have had for quite some time, being a frequent traveler this is a rare treat.  The location is ideal, with a short walk to Orchard Road and ten minutes to the nearest subway station, making travelling around very easy.  The service in every area was also excellent and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly. If we ever needed anything in the room, it was…",5,July 2019,
Best 5 star hotel in Singapore,Mackenziewillz,"Thank you Shangri-La for the amazing stay experience. Service was superb from the first moment entered the hotel. Check-in by staff stacey was really efficient and prompt. As we arrive early morning room was not available but we were told we can use the hotel facilities and Swimming pool. When we headed earlier but to the reception to enquirer if room was ready, ms stacey has recognised us and greeted us with smile. We felt recognised as more than a guest at the hotel! Plus point of hotel is there is a kids playground at the first floor, and the facilities seems one of the best compared to other five star hotel. Would be back again in the future.",5,July 2019,
My home away from home,Ric P,"I just love this hotel. I have been staying here for nearly 20 years. The staff are really what make it: from the smiles my uniformed doormen on arrival, to the very attentive staff in the Horizon Club.  Food in any of the restaurants is excellent. The new Origin steak house is wonderful. The timeless and reliable Shang Palace Chinese does wonderful Peking duck. In Waterfall you get the best Italian. The Line, while chaotic at busy times, does a great breakfast and a magnificent seafood and champagne buffet on weekends.  Come and stay soon. You will not be disappointed. ",5,July 2019,
This is what customer experience is all about,"Chris J ""Mohawk"" Reed","This is what I call customer service! It's a Singaporean tradition to have ""staycations"", where you basically have a holiday at a 5 star hotel in....Singapore!   Over my 10 years here I have stayed everywhere and experienced all kinds of hotels.   3 years ago I stayed at the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts Singapore and had wonderful hospitality, sitting in the garden, working, drinking free flow champagne all day (as that was part of the staycation package).  3 years later I am staying at the newly refurbished Tower Wing.  I walked into the Club Lounge and Baoling welcomed me with an amazing smile and said welcome back....not in a I see that you come to lots of Shanrgi-La's and I have to say this kind of way.. but in a genuine way and then put it in context.  …",5,July 2019,

Nothing was too much trouble the staff are so helpful, the rooms spotless and the food just sublime. ",5,July 2019,
Still the standard in Singapore,Josef S,"I come to Shangri-La in Singapore since 1986. It was at that time one of the only 5-star superior hotels with a more than excellent standard in service and accommodation.This has continued until today. The only negative point I can say is, that their award system ""Golden Circle"" and their reservation system did not work properly in my first 20 years with Shangri-La Hotels (Singapore and many other I have been), and so at least 20 Stays were not counted. Nevertheless I like Shangri-La and will come back - however certainly in less quantity as I am retired now and don't travel as much as before.",5,July 2019,
Wonderful 9 day stay.....,Todd C,"Spent a great family/business trip last week in the Garden wing.....facilities and gardens make you feel like you're out of the city, swimming pool is large, but water is a little too warm......Dolores, a breakfast waitress,  was the best example of so many great service people at the hotel, from check in to the restaurants and bellmen, inexpensive taxis to most city locations, $13-20 usually.....loved it",5,July 2019,
Incredible hotel,Nick,We arrived badly injured from another country but was very amazed by the assistance from one of your elderly staff by the name of Peter from the lobby.

Fantastic Hotel with amazing customer service,Joey Ricketts,"I have previously stayed here in 2011 but kind of forgot how good it is, My last visit to Singapore I stayed at a different Hotel and unfortunately had to wait until nearly 4pm to get in my room after arriving at the hotel at 8am after the overnight flight from Melbourne.We arrived at the Hotel at the same time of 8am and although our room was not ready we were encouraged to go to the gym shower area which in itself is amazing. me and my wife both refreshed wandered down to Orchard Rd for Breakfast,On our return Rudy went over and above to get us settled and checked in as quickly as possible,Shang Ri-La is next level in Customer Service and I will never stay in another hotel whilst I'm in Singapore!!",5,July 2019,

From Bala who greeted us with a warm smile at the door, to the knowledgeable Mongolia costumed warrior, It was an absolute delight to be greeted each morning by the genuinely smiling staff at the Lime Restaurant. I don't remember the NAME of the young lady who greeted us each morning, but I remember her smile. Some of the staff had a suit/skirt (American style) but this one had an ear piece and a blue shirt (no suit). Please give them my greetings.

Four night stopover,Kirsty M,"We were thrilled with the service from start to end. We splashed out and spent 130SGD on the transfer service after we arrived from an overnight flight from London. It was money well spent (after flying with twin 3yos). This service includes being met as you get off the aircraft. We were then helped with our 12 pieces of luggage and escorted to our transport. When we arrived at Shangri-La hotel there were several staff members awaiting our arrival. Our brains were very blurry so to have such exceptional service, including two soft toy squirrels for our daughters and carrying out the check in process in our room was greatly appreciated.

This was the main thing that stood out to us- although we weren’t on a business trip, we truly felt like the staff treated us equally to everyone else. This is rare to find in many hotels who clearly know which of their customers are paying the top price! The staff are a credit to the hotel for making us feel special! We ate at Origins which was excellent and I have separately reviewed. We also thought the breakfast was very good and plenty of choice.

Amazing for families!,hotelfanatic65,"We were traveling with another couple and their young child on this occasion and decided to check out the Shang because we had heard about their new family floor. We were absolutely blown away! From a family concierge to kids toiletries and a full-on laundry area, this is the only place to stay in the city if you're traveling with kids. You can also rent strollers, high chairs and more if necessary. We were shown some of the themed family rooms but stayed in a regular family room. This will be enough for most families. The hotel has made good use of the bay window for the kids extra bed.

The gym is huge, and has a great steam room/sauna.

Exemplary service,Daniel H,"The Shangri La Horizon Club experience was amazing and made this visit really good value for money. Each day we enjoyed afternoon tea or a generous three hour cocktails and canapes at the Club rooms, all complementary. The food at the Line Buffet was delicious with so many options to choose from. Our Deluxe King Room was spacious and up to date. The staff were so generous. We were able to use the hotel health club to have a shower and freshen up after we checked out so that we were fresh for our late night flight.

Our rooms were on the family floor and I was pleasantly surprised that they were larger than I expected, with a daybed under the window The grounds are gorgeous and it's worth it to spend some time exploring the impeccable gardens. Every member of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet has an amazing selection of everything you can imagine and was excellent. The location is great and just a short walk to the shops on Orchard Road. We have traveled a lot and this hotel is up there with my favorites.",5,July 2019,
Work trip that felt like a holiday,TamaraJapp,"What a great experience from start to finish at the Shagri-La in Orchard. Spent the week there for a company offsite and so spent almost the entire time at the hotel. Firstly it feels more like a resort - and I would highly recommend the venue for work related functions that need you to unplug and reset your thinking or team dynamics.   General Service: truly excellent and polished - even room maintenance was a great experience.  Room Service: great menu, very extensive across tastes including Sushi options. Good quality for money.

I would like to give a special mention to all of the staff as they were so welcoming and helpful.

Lovely property and great location,Linda P,"Only 30 minutes from Changi International airport and close to Orchard Road shopping with free shuttle to the ION shopping mall. Friendly and helpful staff. Great daily breakfast and lunch buffet at The Line with numerous choices. Relaxing spa (was able to book a massage within an hour after arriving at the hotel). Very nice pool view from my Tower Wing room. Loved that the Front Desk staff told me not to be alarmed if I saw someone in scuba gear in the pool after 10 pm - they were doing maintenance. Great afternoon ""Tea"" daily in the Horizon Club Lounge   For the meeting portion of our stay: Lotus I & II were a great size for our group of 20. Attentive Banquet staff, and the Sales team checked in regularly to make sure everything was running smoothly.",4,July 2019,
Great for a family vacation,SimsimSAB,"We booked a themed room during our last stay in April and it was fab for the kids. Everything is made for your little ones to be happy and enjoy their stay beyond words! The parents room is OK but a bit small, not to mention the bathroom...i felt a bit like Alice in Wonderland when she gets too big for the house.  The hotel staff was very nice, the ladies and the gentleman at the kids club were amazing and very reliable. We absolutely loved their mini restaurant for the little guests.  I would like to mention one person's skills though; Sheela at The Concierge desk who was absolutely fabulous. She helped us with the kids when we left them at The Club and left for an appointment, she advised us so well on our activities, booked our zoo tickets and kept on offering her help ever…",4,April 2019,
A fantastic hotel that never fails us,Lavender,"We always feel like coming home every time we are here. In particular the reception staff Irene was very helpful. This time we got to know peter from the foyer. We regret not knowing him earlier. He is an exceptionally knowledgeable, helpful and friendly person. He treats us more than just a guest. In fact we felt like family members. He indeed is an asset to Shangrila hotel. From the bottom of our heart, we are looking forward to seeing him again on our next and subsequent visits.",5,July 2019,

Why stay anywhere else,nelliebob,To celebrate a special anniversary and birthday we chose to return to the Shangri la. The refurbishment of the Tower wing and Horizon Club lounge is excellent. As usual staff in the Horizon Club lounge are excellent. Food and drinks are spot on. Recommend upgrading to Hirizon Club. Worth every penny.,5,July 2019,
Perfect stay,Megan A,"My sister and I spent a few nights (again) at this superb hotel to visit my daughter. We were upgraded to a Valley Wing room. It was perfect! Have previously enjoyed Horizon Club rooms but this was even more special. As always staff were professional, welcoming and friendly. Plan to return soon. ",5,July 2019,
An exceptional experience,Derrick Justin,"Stayed with the hotel for a biz related trip on July, gotta say was pretty impressed with the architecture and service over here.  Under the recommendation of Stacy during check-in, I had decided to upgrade myself to club room and never looked back after since. Club lounge comes with one of the best view of sg skyline and definite good spread of buffet breakfast, the cocktail is definitely a huge plus too. Giving a special thanks to Syra whom I met her at line for being so attentive and polite and also Stacy for being always so friendly and approachable, addressing by name each time you saw me and the travel tips you gave was indeed a blessing to my mundane work trip. Would definitely recommend the hotel! Cheers!",5,July 2019,
Excellent,Snooker,"We stayed at the Shangrila and were treated like royalty.  Room, food, drinks, facilities and staff service were excellent.

A memorable stay in Sangri-La Singapore,Rajendra Kankaria,"Sangri-La Singapore stands out as the best hotel in Singapore in my opinion because of many reasons. The beauty of the property cannot be captured in photos, the hospitality of the staff makes you feel absolutely special! I've stayed in 5 star hotels in over 10 countries and by far this has been the best experience. I stayed at Sangri-La for one day and would've definitely extended my stay had it not been for my already bought flight tickets.  The breakfast buffet is one of the most spread out I've had till now. The rooms are absolutely gorgeous and spacious. A warm and kind welcome started with Ms Suriany at my check in, and was enjoyable all the way till my checkout. This trait is exuberant in all the staff. The staff is welcoming, hospitable and courteous at the same time.  …",5,July 2019,
Wonderful hotel,Liz R,"This is our first visit to this fabulous hotel!! The staff are so attentive and friendly and cater to all your needs.

Truly Shangri-La! Best Hotel in Singapore for a staycation,deechoy63,"My second time here for a staycation and it’s even better than the first time. Service was impeccable from check in to check out. It’s hard to mention anyone in particular as they were all exceptional. The Tower Wing room was large, clean and well equipped. Had all meals at the restaurants as Expedia booked rooms offered a 15% discount which makes eating in attractive. Thank you all staff for a great stay. Will be back. ",5,July 2019,
"Exceptional, service, location, design",Ginny,"One of my favorites! Stayed in a 1 bedroom tower suite. Super comfortable bed, pillow menu ( always a fave!) Every thoughtful detail adds up to a phenomenal stay. From every bathroom amenity you could require ( replenished daily) to the iconic Singapore views from the Horizon Club. Breakfast in the club has a decent and varied selection daily, and a Happy Hour with a different array of treats each day. Service is consistently excellent in each area of the hotel. From being escorted to the Horizon Club for an early check in, to our children having an absolute ball in the Kids Club. The incredible vertical garden in the lobby is also a stunning feature.",5,May 2019,
Excellent service!,Jessie Tan,"I stayed at SGL for a night. The kids enjoyed Buds tremendously. Would like to commend and extend my appreciation to Asst Director of Rooms Samuel Dhanraj. I checked in at 11am. On learning that I had to check out early the next morning, he offered me another room which was available immediately and even allowed me to tour the room before making a decision. Samuel went the extra mile and I managed to maximize my stay!",5,July 2019,
The Line buffet dining,Phil712,"We've used this hotel buffet many times in the past and it just seems to get better! The choice, as always, is fantastic, there's something to suit every taste. The table service is wonderfully efficient and everything seems to run like clockwork under the watchful eye of Hatim Zubair, the F & B Manager who made each visit seem like visiting an old friend. There is one criticism however which is not only unique to this place, many others also do not know how to cook Brussel sprouts, always uncooked and rock hard. Why? And why is there no gravy with the Yorkshire puddings and roast beef? Yes, they have jus but jus is jus and gravy is gravy. If these issues could be addressed I would consider my life to be a life well lived. :-) It must be good as my wife has visited four times in…",5,July 2019,
Service trumps stress,Barry M,"A three day business trip to Singapore after a long flight should have been quite stressful. I went home more relaxed than when I arrived due to the comfort of the rooms, quality of the catering and excellence of the staff. I cannot speak too highly of this experience and recommend this hotel to business and holiday travelers. It is also clear that children are welcomed and entertained and numerous families were enjoying the child friendly facilities.",5,July 2019,
Best Hotel Ever!,rowntra,"Wow!! This hotel is nothing short of amazing. My daughter and I arrived for a short stay at the Shangri La enroute to the UK. The staff are incredibly attentive and we were given an upgrade to the Valley Wing. These rooms exude old world elegance and are incredibly spacious. The chandelier was a nice touch. The dressing area was a welcome addition in the room as it gave you a place to put your belongings without having stuff strewn all over. The Valley Wing has a complimentary high tea and canapés which was such a lovely touch. My daughter loves Buds, the kids club area. We spent plenty time in the indoor play area. The lobby areas are spectacular, especially the valley wing. I have already told friends how fantastic this place is and how it caters to the needs of adults and…",5,July 2019,
Always pleasure to be back,Simplylife14,"2 stays within the last 3 weeks total 11 nights, the usual warm welcome from doorman team and also at Shang Palace was the highlight of our stay. The experience at Origin Grill was a newly added to-do list when in Singapore. The buffet at The Line was good at dinner but a la carte was poor with quality and truth in the menu. Love the concept at the Lobby Lounge to focus on local heritage. Keep going.  The not so good is the experience with laundry service which said our simple cloth is to thick to wash. This incident did not make a good impression as it should not be from Shangri-La. In the book Moments of Truth by Jan Carlzon, which I consider one of the most important books written on customer service. Carlzon’s definition of a Moment of Truth in business is, “Any time a…",4,June 2019,
Shangri-La is back to its best! Superb!,Annie_M_3131,"We've been staying at the Shangri-La for over 10 years. The service is superb and the facilities are excellent! If you'd like a relaxing and quality break, this is the place to stay. It's quiet but still within walking distance of Orchard Road (and it has its own shuttle bus). The gardens are spectacular, as is the pool area (where you can order delicious drinks, food and have a foot massage all at the same time). The rooms are clean and well-serviced, with fruit and tea/coffee provided. The cake and bread shop in the lobby is also a must to visit to buy a treat. If you visited a year or two ago and found it a bit busy or had a few problems, give it another go. It's back to it's best now. A stand-out for this hotel are the staff. Special mention to Marcus Chua, who remembered my…",5,July 2019,

"Great Staff and large room, great pool and one of the best club lounges!!",TheOllster,"The Shangri-La is a great hotel which allows you to escape the busyness of Singapore but still be fairly central.  As soon as you walk in you sense the quality with a huge foyer and very attentive staff.  We went for a Horizon Club tower twin which was a decent size 38sqm which is located in the same building as reception, the garden wing has bigger rooms but is more expensive).  The room looks to have been newly refurbished and was modern with large LCD TV, Nespresso machine, fridge etc.  The bathroom has all the amenities and includes a bath and shower again nicely modernised.

All of my sisters were impressed from the way they treated us, like family. Everyone was so warm and made me feel special. The food is spectacular as is the ambience, but what really sets the restaurant apart from all the others are their staff who really reaches out to connect with you. This is of course all possible as the team is well led by Andreano, who hosted us and who was such a delight! Thank you all so much!",5,July 2019,
Amazing hotel with superb service,Darren Lopez,"Stayed in the garden wing late last month with couple of friends. The room was indeed spacious and comes with a big balcony, something rare in other hotels met by the land scarcity of Singapore.   For service wise, it's definitely big plus, was escorted by Ariff, he's attentive and humorous. Check in by Stacey was efficient and prompt, her professionalism enable her to engage small talk and even advise us on the best view to get sunset shot within the hotel since we were all photohoilic.

Gems Hunting,vincybie,"This was our very first time staying at the Shangri-la Singapore. It was established in 1971 and partly refurbished in 2017. Surprisingly, it was very well maintained in all aspects. The entrance and the lobby area was spacious and elegant. There were also some unique artworks and crafted plantations which, were nicely presented around the welcome area. It will definitely tempt you to turn on your camera mode.   We were being assigned to the refurbished side (I think) of the property.  However, we didn't quite enjoy the weird shape of the room and my gut was telling me I would not have a restful night if I stayed in that room. They were kind enough to move us to the garden wing which was a normal sized room with a balcony facing the pool. Our porter, Elvis, was helpful…",5,June 2019,

Wonderful stay,thejourneysofar,"We enjoyed a week here staying in a Junior Suite to give us more room as we were travelling with Master 5.  Unknown to us at booking, this included access to the Horizon Club which provides daily afternoon tea and canapes plus drinks. And we enjoyed it everyday! The Club has a separate area for families which was also fantastic.  The suite was spacious and exactly as described. There was a small kitchenette and the fridge was large enough to add our own drinks too. The king bed was super comfortable and the sofa bed for Master 5 was equally so.   The pool area was ideal for all and surrounded by lush gardens which made you feel like you could be anywhere. We only ate once poolside and were disappointed but this is only a minor thing.

Great Hotel,craigeelinks,"We stayed 4 nights in June.  We arrived late and had a quick check in.  Due to our status we were entitled to an up-grade if available, however there wasn't one available.  Our room was an unusual design with the bed on an angle.  We didn't like the layout it was difficult to move around, it was lovely and clean. The view from the room was nice.  The staff were wonderful especially in the Horizon Club lounge.  This hotel is extremely busy, especially the Foyer.  Heaps of choices from the buffet breakfast. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night it was OK. We easily walked to Orchard Road from here, however there is a shuttle, but we never used it.  We would stay again, but I would prefer a different room type.",4,June 2019,
Amazing Hotel with Minor Criticism,Thethans,"Stayed in the Garden wing over looking the pool level 6. Access to the Club also.

Before moving forward I must make a special acknowledgement of Vivien Soh, she was absolutely amazing.  She is the duty manager I had the pleasure of being helped by many many times throughout the stay.

More deserving of a 5 stars hotel,Ann_Liu,"Booked a weekend stay in the hotel and the service rendered by the team was immaculate. Every detail from the check in to check out was done in excellence. Have stayed in various hotel for similar price and much less satisfying service compared to shangrila. Stayed with my 2 sons and celebrated my husband’s birthday. Without any prompting, amenities for kids were provided and a birthday cake was a fine touch. Service was top notch at the reception, buds, restaurant, the pool and when we were leaving.

From the moment of arrival, we were greeted by both the doorman and reception staff who kindly took my luggage and guided me to the reception desk. The front desk staff were very friendly and made sure we had refreshments and also gave a little toy to my son which he absolutely adores.

Shangri-La's flagship hotel did not disappoint,Victor,"My whirlwind Asia trip took me to four Shangri-La hotels: Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, and lastly Kuala Lumpur.  Out of the four, Shangri-La Singapore offered the most consistent service, cleanest rooms, most pleasant staff and management (Beijing's management was also very good), and finally, assistance that went beyond the hotel's physical boundaries.  At Shangri-La Singapore, I was offered access the Horizon Lounge on top of the hotel. It was a great experience that served as the anchor point between my outings to the city. I would take my laptop to the lounge to finish some work, and end the day with happy hour if I am not sight-seeing or meeting friends in the city.

On one trip we were able to check out later and continue use of club benefits (also very much appreciated). Spread at club lounge is good and delicious.   Areas of improvement: pool area is a bit basic for a 5 star hotel. The buffet breakfast is very cafeteria-like and too busy, tables are too close too each other.   Will we stay again? Definitely!

Thanks Shangri-la for looking after me for the last 4 days and now making me want to return. You have a great team everyone is so friendly, no wonder your hotel is so busy. Thank you ",5,June 2019,
Waterfall Ristorante Italiano,Moses L,"I had a memorable and enjoyable time with my wife. All thanks to Tonny, Gwen & Andreano's exemplary service! They paid attention to every minute details. Their dedication to providing a top-notch service is applaudable. They ecen provided a complimentary birthday cake for my wife. I highly recommend WaterFall Ristorante Italiano to every couple who is looking for a romantic night out :)",5,June 2019,
Hotel,Claire Childe,Hotel has a huge hall overlooking a nice all-day dining area and the outdoor pool. Green is everywhere so you are really able to unwind from the city hustle. The Italian restaurant (Waterfall) is really top notch both in terms of kitchen and management. The pool is very big and also boasts a jacuzzi,4,September 2018,
Worth Every Penny!  No one else compares.,Mike C,"Flew from Houston to Singapore via Manchester and decided to book the executive room at the Shang-ri-La.  From the moment we arrived, they exceeded all our expectations.  We arrived at 9AM and they worked hard to find us a room.  We were escorted to the executive lounge and offered a wonderful breakfast.  Normally I’ve avoided this hotel as it is not in the middle of shopping. . .but what they lack in being a few more minutes away from Orchard Road is more than compensated by their quality of service.  To summarize; the best wines I’ve had in any lounge, excellent breakfast, great views from lounge, tasty healthy Hors d’oeuvres, good internet, large clean comfortable room.  You won’t want to leave the hotel!",5,June 2019,
Fantastic Stay in a beautiful hotel,DamienMunnelly15,Myself and my wife had a fantastic stay recently. From the moment we arrived we where greeted by the wonderful staff who catered for our every need. The hotel reception was absolutely beautiful and a real highlight. Our room was terrific and extremely well layed our. There a a great buffet breakfast that you could have every morning followed by a dip in the pool. The spa was another highlight.,5,June 2019,
Outstanding Hotel,FamTandL,"We stayed for four nights in the valley suites. All we can say is WoW! The rooms were simply beautiful, the staff were all amazing, polite, helpful and kind. The food was stunning, as were the pool and gym facilities. An oasis in a busy city, we will return.",5,June 2019,
Happy stay at the hotel,juan,"Wonderful service. The room, the food and the facilities were excelent. Specially Peter from the foyer was very helpful. We talked a lot about the statues of the lobby.

A Beautiful Evening!,Nans2504,"I attended my company's event and I must say it was an amazing experience. The staffs from every department were extra ordinary. Let me give a thumbs up to the Banquet Manager Daniel and followed by the lobby staffs Marcus, Aris and Samuel were very polite and helpful. They were so professional. Lastly concierge Sheesh and Arif were so friendly when I needed their help. Please say a big thank you to these staffs.",5,May 2019,
Wonderful Stay at Singapore Shangri-La Hotel,Blues_Rocker,"I had a great stay at the Singapore Shangri-La Hotel in June, 2019.  The check-in and check-out experience was outstanding...friendly, courteous, efficient and very helpful!  I really enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the Line each morning...great selection and the service was outstanding, as well.  I tried the dinner buffet at the Line and I was not disappointed...the Shangri-La chain has excellent reputation for its buffets and the Line is no exception.  This stay was a truly enjoyable one!  Thank you for a job well done!",5,June 2019,
Fabulous hotel,mrsgregg,"We have previously stayed at the Shangri-La in K.L and that was a fantastic experience, so when we knew we were coming to Singapore, there was no doubt where we were going to stay.  We arrived by taxi, and before we knew it, our cases had been removed from the boot, and were being taken into the hotel. We were met by a member of staff who then took us to the check in, took our names and then escorted us to the top floor to the Horizon club to wait while our check in procedure was completed. Hilary took very good care of us while visiting the Horizon club. Within minutes we were then shown to our room on the 22nd floor, with a fantastic view of the city. A welcoming box of tea was then delivered to our room. The staff are unbelievably so helpful, and courteous, going out of their…",5,June 2019,
Great Staycation,Happy,Friendly Staff. We had an enjoyable stay at the hotel and the  experience was great from check-in to check-out. Good food was served at the club lounge. We will definitely return to the hotel for another staycation.,5,June 2019,
Staying again at Shangri-La Singapore,Michael Z,"Very friendly people all over. Especially as I arrive and depart usually in the morning, I have always the same team at the concierge table. However, as I mentioned already, I am not so happy anymore with the breakfast at the Horizon Club. Before the renovation it really was a very high level of luxury with a buffet and a very distinguished service by the team. Now all has been changed to self service and it is not the same feeling of luxury anymore. I normally compare it with Shangri-La Kowloon and there is a difference.",5,June 2019,
Excellent Staycation,Edna S,"Fantastic weekend getaway at the Shangri-La. Thanks to Shawn Tan, from check--in to check out, we were taken care of with warmth and care. They even sent up a birthday cake which was totally unexpected. Spacious rooms, quiet, and beautiful gardens. This is possibly the best hotel to stay in if you want a restful time in busy Singapore.",5,June 2019,
Amazing family experience,Susan C,"We had such a lovely stay here with our 6-year old boy. We stayed on the family floor 9 which has kid themed rooms (we stayed in the junior suite that wasn’t themed). All the staff were incredibly friendly especially Peter from the lobby who made such a special effort to make us feel welcomed including giving our son the cutest squirrel. The pools were perfect, lovely food at the restaurants and everything was immaculately clean. The kids club was more suited to kids under 5. Our son got bored pretty quickly but that’s ok because he just wanted to swim all day long!!",5,June 2019,
"Good service, nice location ",travelloverstar,"Shangri-La has 3 buildings (tower wing, garden wing and valley wing), and we have stayed in Valley Wing this time, it has a separate entry, the mini bar in room is free (non alcohol beverages only) and the lounge bar provides free drinks and afternoon tea throughout the day. For breakfast, you can choose to have breakfast just downstairs with more privacy or to have buffet breakfast in the tower wing, which is just 2 mins walk, I personally think that the buffet breakfast has better choices. The location is good, which you can walk to the malls in Orchard road!",5,May 2019,
Amazing staycation,Benoit ... G,"Did i say Amazing?! From the room (spacious, clean), to the area (quiet, spacious), dedicated children area (playground, events -baking, story telling, music,...-, special outdoor pool), breakfast (very large spread), ... everything has us, clients in mind.

Awesome stay in a fabulous hotel,Peter,Terrific stay and a special thanks to Peter from for the foyer  for his exceptional hospitality and warm reception. The hotel is fortunate to have such a wonderful ambassador. Great food and location Looking forward to returning soon.,5,June 2019,
Always a great stay,Shaun T,Another great stay here over the weekend from start to finish which has become the expectation here. The welcome and the settling in is sublime with a comfy room. The only downside today was actually the breakfast organisation at the The Line restaurant today which was a mess. Prob needs a rethink when the place is busy.,4,June 2019,
Perfect Stay at the Shangrila,Catherine Ortigas,"Our family enjoyed our stay in Shangrila from the moment we checked in the lobby. We were greeted by Veren - gave a stuffed toy and cookies to my daughter, welcome drinks to the whole family. Veren even took our family picture in the Shangrila Lobby and had it printed and sent to our room in a Shangrila  frame and note. The next day, there was a delicious birthday cake when we got back to the hotel ( it was my birthday).Everything was beautiful and the customer service was superb. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices , even for kids. Before checking out ,my daughter wrote a note to Veren saying how much she loved the hotel. She told us she wants to spend her birthday there too! Thank you Shangrila!",5,June 2019,
Excellent Hotel!,justinjalanjalan,"Had a staycation in early April for my birthday. Informed them in advance that it was my birthday and they arranged for a complimentary cake for me. n. Got a free cake from Although it took sometime for it to arrive at our room without the candles. But it's OK and I appreciate the kind gesture. :)  The hotel facade looks dated but the rooms are actually refurbished and they look modern and sleek. The room is of decent size and can fit a baby cot nicely. Room service is impeccable and I love how they lay out the table for us.   I appreciate the service rendered and would highly recommend this hotel if you don't mind the location, which is some distance away from the train station and Orchard shopping belt.",5,April 2019,
Wonderful Stay!,dannyp2206,"We only stayed at the Shangri-La hotel for one night but our expectations were definitely exceeded. The hotel is absolutely beautiful- very ornate and tastefully decorated. Staff were so efficient and really helpful. As soon as we arrived we were made to feel welcome.  The rooms are very luxurious, spacious and clean. I really appreciated the extra sweet gestures like the pineapple tarts left with a thank you note in the room. Breakfast was amazing and plentiful, so much choice with a diverse range of dishes to suit every palate. Despite being a short stay, I would not hesitate recommending the Shangri- La hotel to others and I very much look forward to my next visit.",5,May 2019,
Was alright,Barfine R,"I arrived around 5am in the morning, there was no one to help me with my 2 bags. The girl at the front desk was helpful but kept saying HMMMM alot. Gym and facilities were very nice. Room was a little small for the price I paid. In breakfast someone kept following me around which was awkward. Service beside the pool was slow. Nothing so bad, was a nice stay i guess",4,June 2019,
More than a 5-star hotel,Denise,Excellent in every way & extremely friendly and helpful service. In particular peter from the foyer made our stay seamless and memorable.

Welcomed like family,Tom,"I travel to Singapore frequently for work and began staying at the Shangri La a year ago after trying many other places in the city.  I now consider the Shangri La first when making arrangements.  My experience has been very consistent, from the moment I arrive at check in to those early morning departures...brilliant.    The rooms are all well appointed and maintained and the very few times I've had a room need the hotel was immediate in their response, going well above to ensure I was taken care of.    The property is a refuge that I have come to appreciate more and more.  Being an easy stroll to Orchard but still on it's own, I find the relaxing environment perfect after long days working or touring the city.  Breakfast at The Line has always been superior, with early hours…",5,June 2019,

Disappointing second stay at a previous personal world favourite hotel,Jason W,"Beautiful property with tropical gardens, gorgeous scultpures, fountains. Check in was excellent and was given Garden Wing room overlooking pool with large balcony, BEAUTIFUL.  The pool is one of my all time favourites and in the early morning and sometimes in the late afternoon it was the perfect place to relax.  However, by mid-morning and throughout the day, miss behaved children made the experience less than pleasant. There were two large events going on at the property and it appeared at entitled children overtook the property, restaurants and facilities.  No supervision from the parents and no one from the hotel told the children to stop running up and down the lobby escalators or crash jump into the swimming pool near a relaxed floating adult.  Food was below average at…",4,May 2019,

Very pleasant stay in 5 star hotel,Stevie Septiany,"I arrived around 10am in the morning when the check in time is actually 3pm, but the staff found an available room so we can rest in our room right away. The staff in receptionist was very warm and friendly and explaining things very clear. The facilitation and room worth the price, my parents even praised how clean and sophisticated the room is. We 3 stayed at 1 room for 2 people with 2 single bed, at evening a cleaning lady came and asked if we need anything more because she knew 1 extra people staying so we asked extra towel and mineral water that she gave freely.

I have stayed in shangrila for over 20 years , the services deteriote and get worse, especially treating guest. They should treat guest politely and in profesionalism manner.  Secondly, i come with my family, we are having holiday so as we enter the lounge and sit at the table, the staff come over to inform to matter why we can't be qualified to enter.

Asian hospitality at its best,Freddes,"The original and first ever Shangri-La has has retained its charm, even if it is now a huge hotel with its 3 different wings. I would recommend the Garden wing, with its covered gardens and cascades, that has a bit of a more intimate feel than the rest of the hotel. The tropical gardens in the middle of the city are simply stunning and an oasis of peace and quiet. Some suites or rooms give you access to the Club that is located on the top floor of the main tower and that serves tea and pre-dinner cocktails with a lovely view over Singapore, night or day time. Service is attentive and perfect, and our garden suite was extremely comfortable with lot's of genuine asian charm as not ""modernised"" like some other parts of the hotel. I do hope that they will keep this style of…",5,April 2019,
Wonderful and pleasant stay!,Gennie Ng,"The hotel staffs were very helpful and friendly. Very prompt attention to the needs especially the front desk Reception Manager Wen Jie, he is helpful and patient with my queries, as well as Iris Chiu the guest relations officer, should give them credits for their assistance to me during the stay. There is also a chef at omelette cooking station named Jaya Raj and also a lady named Amond as well who were very prompt and attentive to my needs when dining in The Line Cafe during breakfast. All of them are very well trained I hope the hotel will have more of this staffs around. Very satisfactory stay, will definitely come back again to this hotel whenever I’m back again for visiting soon.",5,June 2019,
Fabulous family stay,Benjamin G,I’d start off by saying that this hotel is very well run. The management team and staff are polished and efficient. All our requests were managed very well and in good time.   We brought our baby boy along and the hotel provided a steriliser and bottle warmer upon request. The baby mattress and cot is nice and soft unlike many other hotels. We would seriously consider a family deluxe room at the tower wing the next time we stay as there is a shared baby pantry with all the essentials.,5,June 2019,
Very nice and sweet stay with shangri-la,Zhu,It is wonderful and sweet memory with shangri-la in Singapore. And it is my best stay in all of my shangri-la hotel.  Very nice people and smile here.

Best place to stay in Singapore,Marco V,"Shangri La understands how to make a visit a real experience.

Yet another amazing stay,H L,"We just completed another week-long stay at this incredible property! This is our number one address in Singapore for many years now and every time it feels like coming home, everyone greeting us with smiles from the moment the taxi pulls up all the way till we wave goodbye to Johnny, the concierge. This very personal touch sets this property apart from all other properties in the world. It goes without saying that the spacious rooms, impeccable room servicing, extensive facilities with lots of green space and a very nice breakfast leave nothing to be desired during the stay. Only the hotel-branded water in the normal rooms and the birds outside at breakfast do the property somewhat of a disservice, but this is nothing compared to the incredible staff this property employs.

Beautiful hotel but a bit off the beaten track (Orchard Rd.),Kahaluu_Bob,"This is a beautiful hotel, with well appointed and well maintained rooms. The hotel pool is large and lovely. The only disadvantage of this hotel is that it is a bit off the beaten track: it is a good 5 to 10 min. walk from Orchard Rd. and another 5 min. to the metro station. That doesn't sound far (it isn't) but it is hot! in Singapore. If you want to see any of the sights in Singapore other than the shopping on Orchard Rd., this hotel is a bit less convenient that some others. But if you want a quiet getaway in the city, this may be right for you. The Chili Crab in the Lobby Lounge was a delightful surprise! It was the best we found in Singapore (small, but delicious).",5,May 2019,

Their rooms are large and clean, with a good dose of luxury. The breakfast is very varied and superb, so is the other restaurants and food options in the hotel. One area that stand out, even amongst the high standard of this hotel, is the health club/gym. This area is very well run and super tidy and justy a pleasure to use! See you next year!",5,May 2019,

Great family vacation,trance530 .,"Stayed at the new themed suites. Castle theme with bunk bed and a separate caretakers room. Compact and great for the family.

In the evening, they drop an IQ letter into the letter box outside your room. It contains the answer to the code that opens a safe in the room. Safe has two very sweet toys for the children. A very nice touch.  We had access to their executive lounge on the top floor. Very private and beautiful. They even had toys and childrens snacks during the day.

A very special place,Ellen H,Little late with this review but we had another lovely stay early in the new year.  We have been staying at this hotel for many years now and although we have at times tried elsewhere there is something that just keeps us wanting to get back to the Shangri-La.   We had a beautiful suite in the Valley Wing which has been our wing of choice these last few years.  It is so comfortable and beautifully serene with the most  exquisite service.  Many of the staff in the VW have been there for years and they are all absolutely wonderful. A very special thank you to Nora and Aiesha who took such care of us.  We are so very grateful!

I’ve finally been to Shanghai-La!,PDMM_Gourmands,"Stayed here during the Shanghai-La Dialogue. The service, cleanliness and attention to detail is really second to none. My king suite was huge, well appointed with coffee maker, minibar, free wifi, toiletries and plenty of natural light! The evening room check is also very good as they offer more bottled water and fresh towels. The pool, restaurants and bars are also simply excellent, though pricey by North American standards. The beds and pillows are oh...so comfy. The breakfast is also very generous and has all types of world foods. I jiffy recommend this place for its superlative service and overall quality.

The (Sh)Angri-La Experience,salmanshaban,"To my surprise I was disappointment to see Shangri-La Hotel Singapore had many shortcomings specially in comparison to the Shangri-La in Middle East. The value for money was low and the comfort level was not as one would expect at Shangri-La Singapore. I was staying for 1 week at Horizon Club room. Our trail of problems began on day 2 when our bathroom started to leak water. The maintenance team promptly came to fix the issue and same time the guest relations team came to apologize as well. To our surprise, on day 2 the same issue happened and same time the AC stopped cooling which we later found it was linked to water leakage issue.

Having stayed here some 18 years ago I decided to show my new wife what pure luxury is all about.  We decide to visit for a few hours and find out what can be offered for next year.  Well!! what a surprise we had. We were greeted by 2 gentlemen and a lady, Annie, Mohamed Rani (Guest relations officer) and Peter from the lobby.  We experienced a welcome that I am sure is reserved for Presidents and Prime ministers. Whilst Mohamed secured some rates for us for next year, Peter took it upon himself to show us around the hotel and rooms.

The Meaning of Shangri-La?,Michael A,"Shangri la definition, an imaginary paradise on earth, especially a remote and exotic utopia. The staff and accommodations here most certainly strive to provide this experience for you. The city/state of Singapore is exotic to many for sure, and the Shangri-La Hotel helps define this great place. The service was exceptional, and being walked to my room by the person checking you in was a new experience, who then went over my accommodations with me.  I only ate breakfast at the hotel, but is was excellent, and the selections by culture were impressive to see, that wherever you were from they had you taken care of.  I stayed in the Valley Wing and the room was all that I could expect, which was top notch.  To go back to Singapore, this is where I would want to be, paradise......",5,May 2019,

Specifically, they even suggested me effective way of trip planning with the efficient way money spent. Thumbs up for their customers centricity mind set. Particularly we have two young kids along, this really helped. Also, in between my stay here, I got to go kulai, Malaysia. They help me to arrange for transport.

Disgusting,zoekay83,"I have tried to submit this review 5+ times and it never gets published.   This is our second stay at Shangri La Singapore. We weren’t overly impressed and had some minor issues the first time we were here but our son really enjoyed the pool and kids club so we decided to give it another shot. Today is our second day and we are so disappointed. Our Saturday checkout seems so far away and I’m afraid we are stuck here as we paid in full when we booked.   We made our reservation direct with the hotel a month ago over the phone and I put through some simple requests; a high chair for our son, the minibar to be emptied, that the coffee table in our room be removed (sharp corners & toddlers are not a good mix!), and a microwave.

Faridah from in-room dining was very attentive with my Iftar and Sahur request, making sure the food arrives on time and enough time for me to eat (given that Sahur is early in the morning).   Always look forward to visit Shangri-La again.",5,May 2019,
Great hospitality,Shivani,"I stayed at Shangrila for a few nights in May 2019 with my husband and 5 year old child. It’s a beautiful hotel, with facilities for children (kids club, designated family area at breakfast). Despite being busy it never felt over crowed. Hospitality has been excellent- speacial mention to Veren who was very helpful and made our stay very welcoming and warm. Ayyappa in the kitchen who made food to order at breakfast and always willing to accomodate. Not to forget Johnny at concierge who is full of extremely useful tips on navigating the city!  Overall a true 5 star with a personal touch.  And a few words from my 5 year old who loved the pool, the little green area which she thinks is the jungle. Definitely recommend this place",5,May 2019,
Great dinner service experience at Waterfall Ristorante Italiano,Andrew N,"Brought my young dinner dates (5 and 3 years old) for a pizza dinner within the hotel and came to know about the Italian restaurant in the hotel. Walked in and was greeted very friendly staff who helped to find the best available seats within the restaurant for me and my 2 kids.  Ordered a 4 cheese pizza, pumpkin soup, a carbonara penne and a glass of Malbec wine for the dad. The servings were slightly large and were perfect for sharing with my dinner dates. Bread and breadsticks were served before the meals to keep our mouths busy. Food quality was pretty good with the 4 cheese as the favorite dish across the table. Wait for the food was not too long despite the restaurant operating at about 50% capacity at the time.  Exceptional service from the staff which ensured that the…",5,May 2019,

Business trip with vacation worthy accommodations,Deb,"I arrived on Monday after a LONG 24 hour trip from the east coast US.  From the moment I stepped into the lobby, the service was outstanding.  From the welcome sparkling juice drink to the manager walking me to my room and providing an overview of the facilities, everything was first class.  My first floor room through the open air atrium was spacious with a private patio and garden.  The bedding and pillows we plush, the toiletries were extensive with toothbrush and paste, and comb in addition to the expected items.  The Nespresso coffee was most welcome along with complimentary water each day. The included buffet breakfast was AMAZING!  I had to do two laps before deciding what to eat each morning. The orchids and other tropical flowers are displayed throughout and are natural…",5,May 2019,
we were there to celebrate our 35th anniversary,roj,"the agent who checked us in was very friendly, this made a big difference, she offered us a late checkout which worked perfect because our flight to Paris was in the evening.  We enjoyed the lounge on the 24th floor, Anjan was amazing, she is very knowledgeable of Singapore, she give us lots of suggestions on what to see and do, this was very helpful because my husband was dealing with some health issues and  limited in some activity.  Jacky was very hospitable, overall your staff made our stay very enjoyable",5,May 2019,
Fun to be back At Shangri-La,LindaSudduth,"So lovely to be staying at this amazing hotel again. I stayed here many times while traveling in Asia for Levi Strauss & Co. As usual, the service and the staff here are spectacular! During my stay this time, I got a chance to chat with Peter from the lobby. He is very helpful and provides lots of good information. He treated us like old friends!!! We’ll definitely be back and we’ll look for Peter again!  😊👍🏻🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5,May 2019,

Amazing hotel!!!!,Ell,"We stayed in the Shangri la for 3 nights in May, we had the best stay and loved the hotel!! The hotel is beautiful and definitely 5*, the location is also great just a short 6-8 minute walk into orchard road. The staff are lovely and friendly and couldn't do more to help you with whatever you may need. We had bed & breakfast and the breakfast buffet was amazing!! Lots of choice for all different people, the food was also a high quality. We stayed in the king size deluxe tower wing room which was also lovely, with a delightful view of Singapore! Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone!!

"Shangri-La Hotel on Orange Grove, Singapore ",charlie721,We stayed for 10 days at this lovely hotel. We found the staff were excellent from the moment we stepped through the door. Reception staff were first class to set things off. Our Garden Wing room overlooking the pool on the 9th floor was superb and was maintained at the highest standard by the room team. Food was brilliant and room service was excellent also. There is a great team looking after your every need with such polite and friendly service. I would definitely recommend this hotel .,5,May 2019,
Family Staycation,Dawn,Such a fabulous place for young kids to enjoy - the pool and kids club are second to none.  The staff were also very friendly and sweet to the kids.  I will definitely be back to enjoy the Shang's hospitality again.,5,May 2019,
BEAUTIFUL HOTEL FOR PERFECT LOCATION,becky436,"We have just spent 5 days at this beautiful hotel,  2 of which were with a group and 3 as a couple.  While everything was lovely,  the rooms etc and the beautiful pool and gardens, the rooms were not cleaned very well during our stay. The food is exceptional, although very pricey! The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  Do yourself a favour though and before you book this hotel, find out whether there is a Conference being held there during your stay! 3 days of our 5 were busy with conferences and this spoilt the whole ambiance of the hotel! The beautiful foyer, restaurants etc were constantly crowded and very noisy with Conference attendees  - this spoilt our time there unfortunately. ",5,May 2019,
The perfect weekend getaway for a decadent birthday celebration!,Wonderlust8668,"We loved everything from the moment we set foot in the lobby. Check-in was smooth and easy and everyone was so friendly. It was my partner's birthday, and as a special treat, a birthday cake and chocolates were delivered to our room. We booked the Horizon Club Deluxe room and it had an incredible view. No balcony, but great views of the city! We enjoyed the canapes and drinks during evening cocktails in the lounge, and the breakfast buffet in the Horizon Club was excellent. Quiet space and attentive staff. The pool was fantastic. I was able to swim laps before the pool was overrun by others. Staff came through occasionally to serve small treats like frozen grapes on a stick and mango smoothie shots. Everyone was so attentive and friendly. The grounds are also immaculate. Kudos…",5,May 2019,
Honeymoon,raymurphy01,I have literally  just arrived at this beautiful hotel for my honeymoon. I would normally place a review after my stay but this time it is different. My foot was barely through the door when I was greeted by Mica the guest relations manager whom greeted myself and new wife as if we were family.  Immediately we felt welcome and felt like the only people in the hotel. Mica told ourselves all about the fabolous hotel and the facilities and anything we need to just ask. Mica upgraded our room for our special occasion and sent congratulations cake to the room. My new wife is over the moon and we feel like movie stars. I cannot wait to see what happens next.  Mica and her colleague Annie could not have been more helpful and we cannot wait to celebrate our honeymoon here in the…,5,May 2019,
Excellent Accommodation and Service,Jessel Mahase,"I had the pleasure to stay at the Shangri La hotel, Valley Wing and I can say that it is by far the best service that I have ever had in my life. The staff are always so friendly and outgoing and always, always willing to help. There is one person in particular with whom I felt a special, genuine type of interest to help, this was Mr. Krishnan, he was a doorman. When there were long, arduous days at the conference, the staff always made it better. Hats off to Mr. Krishnan, keep up the good work and service to mankind sir.",5,May 2019,

Stunning lobby,Adelaid94,"We've stayed at this beautiful hotel a few times now (Tower Wing). We always return due to the wonderful service in the Horizon Club.  The Club is very comfortable, welcoming and the food is of a high quality.  We stayed in the same rooms (interconnecting for our teenager children) again but really found them too small. It wasn't something we could overlook this time.  They also looked tired. The view was of a large concrete looking building. It was probably highlighted more this visit as we also stayed at another hotel near the marina which had magnificent views and also had much larger rooms.  Also, the hotel was more family focussed (younger children), with the introduction of a water park and also specific areas in the Horizon Club and main restaurant separated for kids.

Best Hotel in the World,KnightR,"This in my opinion is the best hotel in the world, the care and attention of the staff can’t be beat. We recently spent 4 nights here celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary coming back to this hotel where we became engaged. The setting and facilities are all out of this world and the hotel is close to everything you need. Without prompting the hotel laid on several surprises for us including moving our room. (See the photos) I would specially like to thank Cheong We Jie, the Reception Manager and his team especially Fatim. The two concierge’s we also amazing helping my wife find the right vintage jewellery stores. Finally, to the lady cooking the omelette’s who is up so early to make guests the best breakfast.

Outstanding,Eva T,The hotel is in the city but away from the main buzz. No shops or restaurants within walking distance but you won’t need it because the hotel has absolutely everything.  The room is so beautiful and comfortable with plenty of amenities and entertainment.  It is on the expensive scale but totally worth it.  Rooms are extremely quiet and bed is really comfortable.,5,May 2019,
Excellent Guest Service Officer,Jon C,"We stayed at the Shanghai-la Singapore recently. The Hotel was fantastic as normal, we have stayed many times. The reason for our review is to compliment Amir Ghazalo on his exceptional service during our stay. His professionalism was nothing other than sensational. Nothing was too much trouble for him and his friendly manner made him a pleasure to talk to. Thank you very much Amir for making our stay such a pleasure. All the other fantastic staff at the horizon club also deserve a mention for their great service as well. Kind regards Jim and Julia Moore ",5,May 2019,
Amazing-very family friendly,Safk,"We travelled here in April and we were on our wedding anniversary and we had flowers delivered to our room as well as fruits and a lovely cake.  We did a long trip around the middle east, Asia and then back to London. We were travelling with our 4 month old baby and this hotel was absolutely perfect for him. It was the best hotel for our entire stay in the different countries.   The moment you walk into the hotel people are so willing to help you. The staff gave our son a teddy bear which he loved. The staff at the front entrance were very helpful, especially Amin and Mohammed.   We were in the deluxe family rooms and it was fantastic.

Wonderful Hotel,Steve & Jen,This must be one of the best hotels in Singapore because it has everything you want in a good hotel. The Staff are friendly and attentive and there is a good choice of in house restaurants. We would recommend the old world charm of the Valley Wing for that special occasion. My wife and I went there for our joint 50th birthdays and the Staff went above and beyond to make the occasion special for us. There is also the more modern Tower Wing and the beautiful Garden Wing so there is a big choice of rooms.,5,April 2019,
You won’t find better !,Donna A,"Recently returned from a 3 night stay and wow what a amazing hotel ! I travelled here with my husband for a 50th birthday celebration trip and we were treated amazingly .. our room was upgraded to one in the Valley Wing and was outstanding , I received a beautiful bunch of flowers and card on my arrival. The Shangri-la best asset is it’s staff everyone is so customer focused and they  remember your name when you walk into the lobby and are the friendliest most helpful staff you could wish to meet.  After 3 nights we were moving to the Marina Bay Sands for a couple of nights and both of us wished we hadn’t bothered their service and staff are not a patch on what we encountered at the Shangri La. We have travelled to many top class hotels all over the world and we both agree that…",5,May 2019,
Amazing hotel!,Snazzy Pineapple,"This is a truly magnificent hotel, the staff are friendly and attentive and the amenities are first class.   Massive thanks to Fatina at reception who made the stay comfortable and welcoming - she was so lovely.   Little things like the reception remembering your name and staff at the omelet bar remembering your order added a personal VIP touch.   Massage at the Chi spa was a wonderful experience, as was afternoon tea at the Rose Veranda.  Only slight niggles were the pool closing time - 8pm. This should be extended as we missed out most night having come back late. It also felt like the pool was being closed around you at half 7 with staff running a cordon around you.  Also, you aren’t in charge of your balcony light (garden wing at least) as these automatically go off at 12am…",5,May 2019,

Quick stopover,thomaslee34,"Stayed at the Shangrila Singapore for one night on a stop over between Hong Kong and Sydney.  It is a home away from home.  From the moment you arrive, you feel welcome and looked after. Whether you want a simple meal to an extravagant fine dining, the choice is yours. Rooms are a little small but for Singapore standard, it's not bad.  Fully equiped with all essentials, all you have to do is ask if there is anything else you might have forgotten to bring with you from home.   Definitely book the Horizon Club as I always do.  Checking in and out is done at the Club where you can beat the rush and queue.  Breakfast and all day refreshments are also very handy and fulfilling. The location seems a little away from the main part of town but Singapore is so small anyway.  Plus, the…",5,May 2019,
Beautiful property. Excellent service.,Gail B,"We stayed one night pre- and post cruise. It was beautiful, both the hotel and the grounds. The service was excellent as well. The only thing that people might want to think about is that it is not in the heart of the city. It is more out of the way than many of the other hotels, but that is what we were looking for. If we were ever in Singapore again, I was stay here without a second thought!",5,April 2019,
Stunning hotel. Wonderful service. The perfect luxury experience.,Richard,"We stayed in the Valley Wing for our honeymoon and were absolutely blown away from start to finish.   The attention to detail and quality of everything was simply outstanding and the service was absolutely exemplary from beginning to end. We were literally treated like royalty from walking through the doors and the buildings interiors are breathtaking - you could easily mistake it for a palace.  Very special thanks to the wonderful staff, who really went above and beyond to spoil us and make our trip extra special.  100% highly recommended and we will be returning very soon.

Although we arrived very early, Quaraishia (and I apologise if the spelling is incorrect) at check in was extremely helpful and although we could not access our rooms immediately, she made sure we could access the Horizon Club for some breakfast as well as other parts of the Hotel.  The staff in the Horizon Club, particularly Melissa and Baoshin could not have been more helpful.  Indeed all the Club staff made our visit a particularly enjoyable one.  All the hotel facilities were of a very high standard.  Was it expensive?  - yes, but in this case you do get what you pay for.",5,April 2019,
Great personnel and premises,anitap007,"We spent 4 nights at this hotel and were very happy about it. We ended up spending more time at the hotel itself than we ever have before by hanging out at the pool, spa, Horizon Club... We were invited to a musical soirée as well, so the hotel offers many activities.  We also got engaged there and the personnel helped my fiancé to organize a total surprise for me. After engagement we even received the engagement photo in a frame into our hotel room - such a lovely surprise!  Very friendly and professional atmosphere created by the staff.  P.S. Warmly recommend taking the Horizon Club access as it was a cozy place with a gorgeous view to have a breakfast or afternoon tea.",5,May 2019,

End of a great cruise!!,Barry M,"We spent two nights in the Singapore Shangri-La Valley Wing - definitely a to-die-for room.  What comfortable surroundings, amenities and service!  Spectacular options for breakfast each morning and a great selection of restaurants to chose from the rest of the day.

Definitely will recommend this hotel to friends and will hopefully return someday.",5,April 2019,
What a Beautiful Hotel,Whatcom,"We only stayed two nights, but wished it could have been longer.  The Shangri-La sits in a quiet, green and nicely landscaped tropical oasis, just far enough from busy roads to make for a most relaxing stay.  Our room was beautifully appointed, with great attention to details, and everything was in working order.  We enjoyed the view of the pool and the lovely grounds. While admiring the three globes covered with live anthuriums in the lobby, we got to meet and chat with Peter, one of the lobby employees.  What a refined gentleman!  He wanted to make quite sure that everything at the Shangri-La was to our total satisfaction - and it was. We felt very pampered as guests of the Shangri-La Hotel and heartily recommend it.",5,April 2019,
"One night in this pleasant hotel, good service and excellent room",Simon S,"We stayed in a garden room overlooking the city. The core of the block has a nice garden and combined water feature. The room was as you'd expect for a top hotel. Orchard Road is easy walking distance from the hotel which was the main pull for us for our first night in Singapore. Singapore feels very safe at night; and night walks are good for jetlagged visitors from Europe!  There was quite a queue at reception on arrival but once we got to the front the pleasant and friendly staff checked you in and then showed you directly to your room.  The pool closes at 8pm and the pool staff make you very aware of this putting out poles and chains from 7pm onwards. The jacuzzi is good after a long flight.  Breakfast choice in the buffet was excellent, lots of different style foods…",5,April 2019,

Pleasant stay,Alan,"We have been staying at Shangri-La Singapore for a few times, and we love this hotel very much. Various restaurants offering nice food, and Shang Palace is definitely our favourite.

The last but not the least, spending time in the Horizon Club really bring us a remarkable experience.",5,May 2019,
Getting better overtime...,JERRY_0072,We stayed in a suite in the Garden Wing with our two kids. I have stayed several times at the Shangri La Singapore over the last 15 to 20 years.

The swimming pool and the gardens are quite unique. The service is fantastic.,5,May 2019,

Amazing experience!,Asha M,"We stayed 4 nights in the Family Suite at the Tower wing which had club access and it was such a wonderful experience. The room accommodated for my mum, husband and 5 month old baby. The hotel is stunning and the staff are beyond friendly and welcoming. We particularly enjoyed the Horizon club where we went for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks & canapés. The daily experience at the Horizon club was made extra special by the service given by Chef Ganesan Ashok who created mouth watering snacks and kept us entertained with his knowledge and expertise, we were very impressed by the standard and quality of the food which was served here.

Its one of my favorite hotels through my worldwide travel without a doubt!  What counts at the end is not only mere words but the action in tune with their marketing and promotions.  I also want to make a special reference to Siva the Bell Captain whose amiable nature  and surpassing my expectations has added to my joyful stay.",5,February 2019,
The Best 4 Days at Shagri La Singapore,Muzyk Kristy,"In the line of our business having a good break or a relaxing moment is a big gift for us.

A superb quality stay in Paradise,CathyGri,"We stayed 5 nights at the Valley Wing and only wish it could have been longer, but we will certainly return.  We have previously stayed here on 3 or 4 occasions and it is nice to note that they always do something that exceeds your expectations and also remember yoyr preferences from previous visits.  The room is spacious and very comfortable and is immaculately maintained by housekeeping who service the room twice daily.  The bathroon has twin basins, a good sized shower with a seat and handrails (ideal for older guests like us) and a bath with separate toilet area.

Fantastic restaurants : the Japanese has a beautiful location on the 24th floor with excellent panorama. The Italian restaurant (the Waterfall )  is like you are in Italy. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with all amenities you need!  Above all of this the management is environmental friendly: they ask you and only change the bed linens if you ask! I especially love this way of thinking because it is so unnecessary to change it day by day !",5,May 2019,
Far exceeded our expectations.,ganddhill,"This was our first visit to the hotel, although we have stayed at the shangri la at the shard in London, and wow from the minute we arrived at the valley wing we were transported back to the good old fashioned days when guest were treated as friends not meal tickets. The rooms are grand and colonial in style, the staff are so attentive and polite always showing the utmost respect at all times. We used the buffet breakfast the first morning as we were finding our feet but after that we used the summit room, which is just another class with silver cutlery,China teapots and service to die for. With being in the Valley wing you also get afternoon tea and evening canopes which are served as opposed to the horizon suite where you help yourself to a buffet style. All in all this hotel…",5,May 2019,
First holiday as a family of 3,Jazziechazzie,"We had a wonderful stay at the Shangri-La hotel, this is our second stay in as many years- and this time returning with our baby son. We were well cared for by all the staff and breakfast in the Valley wing was perfect.   We initially started the trip in the Garden Wing, however it did not meet the level of service that we had previously experienced at the Valley Wing.  In hindsight I guess the only thing that we feel is that the Valley wing suits us more than the others, so when we return we know where to book straight away- rather than trying anything new!",5,May 2019,

Supper,David,I got a business trip in Singapore and choose the Hotel for a short break. It was great time in there.  Service and staff were amazing.  The city view from the Hotel was great. We would like to share this recommendation for everyone coming to Singapore.,5,May 2019,
Great Service,JMY,"Having been a long-term Shangri-la customer for many years (over 20, in fact!), this was the first time that we stopped for lunch at the Lobby Lounge in Singapore. Although these days we can find good service in most hotel chains, it’s not often you come across a friendly face that becomes a memorable feature of our travels. On entering, we were greeted by a genuinely warm smile from Katherine. She took time to explain all of the dishes available if we selected the buffet spread, and to recommend some of the most popular options, including the Bak Chok Mee that we really enjoyed. We’re really happy that she took the time to deliver great service in what’s becoming a productivity driven world. Thanks Katherine! ",5,April 2019,
Nice Gardenized Hotel,sgken8,Tucked away at the end of Orchard Road is this old hotel which probably has seen better days. Still attractive and stayable albeit expensive. I think most visitors and clients are here for the nostalgia.,4,September 2018,
Trip to Shangrila,Missha123,"Fantastic service, rooms are impeccably clean. We had a great time and would definitely visit again. Buffet breakfast was a good selection of quality food. Only thing was it got quite busy in the morning and there was a long queue. The spa was one of the best I've been. Great atmosphere and the masseu was terrific. The kids loved the great info or playground and the fun arcade whereby the charges are very reasonable. Didn't get to try the karaoke. The kids also loved feeding the fishes and going on the sailboat. Snorkelling was ok.",5,June 2018,
Valley wing,Rhazade Gorriceta,Say hello to valley wing stuff. Hotel  touch of victorian era peace and quite  very private since it has his own entrance exclusive for valley wing guest.  Also booked the tower wing family themed suite. My daughter really loved all the facilities worth the priced you paid for. Definitely 5 star service. For sure we are coming back in our next trip to singapore.,5,April 2019,
Excellent hotel,Michele O,"Beautiful foyer to walk into and very welcoming staff. Check in was efficient and informative, thank you Josephine, and our room was lovely. Extremely comfortable beds with good linen, very well equipped bathroom with great bath, and an amazing view. Breakfast was amazing, every taste and nationality catered for. Enjoyed an afternoon at the pool, very helpful staff and a refreshing fruit smoothie handed to me after a lovely swim. Beautiful gardens and an orchard house. Enjoyed an authentic and tasty pizza at the Waterfall bar, thank you Paul for great and friendly service. We had a late checkout as we weren’t flying out until late and the staff were so helpful and accommodating with our room and luggage. We would certainly stay here again, a lovely peaceful stay in a busy city.",5,May 2019,
Relaxing Beautiful Hotel,Mbell1010,"Beautifully kept hotel in a very pretty area which is away from the busier areas. Located not far from the top of orchard road it’s about a ten minute walk down to the hi end shopping area, plenty of bars and restaurants reasonably close by.   It’s an expensive city so don’t expect the hotel to be cheap but to be honest unless you go to a hawker eating area nowhere is.  The rooms are beautifully kept as is the reception and the pool. The main restaurant is pretty good with plenty of options, seafood night is worth a visit if that’s your thing it was about £60 per head including soft drinks and bottled beer.  I would definitely stay again.",4,April 2019,
My Favorite Hotel in Singapore,JoeP2794,"Just an incredible Hotel, staff are super excellent and just for that alone its something to experience. The Hotel is located on a beach so you walk out of the hotel and you are on the beach. Great food too, the Breakfast Buffet is to die for delicious. Great rooms Ocean view a little more money than Hill view but both very well appointed. Superb Housekeeping staff.",5,April 2019,
Another excellent stay at Shangri-La,BGSchmidt,"For my recent business trips to Singapore, I have opted to stay at Shangri-La Hotel Singapore. I usually do stay in Shangri-La Hotels as I have mentioned in my other reviews, no matter which hotel I go to in the chain, I always feel very welcome and at home. From check-in to departure, everything is perfect and they always do try to make your stay just that much more comfortable. The receptionist so nice that she even remembers me when I run into her again.   This time, I have stayed in the Garden Wing Deluxe Room. The room is much more spacious  than the Tower Wing Deluxe Room. The deco of the Tower Wing is more contemporary and the Garden Wing has more character. It is also less busy as compared to the Tower Wing.   I have also visited the Origin Bar for a drink and their…",5,May 2019,
Shangri-La’s Exceptional Customer Service,Omar,The moment you walk into a Shangri-La hotel you will immediately realise the high standard of customer service that is experienced in all Shangri-La hotels. This hotel is no exception. Every aspect of you stay is meticulously catered for with extreme care. You will never regret the experience.,5,April 2019,
NOT ACCEPTABLE,nicolawca,"Stayed for only one Friday night.  Check-in was fast and efficient, the room was nice with all necessary amenities.  However, thats where the pros end.  The hotel was overrun by families with children that ran amok.  No chairs available both days around the pool.  Our first three choices for restaurants were full on friday night and again on saturday.  Ended up eating at the japanese restaurant on the 24th floor, which was very nice but, like others have said, overly expensive.     Did not experience a luxury 5 star stay.  probably will not repeat.",3,May 2019,
Fabulous visit,Explorer698695,"We enjoyed staying at the Shangri La Singapore very much.  Peter from the lobby waa extremely helpful and kind to us during our stay, which we appreciated very much.We enjoyed the facilities here and will come back here again We will also recommend friends to come here to stay. We will tell them to look for Peter.",5,May 2019,
City Break with a difference,Sean Pannell,"First time I’ve been to Singapore and one word summarises my trip, fantastic. Having flown in from London, the moment I arrived at this hotel my stay has been absolutely amazing. The check in process to my room was no more than 10 minutes, a complimentary drink on arrival, I couldn’t have received a more pleasant welcome.  All the staff are so friendly and helpful, the surroundings of the hotel are breathtaking, the food of which there is a huge range is all delicious. It is obvious the hotel aim at making your stay as pleasant and relaxing as possible, for this I wish to pass on my huge thanks to the entire staff, you are all highly professional. ",5,May 2019,
Magnificent hotel with incredible breakfast and gardens,Elga K,"We stayed one night before a cruise. It is about half an hour from the airport. Huge lovely bed, pillow not great, clean bathroom with bath. Coffee/ tea making in room with creamer. It took a while to work out the light switches. The breakfast was incredible with all kinds of food, hot and cold, especially Asian. The wait staff were very friendly and efficient. The gardens are extensive and beautiful with a lifeguard on duty at the pool.",5,March 2019,
Brilliant customer service,Emma B,"We have only been at the hotel a day and a half (we are still here for 1 more night) the staff couldn’t be more helpful we managed to check in early, we were allowed to use all the facilities included in our horizon club package (definitely worth having) and the concierge went above and beyond when we couldn’t book night safari tickets with our card and offered to use her own! We managed to use our own in the end. The hotel is beautiful and spotless, breakfast had so many options we didn’t know where to begin and if your happy to walk a little not too far away from the shops of orchard road. Perfect start to our holiday",5,May 2019,
Fantastic Club Level Experience,louie14,"Really enjoyed my stay at the club level for a personal holiday.  Atmosphere and personal touches in the lounge were among the top in the city.  Attentiveness of the staff was a highlight.  Chef Ashok stood out, quite perceptive of my dietary restrictions.  The room was quite comfy and housecleaning staff went out of the way to keep things neat.  Hospitality team was thorough and overall was a great experience.  I’ll be back for sure.  On the negative side for a personal holiday the pool was quite hectic and filled with families, hard to find space to swim, though I realize the hotel is geared for families so I was glad we had booked the club since no kids allowed after 6:30 PM :-).  Next time I come with my family, I’m sure my kids will love it here.  ",5,May 2019,
"Amazing Stay, First Class - only wish our stay was longer",Gill W,"We only stayed one night at the Shangri-La, and with hindsight, would have stayed there for the whole time we were in Singapore.    The hotel is absolutely first class.  From check-in to breakfast, you are treated like a VIP.   The location of the hotel is very good too for major tourist visits and the pool area is stunning.  I would love to stay here again, and to be honest, would stay at any Shangri-La hotels if the service and hotel were of a similar, first class, standard.",5,April 2019,

Amazing Stay,SuSu022001,"Our family of 4 stayed at this property for a week in April. I would highly recommend this property.  The beds are incredibly comfortable. The client service is impeccable.  Johnny at the concierge desk could not have been more helpful.  He booked tickets to Universal, Gardens by the Bay and other venues at a discount.  He made all of our dinner reservations ahead of our stay.  When we left, it was like leaving a friend!  The pool was a wonderful oasis to come back to after touring in the heat each day.  Matthew at the pool offered such great service, and I appreciated his warm and friendly demeanor. The location of the hotel was within walking distance to Orchard Road.  It was also short taxi rides to Little India, Chinatown and the Marina Bay area.  It was not too crowded and…",5,April 2019,

Best rest,kleinhanna,"Shangri La Hotel Orange Grove Singapore turns out the best hotel choice we’ve made in the recent past . A vast airy entrance makes peace descend on the weary jet lagged traveller .The staff seem to be a breath away from anticipation of ones every need with total expertise but no harassment Divided into three sections , a vast swimming pool in the U of the three buildings , on many acres of superalitivr planting each part serves different clientele We opted for a magnificent suite with balcony in the breathtaking Garden Wing Food of every description Vast breakfasts We could have stayed and stayed Thank you all at Shangri La Singapore",5,April 2019,
Superb Weekend Birthday Staycation,nixieee,"My husband and I had a memorable stay at Shangri-La Hotel over the Easter weekend.  Check-in was smooth where we were surprised with a room upgrade from Horizon Club Junior Suite to a Valley Wing Suite.  The upgraded suite was huge and elegant, with full supply of complimentary drinks and teas.  But the highlight was the birthday surprise prepared by the Horizon Club team! What a sweet gesture to welcome your guests with a birthday cake, chocolates, cookies, a basket of fruits and a birthday card.  We also had a full day access to the Horizon Club lounge for some afternoon tea and evening cocktails, as well as a full breakfast buffet spread at The Line.

Superb in every way,madamSouthAfrica,"My husband and I prefer boutique type hotels but the offering in Singapore is for rather large hotels. The Shangri-La is a massive hotel however caters for the discerning traveller with its different categories of rooms - garden view, valley wing and tower wing. We booked a junior suite in the tower wing with access to the Horizon Club Lounge.   JUNIOR SUITE The room was modern, tastefully decorated, spacious and squeaky clean. It comprised a walk in closet (with loads of cupboards and drawers), a small lounge with a fresh bowl of fruit, kitchenette (ideal if travelling with children) with a kettle and nespresso machine, a study table, main bedroom and a bathroom with a walk-in shower and separate bathtub and his and her basins.

Frontdesk staff shaved off the stars,Wanderjoie,"I would have given Shangrila Singapore 5 stars. The lobby was beautiful, check-in was seamless. We arrived as a group and were immediately offered welcome drinks and a place to sit while waiting. The room was likewise superb. I was attending a conference which would end at 12nn on our checkout date so my colleague and I requested for late checkout from Kaylee, the staff at the frontdesk during that time. She said that since we were part of a group, late checkout would be charged for the group. Since 4 members of our group were granted complimentary late checkout (Note: they were not Golden Circle members), we assumed we could request such, too. Kaylee was adamant and said we could not, so we left the conference early to checkout a few minutes before 12nn. Lo and behold, anothet…",2,April 2019,

BEAUTIFUL HOTEL,Mariaeugeniakunco,"We stayed at the Shangrila Hotel for 4 nights. The hotel is just beautiful. The personnel are so nice and helpful, they are always nice, and so eager to please. Since you enter the hotel, you know you've just hit it with the best hotel in Singapore. Rooms are clean, amenities are great, the view in the balconies is spectacular, a burst of colors, surrounded by so many beautiful flowers and foliage. Located very conveniently in a super nice place, it has a convenient shuttle that takes and returns you from and for the hotel to a lot of places. You'll not be disappointed if you choose this hotel.

Wonderful hotel for our Singapore stopover,Mark C,"A wonderfully calm and comfortable hotel with many Asian touches, away from the noise and bustle of Orchard Road but close enough to it to be in the centre of things.

Nice time here,temiville,"To be fair, it was a lovely experience eventually and close to the cable car station. However it’s old looking and not modern at all. I expected something different from Shangri-La something new fresh and modern. But it looks significantly old. Not bad, just old. The staff are very nice and we enjoyed it nonetheless.

Excellent Service - New Renovated Room,tntdubai,"This is a very old Shangri La property which has now undergone renovation and the room shown is one from the renovated floor.  The Standard Room are decent in size compared to other new hotels in Singapore, but not large enough for a couple with child to stay in the same room as there is very little space around.  The amenities are all ShangriLa standard and the quality of the Room Service is good with neat and clean sheets, bathroom and common area. Shangri La in Singapore have 2 wings and often the Guests get confused. The room reviewed is in the TOWER Wing. The rooms in Valley Wings and Garden Wings are larger.

Excellent hotel,Hans S,"What to tell about a hotel which offers excellent services in all details. From check-in there is so much hospitality, that you never will check-out.

Great Hotel and amenities but service needs to improve,lino,"Stay here for 2 nights. First location was near Town but not the closest, its around 15mins walk to town. But the place is huge and grand.

Service staff are always greets us with a smile yet giving us the privacy we need as guests.   Delicious breakfast and a wide range of different cuisines. Definitely one of the best we had ever had.

Good place for your little one!,Cheers_H85,Staff and room was fantastic! My son enjoys playing at the pool so much and he kept asking to go play there every day (we stayed for 3 days).

Nice resort very close to city center,ag88,Overall great stay. We ordered a hotel car to pick us up from the airport and after a long flight was pleased that they were there waiting it was super efficient. We booked a room in tower wing. Room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the pool. Hotel very family orientated so expect alot of screaming children  by the pool. The pool was packed every day we were there and sometimes difficult to get a lounger.  Breakfast was great with so many food stations and we were really spoilt for choices.  Checkout was a little strange. I to argue with the reception for him to allocate my shangri la points to my card. Because he kept saying the booking was made in my partner's name.

Amazing Rooms and Amenities,AFB,"We stayed here for 2 nights before heading to Bali - and the property is luxurious and well located.   We were in a Deluxe Room in the Tower Wing - the room was amazing, great amenities, loads of space and immense bathroom. It has everything you can expect from a 5-star hotel. We played with the curtains command way too much.  The only aspect that didn't empress me much and I thought was not very well taken care of is the pool area - it felt like a condominial pool, not very intimate and cosy.  Overall it was a positive experience but the pool area should maybe get a bit more attention.",4,November 2018,

Best of all we loved the Horizon Lounge for a relaxing and delicious breakfast whilst admiring the views, cocktails in the evening and an afternoon tea. The lounge experience was certainly enhanced by the staff, who frankly were all excellent ....Amir deserves to be commended for his handling of children, as well as Baoling and Anand;  apologies for not remembering all the names including the bar men who made superb cocktails!",5,April 2019,
Unforgettable experience,noraza y,Stayed 4 nights on 9th floor with family pantry and lifts that took us direct to Bud and pool. The halal meat source glued us to the hotel for daily dining. Room is fantastic with comfort both pillow and bed. Nespresso machine & fridge is a pleasant surprise. Lobby lounge local buffet bfast is fantastic. Staffs service is very good from porter to manager on duty and thanks to the in room dining team - fast service and tasty food. Travelled with my autism child and the team prepared for early check in and attentive to make our stay memorable instead of challenging. Thank you so much and we really enjoyed our stay. A perfect stay.,5,April 2019,
A great place to stay,groovy_couple,"Our experiences at the Shangri[la Hotel were excellent from the beginning to end.  We had a Horizon Club booking and were shown up to the Horizon Lounge on the top floor for a personal check-in service.  The room was clean, comfortable and spacious with great views over the city.  The staff were friendly and helpful at all times and were always eager to please.  Any time we return to Singapore we would definitely stay here. The hotel is conveniently situated about 10 minutes walk from Orchard Road with its great shopping opportunities and the Hop-on Hop-off bus stop.",5,February 2019,
Luxury hotel feel and very friendly staffs!,Kangwei,"I was just dropping in to this hotel on my way, to enquire on their Buds Easter Event coming up. Was warmly greeted by their staff Annie (whom I noticed her name on her badges) as I entered thru the main entrance at the lobby. Told her I was just looking around and wanted to find out about their Buds (for my kid). She was very nice and helpful to point me the way and took time to explain about their event and their beautiful decorations set up at their main lobby. I liked the service I received, every staff I noticed would have a nice smile on their face and greet the people. Would certainly return for a staycation next time with my family (and let my kid play at Buds of course)!",5,April 2019,
Top class!,Your Travel Buddy SG,"One of the best hotel you can find in Singapore with a very old brand name.

Excellent service,EJ93,"I couldn’t fault this hotel - it lived up to expectations. From arrival, staff were welcoming with a quick check in / walk to the room and tour of hotel. The hotel is modern and accommodates for all - lovely pool, huge breakfast buffet, massive kids zone and soft play area, spa etc. Walking distance from Orchard Road, and 15 mins away from the main city area. I would definitely stay again! ",5,March 2019,
Excellent customer service,Deb494,"We had a recent short stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. From the moment our car pulled up outside until we left, we could not fault the service from all members of staff with whom we had contact.  Our room was well appointed, spotlessly clean and comfortable. The only problem we had is that our stay was far too short!!",5,April 2019,
Best service I had!,Meirav M,"The hotel is super kids friendly, they were always nice to us, try to help in any way we needed. The kids playroom was amazing!!! The kid bed in the room was so cute like a tent, which made my son very excited to sleep in.   Rajin in the concierge was the best guy in the hotel, he helped me so much!! Super nice person and very very helpful!   I highly recommend the hotel for families, the swimming pool is not very exciting , but was good enough for us. The Italian restaurant next to the swimming pool was amazing!  ",5,April 2019,
A good stay.,TAfan00,"The hotel is sprawling in the midst of a compact Singapore. The location is excellent, close to many cool shopping areas and restaurants. The lobby, the grounds and the common areas are beautiful. The kid's club is awesome. Parents of young children would be thrilled to drop off their kiddos there for a few hours so they could have some relaxing time by the pool. We upgraded to a Club room and got a decent size room. The room amenities are very good, e.g. quality bedding, big and fluffy towels, quality toiletries, full size hair dryer etc. Now on to the ""not so good"".  The Club Lounge buffet is not as sumptuous and does not have a good variety of food as some of the Club lounges in Asia that we've been to, especially in Vietnam. The breakfast in the ground floor restaurant was…",4,April 2019,
Amazing,Chrisimon,"Great location near Orchard Road, nice pool area and tropical garden. Very nice selection of different breakfast options, Asian, European, fresh fruits, noodle soup prepared your style etc. Even with your have booked a club room I advise to have breakfast down by the pool instead of at the club level, where there is a much more restricted selection. ",5,April 2019,
Service with a smile,Tarun G,What can I say - magic from the moment we arrived until we left - suite was superb and our 17 month old loved the space and slept well in her cot - family check in area is a fantastic idea - same for family area in the lounge with high chairs. Could do with a few more items for children on the menu perhaps like pasta? - the pool was divine and our daughter enjoyed so much - all the staff were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely come back.   Highly recommended,5,March 2019,
Tropical paradise,Alexandra4466,"Staying here was a wonderful experience.

From the check in at the Valley Wing tower to the meals and the room, every single step was impeccable making us including my son totally welcoming!   Our room was the deluxe room and even with an additional bed, it’s still very very spacious! They also have toddlers size bathrobes and kids toiletries! I love them! So thoughtful!   The main season of coming to Shangri-La was also the amazing BUDs indoor & outdoor play area for kids! My son loves the space  and I love how clean and friendly all the staff were. My kid loves them.

Thank you to all the incredible staff.",5,April 2019,
What a wonderful experience,SG42,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in their Themed Family Room (we got the castle room). It was spacious - there were 2 adults and 2 kids - and the hotel is able to also accommodate a helper with a rollaway. The butler service was excellent - thank you Eden for the warm welcome and kindness. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was a dream! The family room included complimentary use of the pantry which allowed for laundry to be easily done. The kids had a wonderful time at Buds playground - easily the best in Singapore! While the rooms may seem pricey, you definitely get great value and I would stay here again! ",5,April 2019,
"Staff are very well trained, attentive to customer's requests, able to anticipate changing needs from customers.",teebh2016,Room was very well kept and cleaned twice daily.

The service levels and rooms generally are of the high standard you would expect from the chain.,4,February 2019,
Awesome Place to Stay,tripleJ,Stayed here after 7 days in Hong Kong and it was luxury compared the hotel in Hong Kong. The manager Jimmy couldn't do enough for us and welcomed us like life long friends.  The breakfast buffet was almost as big as the buffets we had in Las Vegas a few years back. They even had a gluten free and vegan section which was great for me and my daughter.  It is in a good location close to MRT. We stayed in the served apartments which also gave us access to the hotel amenities.,5,April 2019,
My 2nd favourite hotel in the world disappointed me this time. The first one is Le meridian Dubai marina,Ammara A,This time when I came back I had really high hopes of the same warm welcome that we had during new year and I was hoping that my love for meridian will be taken over by Shangri-La as I love Shangri-La Manila as well where I actually live these days. So upon going in to the room the kids amenities were not their and I had asked for it after the next day because I thought maybe they have forgotten which wasn’t the case last time. Today is my last day here so from check in till now no one ever comes to my room for evening service even if they do they don’t put anything. The same green apple and the oldest and smallest mandarin that was in our room when we arrived was till there and still is staring at me. I even checked that if I have the privacy on or not but that didn’t matter.…,3,April 2019,
Hotel experience of a lifetime,Elaineobd,We stayed in this most amazing hotel after a three week motorhome holiday through the top of Australia. It was without a doubt a class of its own. The moment we arrived we were greeted by the concierge who escorted us through the breathtaking foyer up to the Horizon club. There we were invited to drinks and snacks after our flight while they checked us in. From the room which we were allocated to the facilities which were associated with it all was flawless.The breakfast in the main hall was without a doubt the most inclusive ever with samples of delicacies from all around the world. The breakfast in the Horizon club was equally satisfying with just a little less variety. One must experience the main breakfast area at least once in your life. The beverages were also served in…,5,April 2019,
Wowed My Family.....,LuxeFamilyFun,"We visited the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore for one night after a recent cruise with our family of five.  We wished we had more time to spend at this property because it just oozes luxury and professionalism.  To be more exact, we stayed four nights at the Ritz Carlton Millenia in Singapore prior to the cruise - as we have stayed there in the past.  It's hard to not be impressed with the Harbor Views and the iconic image of the Marina Sands Hotel from the Ritz.    But other than amazing views, the Shangri-La was utterly perfect.  The level of service from the moment you arrive on the property - we stayed in the Valley Wing, which is almost a property unto itself.  The ""club level"" is essentially the lounge in the main lobby, with a variety of drinks (our favorite was the ""gins…",5,April 2019,
Wish we could give more than 5 stars!,Bishopburt,"We stayed in the Valley Wing for one night at the end of a six week trip to New Zealand and Australia. What a way to end our holiday! We were picked up at the airport and taken by a very friendly driver to the door of the Valley Wing, greeted by extremely courteous doormen dressed in traditional dress and our cases were whisked away to our room whilst we checked in and were given glasses of Veuve Cliquot and a gorgeous orchid.  Our room was really huge with a sitting area, large bathroom with separate shower, fluffy towels and bathrobes, small and large slippers and an amazingly comfy massive bed.

Pure Honeymooning luxury,Rachel R,"This is the most amazing and luxurious hotel we have ever had the privilege to stay at. As the first stop on our Honeymoon tour of South East Asia, this set the bar impossibly high! On arrival, just walking into the lobby we were taken aback by the opulence! It really is quite breath taking! We stayed in a room on the 9th floor of the Tower Wing, and although this did not seem like the most romantic or luxurious of the many wings available, we were still blown away! The room itself was a good size, and we were provided with a complementary bottle of wine, chocolates, a chocolate mousse cake and fruit, with a card congratulating us on our wedding. Very classy and a lovely touch! We were incredibly jet lagged on arrival due to the long flights from Birmingham to Dubai then…",5,November 2018,

Truly top hotel,flyingw0lf,"From location (half way between Orchard Rd and the Botanical Garden), to Reception, rooms, amenities, a top place in Singapore! We had a conference, all was superbly organized. Dinner in the Chinese Restaurant was deliciously superb. Only remark, since many people (as I) walked the 5-10 minutes to Orchard Rd, and 15 min to the Botanical Garden, the access from Orange Grove Rd to the hotel is totally ""pedestrian-unfriendly"". I tried on several occasions both entry and exit driveway, and got almost run over by fast accessing or leaving cars, without a pedestrian sideway. This should be retrofitted to make the hotel perfect!",5,March 2019,
"The Lobby Lounge at Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore",Emily Pua,"The Lobby Lounge at the Shangri-La Hotel, Orchard has been featuring Singapore local dishes in its semi-buffet lineup. There’s a live Popiah and Kueh Pie Tee station, and a spread of Nonya Kueh and Pulut Hitam. In addition to the buffet, you can choose one out of the seven iconic hawker dishes as the main dish. we enjoyed the chilli crab and beef rendang. The ambient is relaxing and the service is great.

Fantastic,SybilVimes,"We stayed in The Valley wing and would highly recommend it. All the staff were excellent and very helpful.

"Excellent location, good experience ",Ahmad A,"A close ride from Orchard Street, an excellent location. Rooms are good and well maintained. Staff overall are good except I had a not-so-pleasant experience with one of the front desk staff. We had five rooms and I needed to have a late check out for one of the rooms and she would not budge! I had to talk to a different front desk staff to sort this out.  The pool is really nice, a 40m one, so it is very good for the morning swim. I would stay there again if I come back to Singapore. ",4,March 2019,

Outstanding Tower Wing and Horizon Club!,,I had an absolute amazing time at Shangri La Hotel Singapore!  A gf and I stayed in the newly renovated tower wing with horizon club access.

There are plenty of sofas and tables in a well lit and bright space with plenty of food selection.  During tea time there were so many different canapés and assorted cold meats.

Great place for downtime in Singapore,neil c,After visiting with friends and seeing the sights in Singapore we had 4 down days at the Shangri-La and it was exactly what we needed.  We had a Garden Room with a balcony that overlooked the pool which was great.  The overall service in the hotel was amazing. There are a number of different restaurant options so something for everyone.  The breakfast in the morning is especially good.  Pool is perfect for the 30 degree plus temperatures although finding a lounge chair on the weekend can be hard later in the day.

Quiet sanctuary after business meetings,GAPChicago_IL,Throughly enjoyed my visit at a wonderful hotel. The entire staff was outstanding and looked after me as it was my first trip to Singapore.

Peter at check-in arranged for a discounted amount to extend my stay into the evening as my Emirates flight to Dubai was very late.

Nice size rooms and bathroom   Hotel food and drink expensive, but so is most of Singapore.   Free postcards in the room which are also posted for free which was a nice bonus.   The staff also gifted our baby girl a soft toy which was lovely.   Pool area always very busy and hard to find free sunbeds although I think many were empty or saved.

Still deeply impressed,U D,"I travel to Singapore regularly for more than 30 years, and for me it has been the Shangri La from the very beginning.  Still quite young at that time, I started with the Main Wing, added the Horizon Club later on, changed to Garden Wing a couple of times, and ended up in paradise for many years now: the Valley Wing. Everything about this really exceptional highest level hotel has been descibed here before very good. I don't want to name particular staff members, as all of them make me feel like a friend without taking my privacy. They really manage to make me feel like they are just there wating for me just in case I should need anything  Weeks before I travel to the SL I'm looking forward to my early morning swim in the beautiful pool and, even more, to the exceptional…",5,March 2019,
Fantastic hotel and staff,Echina,"First stay at this Shangri-La. Amazing service, special thanks to Peter From The Lobby! Staff provided attentive, intuitive service, anticipating our needs with children, such as setting up a sofa bed and provided kids amenities without asking. The room was lovely (Horizon Junior Suite) as was pool and kids club. Food was delicious and we felt warmly welcomed and taken care of our entire stay (thanks again Peter!). We will definitely be back and highly recommend.",5,March 2019,
An excellent holiday,John T,We recently had a City day stay in the Valley Wing and felt that we must share our opinion of the superb hotel and service provided. We have stopped in many first class hotels but this was definitely up there with the best. The only minor criticism that we would make intended in a positive way was that there was a lack of parasols for guests. Thank you to all the staff whose service was outstanding we would definitely go back.,5,February 2019,
A Modern Day Beyul.,Michelle J,"So can you really describe a location of a hotel chain as a Beyul a blessed refuge.. Yes.  On the first of November 11,000 Kilometres from home and with all my support mechanisms fast asleep I needed a refuge somewhere to gather myself having been refused boarding for a flight (incorrectly for which I have received full compensation).  All I could think of was to return to the Shangri La.   One of the Guest Relations Officers Iris Chiu Ning approached me and instead of being baffled, unclear of how to react to an unscheduled return offered instinctive care and attention and began co ordinating a response.  Less than 24 hours later I left armed with the appropriate emergency paperwork and met my schedule cruise departure in Myanmar. It is many months ago now and I returned to the…",5,March 2019,
High tea in lobby lounge,MUHAMMAD MOIN UDDIN,"For my wife’s birthday we went to the lobby lounge in Shangri-La. they serve one of the best  high tea in Singapore. It was quite enough for 2 people. Selection of tea and coffee are excellent. Our server COLLEEN was awesome, she took care of us perfectly and arranged a small cake with candle to celebrate the birthday. Thanks ",5,March 2019,
It is too bad that hotel ratings cannot go higher than 5 stars!,Steven L,"There are many hotels in Singapore, aspiring to meet the high-end expectations of travelers to this extraordinary city.  Surely, the Hotel Shangri-La Singapore is at the top of the high-end list.  It is certainly one of the largest 5 star properties in Singapore, with 3 distinct towers to accommodate even the most discriminating of guests.  We were assigned to a well-appointed one bedroom suite in the main tower, which had two bathrooms, and almost every amenity that one might need.  We were greeted with first class service at every turn. We had access to the Horizon Club, which enhanced our stay in so many ways. The Horizon Club features snacks and beverages most of the day.  A cocktail service is offered at 5 PM every day, and it is part of the Club access.  The attendants in…",5,March 2019,
Excellent Staff,jplas69,"We quite often stop at Singapore for a few days on our way to Australia and when we do we always stay at Raffles but, unfortunately they are still in the process of an overhaul and were not taking any bookings at the time so, we decided to stay at the Shangri-La and upgrade to a suite. The hotel is obviously vastly different to Raffles and cannot begin to be compared to it as that would be unfair so I will just review this based on it as a stand alone hotel. It is very modern and clean, the suite we stayed in (garden suite) was nice but not as big as some suites we have stayed in during our travels (Emirates palace, Abu Dhabi for example) but it was well laid out and the flower covered balconies are a nice touch. When we stayed it was Chinese New Year so was fairly busy but the…",4,February 2019,

Sometimes you do get what you pay for.,Roy W,"Stayed in the Valley Wing for a few days en route to New Zealand. We couldn’t fault it in any way. The room was lovely, complementary high tea, and then canapés with champagne or G&T or cocktails superb. Breakfasts also excellent. But above all it was the staff who made our stay so memorable, with attention to detail, unfailing cheerfulness and service ethos. Possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed in. If you can, stay in the Valley Wing for those extra treats!",5,March 2019,

Amazing hotel,fajar248,"Stayed for two night at Shangri La Singapore, I think this is one of the best hotel in Singapore. Location was nice, near from Orchard road, they provide shuttle bus to orchard area start from 10 am, every hour. And to CBD area every 7.30am. Hotel staff super friendly, fast check in check out process. We stay at garden wing pool view, room was good, clean bathroom, nice bed, and view to greenery and swimming pool area was perfect. We had lunch and breakfast at two different restaurant, and all service and the foods is good, wide selection of food available, fresh juice, fresh coffee, they also have teh tarik. If you traveling with little young kids, go to buds kids zone (entrance fee around SGD 30/person), definitely they will happy play at in and out door play ground. Overall,…",5,March 2019,

Excellent hotel and service,PaulW,"I always ask myself if I would stay at a hotel again? With the Shang Ri La not only would I stay there again I would travel just to stay there! The level of service and genuine friendliness of all the staff is excellent and they are credit to the hotel and Singapore. We stayed in the Horizon wing and had access to the lounge there , which is worth the cost . Thank you to all the staff at the Shang Ri La and particularly at the Horizon lounge . ",5,March 2019,
Absolutely top notch!,Liz,"We stayed for three nights in this hotel, part business, part pleasure.  We’d book a club deluxe room but were upgraded to a junior suite which was delightful and spotless. Booking a club room is definitely worth the extra; the three hour cocktails is the most generous I have come across and the snacks were delicious.  I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is a definite favourite.  Staff are all lovely, room service so quick(!) and the room was always well stocked by the attentive service people.  Oh and the chef prepared the best eggs we’ve ever had.  Well done!",5,March 2019,
A real touch of luxury,MonicaOr,"This hotel is everything you would expect from a 5 star resort. On arrival at the hotel as the taxi pulled up you are greeted by a doorman in national costume who has your bags out of the taxi before you have even got out. On check in you are greeted with a refreshing chilled glass of fruit juice. The rooms are spacious and well laid out with everything you need from drinks, snacks, wardrobe space, plug sockets through to bathrobes and slippers.  The swimming pool and gardens are a delight and their Orchid garden is a must see. As well as a spa and gym they also have facilities for children. I love the daily workshops they put on for the children to make cakes with the chefs, a great idea.  There is a free shuttle bus that runs daily to the main shopping area of Orchard Road…",5,February 2019,
The hotel of Presidents!,Ronald Payne,"Stayed one night at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore in Junior Suite #1016 which included the deluxe services in the Horizon Club on the 24th floor. This six star hotel has all the services that are fit for a President, as Trump stayed somewhere on the property in 2017. Our oversized Jr. Suite had a tub and separate shower, king bed, super fast included WiFi, large flat screen TV, large walk-in closet and the first class services of the Shangri-La.   Because we were in a Jr. Suite the check-in was conducted in the Horizon Club and we immediately knew the quality of the hotel. Enjoyed the complimentary afternoon high tea from 2pm to 4pm and the cocktails and canapés from 5pm to 8pm in the Horizon Club. An excellent breakfast was included in the Line Restaurant or the Horizon…",5,March 2019,
Superb stay,Stuart G,"I have just returned from a wonderful 7 nights stay at the Singapore Shangri La Hotel. The Hotel was booked with British Airways as part of a package and the accommodation was in a Tower Wing deluxe bedroom with Queen sized bed and included the breakfast buffet. The room was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean, with a bed I would have been happy to have at home, unlike many hotel beds it had no squeaks and sags! It was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in bar none.  ( a few years ago I stayed at the Shangri La in Sydney which to me was overpriced, tired and at best average, but the Singapore Hotel is in a different league altogether). The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful and a credit to the Hotel. It was my birthday while staying at the Hotel and the…",5,February 2019,

The service there was special and we thank Ivor and the team for making our stay special. The pool and garden area is a delight, when you think that you are the middle of a very large city, it is an oasis.

Top Notch Singapore Hotel,Stokeexile,"I’m fortunate to have stayed in several five star Singapore hotels on work trips and Shangri La was my most enjoyable stay yet. It is very luxuriously appointed with every service you could need, and it also has great play and pool facilities for families with young children. The club floor facilities are well worth the extra cost and I thought better value than other hotel club/executive floors in the area. The location is an easy walk to the top end Orchard shops and MRT but the lobby is also well served for taxis, you never have to wait long. This is a business hotel but also a family hotel. The service staff are great, friendly and professional without being stuffy. This is what set the hotel apart for me- in Singapore hotels, posh sometimes means stuffy. The atmosphere here…",5,February 2019,
Valley Wing Shangri La an oasis of 5 Star luxury!,Shona C,We arrived at the Shangri La in Singapore to be whisked by a lovely member of staff from the stunning contemporary check in desk in the Tower Wing to the classic luxurious Valley Wing. We were staying in Singapore at the end of a trip to celebrate our Mothers 85th Birthday and the welcome we received in the Valley Wing was second to none by Carloite and Iris. We were offered champagne afternoon tea at check in - what an amazing start to our stay! The Valley Wing offers guests a range of wonderful inclusions in their stay and you really do feel extremely well taken care of. The rooms are very luxurious and the lobby lounge is stunning with chandeliers and very comfortable seating ideal at the end of a busy day sight seeing.

Brunch at the Line,vijaya e,"I’ve always loved the buffet at The Line & after an absence of a couple of years we decided to have brunch there today. It certainly lived up to all our expectations.  Yes, the price of Sunday lunch is a bit steep but the quality & range of food provided is well worth it!  We indulged in the fresh sashimi, cold lobster, laksa & the Indian cuisine. All of these were beautifully prepared, generous & delicious. In fact when the cold lobster & satay ran out, our very attentive & helpful section manager, Omar, kindly got us more. A small criticism was that the chilli crayfish was over cooked & looked grey - not very appealing compared to all the other food on display.   Despite being full with all our savory dishes, we still managed to squeeze in some delectable desserts. We were…",5,February 2019,
I wish it was CLOSER!,JimKX,"Think this was my 4th or 5th stay, i never look for any other hotel in SG as Shangri La just works for me so well, simply beautiful.

Although i travel and stay on business at this hotel i would have no hesitation in staying as a family here as it is child friendly. Very Well done and thank you everyone once again - PERFECT",5,February 2019,
wonderful experience,rebem,"Great start with the meet and transfer service from the airport. After a long flight, lovely to be greeted and welcomed. The driver rang ahead to say we were almost at the hotel, and so was taken straight to my room by the Receptionist. I enjoyed swimming in the pool, using the shuttle to the transit at Orchard road, the coffee and bakery items from the little shop in the lobby, and 2 very nice room service meals. I wasn't quite as impressed by breakfast as I anticipated - thought the choice of fruits might have been wider - but that is being picky. Another positive experience that will encourage me to stay in a Shangi La hotel again.",5,January 2019,

Stop over to Australia,Michael F,Really nice hotel beautifully done. Staff were great and really looked after you. The breakfast was fantastic too with a massive selection of foods from around the world. This hotel is great for the shopping areas of the city however is really only accessible by taxis. It is a little out of the way and Singapore is not very accessible if you have a pram. We walked a lot as we had our 16 month old daughter and didn’t want to carry the car seat. In the end we had to carry car seat and taxi around as it is so hot and difficult on the public transport. The pool area is great and the gardens very well kept. The room was big and offered a great bathroom and facilities as you would expect.,4,February 2019,

They are happy to assist with anything & everything. And if you want Pho in the morning, say hello to Esker (?) at the noodle/pho station.

A solid 4 star experience,sujatojo,"Was excited about the prospect of staying at the Shangri-La but was pretty underwhelmed by what, although a solid 4 stars, did not match the 5 star experience I was expecting. I am sure they do have 5 star rooms but ours in a tower wing deluxe room was definitely 4 star. Clean and nothing wrong with it just lacking that little something extra.  The location is a bit out of the way of everything but they do have a free shuttle bus which takes you in the general direction of Orchard Road. Breakfast at the Line restaurant was great with a massive choice including everything you could think of pretty much, however the decor is very ""UK motorway cafe"" which lets it down.",4,November 2018,

Disappointed follow-up,John W,"I reviewed the Shangri la several days ago shortly after we had arrived. I mentioned iin that review the volume of children but this increased sharply during the week with enormous package tours arriving from China. The hotel became a giant childrens' playground with no boundaries. The pool area became a football pitch and although the pool itself was divided the children and their parents totally ignored this. It was hard to move around because of all the selfies being taken and there was no peace from the noise of children playing and mobile phone calls (for some reason with the phone held about 12 inches from the face to encourage shouting).

This is a ""must stay"" if you are in Singapore!",5,February 2019,
An amazing hotel,Scott29inSeattle,This hotel gets 5 stars hands down.  I am usually very critical of the high end hotels because they don’t deliver.  The Shangri-La in Singapore does everything right.  The staff go out of their way to help and are well trained.  Rooms are quiet.  Room service is excellent. The pool is amazing.  Hotel location is just far enough away to be outside the chaos of the city but yet an easy taxi ride to anywhere.  This hotel has been my home away from home and I will stay here again.,5,February 2019,
Beautiful Hotel,Peggy A,"The hotel is beautiful inside and out.  Walking distance to shopping and restaurants.  The lounge on top had an incredible view.  Like a lot of Singapore the prices are quite high, a glass of wine or drink is at least $22.  The rooms are technologically advanced with touch lighting that is actually a bit of a hassle to get used to.  The electronic shades were a nice touch and the balcony was outstanding with the view of the city.  An outstanding hotel but a price tag to go with it.",4,November 2018,
Very Good,Guiotto,We have stayed here several times before but this is our first since the refurbishment. The refurbishment is excellent and the usual high standard of service was evident once again Thank you. We stayed during Chinese New Year so the hotel was extremely busy. Were were in the Horizon Club in the Tower Wing and it is a lot more family orientated since the refurbishment with the result that there was a lot more children. We were two adults travelling alone. It was wonderful to see the families having such fun. If you want a less lively stay surrounded by less children then I suggest you stay in the Valley Wing. We have stayed there before and will revert to it when we are back later in the year. A great hotel and one that consistently provides a warm welcome and a high standard of…,5,February 2019,
Grand Looking,CK Chong,"This hotel within walking to the Orchard Road, is very grand and great. The food is amazing and the restaurant and breakfast has many variety. When I did the room service, they even offered to do me a custom made dish that I fancy. Overall the business convention area is great.",5,December 2018,
Exceptional stay and service!!,JTraveling 123,"My family has been staying at the Shangri-La for many years. It consistently never fails to meet expectations, delivering exceptional service and superb rooms. Our experience is always heightened by Cory Ann Wright, who delivers personalised and warm service. She is one of the reasons we keep coming back to the hotel. Furthermore, every member of staff (particularly around the pool and at the Line) is exceptional and makes you feel right at home. I have no hesitation in recommending the Shangri-La Singapore.",5,February 2019,
"Unremarkable hotel, out of the way for shopping and attractions",Arthur H,"Not in the Marina Bay area or within walking distance of Orchard Road shopping, though remodeled, this vast 850 or so  room hotel would not have been my first choice, having stayed at several other hotels and clubs on prior visits to Singapore.  We were booked for a one night pre-cruise stay included in our cruise fare. Our room in the tower wing had the king bed at a peculiar angle to accommodate a not too large room with a not to large bathroom, both of which appear to have been recently remodeled.  The view from this seventh floor room of a roof top was not particularly inviting.  Breakfast was equally unremarkable in a vast and unattractive buffet restaurant.  I don't know what the cruise line paid, but I would feel cheated if I were paying at the rack rate.",3,January 2019,
Superb,langford4,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in.  Staff professionalism, courtesy, charm and efficiency are a major factor; also the excellent, large pool and gardens.  Our room was a good size and extremely well equipped and comfortable.    Origin Bar provided wonderful and strong cocktails ; the in house Chinese restaurant was excellent too.    This is not the cheapest place to stay but is worth every local dollar.  Strongly recommended.    ",5,January 2019,
Repeat visit,Marion N,"We stayed here three years ago in the extra luxury of the Valley Wing, this time we were in the Tower Wing which was also excellent.  The location is quiet, although a little far out from the main attractions but public transport is good.  The grounds are lovely for relaxing in and there is a nice pool too.  The breakfast restaurant is very busy but we were given the alternative of using the Italian restaurant one morning, which has less choice was much more quiet.",5,January 2019,
The best hotel for family and business I have ever experienced,TallSuzy,"I travel a LOT for work and this time, because I was going to be traveling for 3 weeks, I took my family with me. This hotel is SO thoughtful. We stayed 1 week on an Executive Floor in the Tower wing. Rooms were small but everything was well laid out and everything worked so well. Enough power points, with multi-charger outlets and USB ports. The lighting works really well with subtle night lighting so that small children aren't afraid at night but it's low level enough that the adults aren't kept awake by it. There are thoughtful tables and chairs for when I needed to work. Then, the second week (we went somewhere else and came back), we stayed on one of the family floors. This is just amazing. The rooms are larger and have full-sized fridges. The bathrooms don't have bathtubs…",5,January 2019,
Most amazing experience.,Shahreen K,"My husband & I stayed for 5 nights on our honeymoon. We booked the king room with Horizon club access. From check in to check out the service was the best I have come across yet. Food, staff, atmosphere and professionalism was second to none. It really is the small things that count, we were very well looked after. Location is great and the hotel is exquisite. Would definitely recommend. ",5,January 2019,
Waterfall restaurant,Stan Kim,"Food was excellent. Service was even better. Tonny, Dinesh and Jodie were very sincere when providing an amazing experience. Their service and focus on ensuring that the kids were also well cared for allowed us as adults to enjoy our dinner. The Chef was very kind to recommend all the foods that were allergy free for my Son and took special care to Ensure that he had a number of items to choose from. Will definitely be back!  ",5,February 2019,
Valley wing was fantastic,luxurytraveller7411,"During my trip of 5 top Singapore hotels, the valley wing has to be near the top.  Emphasis has to be placed on the VALLEY WING, as I understand the garden and tower wings are not to the same standard.  Valley wing has excellent food, breakfast at the summit room, interior decor, and individual welcome. Friendliness and efficiency by the staff is unbeaten.  Special thanks to Dominique at the summit room for adding that special touch. Excellent.  If it’s good enough for Trump, it’s good enough for us.",5,January 2019,
Shangi-La,Angus70866,"The room was superb in every way, the breakfast was Excellent. They staff welcoming, friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic,and  professionalism.The Shangi-La Singapore set a high standard, near to get around. ",5,January 2019,
A lovely Shangri-La Hotel with fantastic service,Lyndallaussie,"We arrived from our flight at 7.30am to be picked up by the Shangri-La hotel car, a lovely and relaxing way to go. On arrival we were met by the Club Lounge staff member and taken to our room - it was ready, which we were most grateful for!! thank you. All the checking in was done in our room and our suitcases arrived immediately. Our room was lovely and spacious and had a wonderful view over the local area.   We went and had breakfast in the Horizon Club which was extensive and delicious, with a chef cooking omelettes to order and plenty of other dishes to choose from - Western and Chinese.   It is Chinese New Year and the hotel was decorated extensively and looked very pretty. It is situated in a lovely quiet residential area of Singapore not far from Orchard Road. The Hotel…",5,January 2019,
There’s litterally Nothing bad about this hotel!,Nanna A,"We love Shangri-La and this newly refurbished property was absolutely wonderful!   We stayed in a one bedroom suite in the tower wing on the 22nd floor, and the room was amazing!  The shower pressure was awesome, and the bed was very firm and comfy. We also loved the idea of the coffee table being able to convert into a bigger and higher dining table to enjoy an in-room dining or a home made meal from the kitchennette.  There’s lot’s of storage room for clothes and luggage and the rooms are very sound proof.  For readers who have more questions, feel free to send me a private message.  A hotel is like a home away from home and it is important that you feel welcome, which the staff here all made a wonderful job - You can tell the staff really love their working environment…",5,January 2019,
Breakfast Time!,Steve W,"Lovely hotel, back of town, close to main shopping district. All reviews fair. But now.... breakfast time.... breakfast is busy, this hotel crosses across business and holiday makers. Breakfast for many travellers is not included, but mine was. You enter to a reception desk where they take your room number and then via earpieces escort you to a table. You sit down (I am a lone traveller). Drink? Yes tea please and I get my tea, I then proceed to obtain my breakfast via the buffet that has the lot, all lovely, staff attentive. I return to my table some 5 mins later to find 2 people sitting at it..... I then walk back to the reception breakfast plate stacked in hand to state someone is at the table, there are no others I can see free, they apologise 1 million times and commence to…",4,January 2019,
5 star experience,Wilyfox68,"I stayed here for a work conference. From a personal perspective the rooms were clean and very well appointed (Tower Wing), bed was genuinely comfortable which isn't always the case in hotels. Food was excellent (though only had breakfast and working lunch) and the health club facilities as good as you get in most hotels. The staff, regardless of their role, were polite and extremely helpful. From the business perspective we were also very well looked after. Close to Dempsey St if you want to get outside and while a little further from the main CBD etc with the taxi prices everywhere is within reach.",5,January 2019,
It Depends on the Wing!,Mydaycations,"I have missed to experienced the Valley wing, which most reviews coming from there. We stayed at the Tower Wing. Please note there are 2 Shangrila in Singapore, 1 in Orchard and 1 in Sentosa. In Orchard Street there is 3 buildings namely , Tower Wing, Valley Wing and other wing.  Tower Wing is the main hotel where the grand reception welcomes you. I believe this is the Family wing as you have a mini Kidzania at lower ground. The pool shared by 3 wings are beautiful but service does not justify the luxury feel of the pioneering Shangri-La.  The main restaurant is huge with lots of varieties, The Spa and gym in this wing is worn out. If your with a team, you do not get to access other floor level. Your access is where your room only. The Doorman was courageous. The Concierge not…",4,January 2019,
Valley Wing Luxury,Cath Marwood,"Our family stayed in the Valley Wing to celebrate my 50th, my brother's 40th and Mum's 70th - what a great way to celebrate in luxury.  We all received a complimentary chocolate cake, bottle of wine and balloons in our rooms on arrival. The attention to detail was fantastic. Each evening we enjoyed complimentary champagne, wine and spirits while listening to the beautiful harp player in the lounge. The rooms are spacious with lovely products in the bathroom.  The hotel facilities are beautiful, a very large spacious gym, clean pool area with comfy deck chairs and the high tea served in the garden was delicious.  Wish we could have stayed longer!",5,January 2019,
Awesome service,hdelalla,I arrived from India to Singapore on a red eye flight at 7:30am. I got to the ShangriLa before 8:00am. Grace checked me in and was very accommodating in letting me have access to my room after I told her I did not get any sleep in the plane! What awesome service! Thank you Grace!,5,January 2019,
"Wonderful place to work, stay and relax ",bcmfairley,My first time to Singapore and the Shangri-La hotel was a great place to stay and have business meetings.  Staff is outstanding.  Service is great.  The Horizon lounge staff ensured everything was perfect throughout my whole stay.  I will definitely be back!,5,January 2019,
Unparalleled service in fabulous Valley Wing,Jan8134,Our second visit to the Valley Wing left us vowing to return. The level of service and friendliness of staff is really exceptional. Deluxe room was gorgeous. It’s a haven of peace and tranquility and we relaxed immediately on registering. Breakfast delicious as is the array of snacks and canapés offered throughout the day. Delicious wine and Champagne.,5,January 2019,
Delectable spread and top-notch service,anitmatt,"The buffet spread was simply over the top. By over the top I mean the different types of food offered to diners, international and local. My favourite was the chilli crab (very meaty) with the sweet sauce and fried bun; grilled lamb chops and prawns; fresh seafood i.e. prawns, mussels, clams, crabs; roasted prime beef, slow-baked fish; veeeeeery rich and flavourful seafood porridge and condiments. Friedly managers, Hatim and Gobi made sure we had a good dining experience. The staffs were very attentive and efficient in clearing the used plates and replacing our cutleries.",5,January 2019,
Great dining experience,Mern W,"This is my 1st time to the The Line @ Shangri-La, Singapore. The fabulous spread of international varieties of food is simply impressive. The food quality is top notch and all taste so authentically delicious.  The F&B teams are equally professional in their service deliverables. They were attentive to our request for change of table too. Thank you.",5,January 2019,
Rose veranda,Peh YL,"I had the afternoon high tea at rose veranda to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was a wonderful experience. When i arrive at the lobby looking lost, the lobby staff Ms Hong Wee approach me and direct me to the restaurant with a warm greeting. Ms Mel at rose veranda was very attentive to our needs, always making sure our table was clean. The dessert is fantastic and we had a great time here.",5,January 2019,
Top Notch,Greg E,"Stayed here for a week before our Christmas cruise. This is an excellent hotel with fantastic service staff....Johnny in the Concierge and Ivan Poon in the front desk were amazing and a credit to the hotel. They were both super helpful and you can see they really enjoy making your stay the best it can be. The surroundings were very nice; we had two rooms in the Garden wing with view of the pool which I would recommend. Even though the room was a bit dated, it was still big and comfortable. The buffet breakfast was probably the best buffet we have been to with so many different food stations.... it was well worth it. The Italian restaurant onsite was also very good. Location is a very short walk to Orchard drive with lots of bars, shopping and MRT. Would highly recommend this…",5,December 2018,
Average service for price,Maxxx,"This is my 6th visit to Singapore and first/last time staying with Shangri-La. I feel there are properties that offer better service for same or less price.  The Positive:  —The property is very large with a nice pool, large rooms and large balcony.  —Housekeeping service was excellent!  —Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful  The Negative:  —Breakfast buffet is very large with variety and as such, it is very average in quality.   We arrived as part of a family (12 adults) vacation package and we all had average service.   —Upon check-in, room requests (queen beds v. Twin beds) incorrectly allocated. I was given escort to my tower, others in my group were not.   —There was confusion at check out, our entire group was to be given complimentary 4pm checkout as part of our…",3,January 2019,
We loved this hotel!,Carrie T,"We stayed here twice in August last year on the way from the UK to Australia and again on the return journey, each time for 2 nights. We travelled with our 2 children, aged 11 and 9 and we all loved it, we all still talk about it. We had a room upgrade on our first stay, we had booked two interconnecting rooms and were upgraded to the 9th floor to the family floor where we had a family suite. Our room led through to a safari themed children's room which would sleep 3 children. There was one canopy bed, made to look like a safari tent with a pull out trundle underneath and another bed that pulled down from the wall. There were safari murals on the wall and you could also enter the room through a tiny cupboard door in the main bedroom (a special entrance just for children!). It…",5,August 2018,
Still a gem but needs a polish to really shine,Dinktrekkers,"We stayed at Shangri-La Valley Wing for 5 nights.  As return guests of the Valley Wing, we are well accustomed to the impeccable service of the staff and our experience on this occasion was no different.  Nicole was fantastic at check in and servers Carlito and Khair were friendly and attentive.  A facial and massage at Chi The Spa is a relaxing way to spend an hour or two.  The spa facilities and treatment rooms are clean and comfortable.  The staff are so friendly and welcoming.  Although the Valley Wing has been a favourite of ours when visiting Singapore, we note the following observations from our recent visit.  • The breakfast menu (in the Summit room) could be improved by offering a broader selection of food on the buffet, although the hot food options are good and cooked…",5,January 2019,
One of the best!,William M,"The minute you are greeted by the staff outside (quite the uniforms) and escorted inside by other completely professional staffers you know you are in good hands.  Efficient check in ,  beautifully appointed room with all amenities, fantastic pool and grounds- what else: close proximity to Orchard street shopping...easy walk.",5,January 2019,
Fantastic stay,Sarah C,"The hotel is stunning and has so much to offer for couples and families! The gym was especially good!  My partner and I were lucky enough to have one of the club rooms where we could access the Horizon club, highly recommend that if you can afford it, the canapé and drinks period fro. 5-8pm was fantastic and especially great if you love nice wine as Alcohol is so expensive in Singapore!",5,January 2019,
You’re simply the best!,Ralf M,"Arriving for a two days stop over, playing golf in Singapore, but unfortunately I’m not a pro taking part in the HSBC Open at Sentosa, so chose this hotel and played other courses. The hotel is just outstanding, or like a taxi driver told: 6-Star!

Had a great time and will come back here!",5,January 2019,

Family stay in the Treetop Family Suite,Grant C,"We just had a fantastic two night stay in the Treetop family themed suite. The room was amazing. The kids loved the cubby house to sleep in, as well as the hidden bed in the wall. They also loved the secret doorway between the two rooms. They had their own bathroom with a nice bath. We had our our en-suite - it was nice not to have to share with the kids!  Our bed was massive! And very comfy. We loved the big fridge, the bay window with booth seating and the access to a washing machine and dryer. The kids enjoyed Buds (kids club) and went every day, sometimes twice. We also loved the treasure hunt around the hotel, the kids welcome gifts on arrival and the regular access to fresh fruit on our floor and in our room. We could either have breakfast in the Horizon Club or in The…",5,January 2019,
Exactly what you'd expect from a Shangri-La,Jager350,"Definitely one of my favourite brands and the original hotel that started the chain did not disappoint.  The entrance and lobby is very grand.  We had booked a Horizon Club room so went to the 24th floor to check in.  Our room was a bit small but newly renovated as was the rest of the Tower Wing.  We very much enjoyed the Horizon Club Lounge - maybe too much.  Due to its convenience and comfort, we weren't motivated to endure the heat and explore the hawker stands as originally planned.  In fact, we were even advised by friends to try the hawker food in the lobby lounge as it was curated by local hawkers.  Staff were always available, friendly and courteous to all of our needs.  The only complaint - and this is a personal preference thing - is that the mattress was a bit too…",5,January 2019,
Absolute excellence in every respect,Hetty B,"The foyer was bedecked with stunning Christmas decorations, the room was superb in every way, the breakfast first-class. But what really stood out was the warmth of the staff whatever their role. Each was so welcoming, friendly, helpful and genuinely enthusiastic,  whilst still displaying total professionalism. They showed pride in providing exceptional customer service to one and all. The Shangi-La Singapore set a high standard - one which totally eclipsed their hapless 'sibling' hotel in Kowloon, which was woefully inadequate across several measures.",5,December 2018,

Simply Perfect,Yi Z,"By far one of the best hotels we’ve stayed in, booked a deluxe family room for 6 nights before last Christmas, travelling with two toddlers are never easy, however the hotel is beyond excellent in every possible aspect. From arranging connecting rooms to allocating dedicated family dining area, from providing amenities and toys for the little one to helping with transport and logistics during our stay. We had buffet breakfast at The Line restaurant which served a rich selection of beautifully cooked food choices around the world, service was fast, attentive and personal.

Superb Experience!,Ankit_Wadhwa,"The team at Shangri-La knows how to keep up to the reputation of the brand they work for & the team just did that when we went to Singapore for our Annual Meet for Top Performers. We reached early morning & instead of staying back with the group for sight seeing, we took a cab & reached the hotel 4 hours before our expected arrival. The team took care even then & extended us all the help to get us a room much before with the help of our travel team. The service at the hotel is simply superb & quick, the staff is ever courteous, the food prepared for our event was lip smacking. The rooms are spacious with a beautiful view & is just 5-7 minutes away from Orchard Road. ",5,October 2018,
Superior Stay in Singapore,Stacey K,"We were beyond pleasantly surprised with our incredible room and stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore.  It was definitely one of the best city hotels we have ever stayed at.  A+ accommodations in the newly-renovated Tower Wing, outstanding service from Andreas Chan (Guest Services Officer) and his team at The Horizon Club (located on the 24th Floor and has breakfast afternoon tea, and happy hour each day for those rooms who are granted access – very private and a really nice added touch to our stay), one of the best kids clubs (called Buds) that my kids have ever played at, 5 fabulous restaurants (the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Italian (a 10!) .

The best hotel ever?,Keith J,"We flew in for 2 days in Singapore and our travel agents had booked us into the Valley wing of the Shangri-la hotel. This was probably the best hotel experience we have ever had! World class room, world class service and world class ambience. The best observation I can make is that it was like staying in your own home with an infinite number of attentive, friendly staff to make your life perfect. Breakfast is brilliant with excellent chefs but sipping champagne in the lobby has already become a byword for luxury for us. We shall return.",5,January 2019,
5-Star Shang Hospitality,Dynamyque,"My family and I stayed at the Tower Wing of the Shangri-La Singapore in early January. We booked the Horizon Club Junior Suite which featured a King size bed, kitchenette, large convertible sofa (which turned into a bed for my daughter), executive desk and dressing area. In short, lots of space. One of the enticing features of this suite is that it comes with full access to the Horizon Club for check-in/check-out, breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail which runs till 8pm. The spread of food and drinks in the Club is extensive where quality and quantity dominate. From the moment we entered the hotel and led to the Horizon Club for check-in, we were treated to the Shang’s exuberance of warm hospitality, efficiency and courtesy. Unfortunately it cannot be said about the staff in…",5,January 2019,
Absolutely loved this hotel!,Isobella,"The Valley Wing is quiet and beautiful, staff were fab and the free 'British' tea and drinks was really nice. The rooms were quite old fashioned but they had a nice cozy feel to them. The pool is really nice and my two daughters loved how they gave you fruit by the pool. We also particularly loved all our cab drivers they were all so nice and recommend Ps Cafe restaurant the food is great. The hotel is very near Orchard Road (10 minute walk). Wish our stay was longer!",5,August 2018,
Return stay,Martin F,Good hotel in well developed gardens just off Orchard Road. Has excellent amenities and good sized rooms. I stayed in the garden wing which has a balcony overlooking the city. Hotel slightly let down by failure to allow late check outs without payment of day use charge and a breakfast that tries and does cater for every option but where quality comes second.,4,January 2019,
The perfect place for the start of our honeymoon,Hannah S,"We just wanted to say a huge thank you to the staff at Shangri-La for making our honeymoon so memorable.

Excellent Service at The Line,MelvinHJK,"Decided to have a family dinner to kick start 2019, and decided to revisit The Line again. The spread was excellent but what stood out the most during the dinner was one of their chefs running the pasta station. His name is Bryan. Greeted with a warm smile and remained calm and confident even though the orders are piling up when I visited the station. He gladly took my order and it was executed perfectly. Always a pleasure to see such young talent out there, servicing this industry. It takes passion and drive to motivate ourself to be standing on your feet for 10 hours a day. Keep up the good work Bryan.",5,January 2019,
Extremely Family Friendly Fun,Yallingupkk,"I was extremely happy with this hotel which has undergone recent improvements.  This includes its Buds Club for children, a full on indoor play zone with super convenient coffee shop and outdoor play zone.  My boys loved it and spent so many hours there. Plus the beautiful outdoor pool area.   The only downside was we believed the downstairs buffet was overpriced, and on arrival of our first night we experienced very bad service there - not typical of such a beautiful hotel... we therefore avoided that restaurant for the rest of our stay.  I would be happy to return to this hotel in future trips.",5,January 2019,
Lovely stay at this very child friendly hotel!,Stephanie,"My husband, myself and our 1 year old stayed in a Junior Suite in the Tower Wing with access to the Horizon Club on the 25th-26th November 2018. The room was lovely and spacious with all the amenities as well as being quiet. The Horizon Club which was renovated fairly recently is big with a seperate area for children where there are toys that they can play with. My toddler had a great time playing there as well as playing with other kids he met there. Staff were attentive, in particular the guy (sorry don't know his name but think he was Malay?) that was working on the afternoon/evening of the 25th Nov, he was very friendly and we really appreciated him chatting to us especially after we had a run-in with an unpleasant man that told us our child shouldn't be playing in the…",5,November 2018,
One of the best hotels I have stayed at,Ashwani C,The chef preparing bread at the Tandoor - Shakil is phenomenal with his smile and service as well.

Rest and Relax by the pool,dxbjamn,Week long holiday with a large family group. We were all well catered from. The kids spent loads of time in the lagoon and pool while the adults stayed beside the pool! Poolside service was very slow (>45mins) which seemed to be from a lack of organisation than anything else.  Staff were all friendly and very helpful. Which is to a large extent driven by the leaders they have. On a number of occasions we saw the f&b director bussing tables to help out the staff. It was great to see.  If we went back we would spend a few days on Sentosa then go to the shangrila on Orchard Rd to be more in the center. Though it’s only a $15or less cab ride to most parts of town.,5,December 2018,
Garden wing,Polim,It was a delightful getaway with our child for her advanced birthday celebration. A small top up to the room in garden wing came with a balcony with wider room space. The kids club makes Shangri-La hotel a great choice for anyone travelling with children because of the extensive range of fun and activities available to keep them occupied.,5,January 2019,
Exceptional Hotel with superb customer service!!!,indraka,We were on a short vacation in Singapore and stayed at this wonderful hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 9.00 am and although check in was at 3.00 pm the hotel immediately offered us a room until our room was ready. Grace who ushered us to the horizon club for complimentary breakfast as soon as we arrived was exceptional in her customer service - attending to anything we needed. A special mention to Chef Jaya who went out of his way to cook a special breakfast for our daughter when we slept in one day and missed breakfast. Well done Shangri-La - we will be back!,5,January 2019,
2 Nights Stay,Roadmartin,"We had a short visit in Shangrila-Singapore. Rooms are neat, bathroom facilities are big. I love the interior design of the lobby. We went there last December and breakfast is full and we have to wait for Queue, nebertherlessF&B staff are efficient. I would like to commend the healthy corner selection of the breakfast buffet, they also have Vegan corner. As we all know people try to be more healthy this time and Selection of Breakfast Healthy Corner is a very good initiative and not all 5 Star hotel has this more selection than Shangri-La offer. Overall good stay.",5,December 2018,
Amazing,Mira Bid,"The hotel is centrally located, very big but you don’t feel the crowds. We stayed here over New Years. The rooms are really nice, bathrooms a decent size. The kids club is amazing. Breakfast variety is really good. The staff are very friendly. As we stayed during the festive season the staff were a bit overwhelmed so service during meal times was a bit slack. I would definitely stay here again ",5,January 2019,
SINGAPORE = SHANGRI-LA HOTEL = PERFECT,donnewton,"If you plan on visiting Singapore, the Shangri-La hotel is the perfect choice. When selecting a hotel, it is advisable to take all factors into consideration.  First, the location of the hotel is short distance from the noise and sounds of the bustling city. Still it is close enough to walk or take a short taxi ride.  The hotel offers many amenities to numerous to list in this review.  The rooms are spacious and the bed very comfortable. Dinning in the hotel is excellent and peaceful.  Their swimming pool is massive allowing you to enjoy and relax from a long day.  Breakfast is excellent in two locations one on the lower floor and the other in the Horizon club.  Speaking of the Horizon club, I highly recommend you select that option.  Especially, if you are visiting the hotel on…",5,December 2018,
Stopover in Singapore,Elizabeth C,We stayed at the Shangri La Singapore 🇸🇬 as a pre-boarding cruise stopover.   We are family of 4 adults. It is a spectacular hotel with every facility and very welcoming and accommodating staff. We all loved it. Top marks!!,5,December 2018,
A fabulous stop off on the way home,Thomas Noblett,"I cannot praise, the facilities of the staff at this Premier Shangri-La, and the first hotel built by the company,. After travelling for three weeks, this was a fabulous destination to take off the dusty boots, sit back, relax and watch the world go by. Even though they had just finished a hectic festive Christmas and New Year period, there was no sign of strains on the smiley faces of the wonderful team members. I am a big believer it is the leaders and management of a hotel, that keeps the place ticking, and certainly this is no different,. Under the watchful eye and guidance of the general manager Bipan, The organisation is run with  Professionalism and  proficiency and the genuine warmth of the staff, and smiling faces, show you that the staff are happy with in the work…",5,January 2019,
Superb stay,balloonexpert,"Revisited Singapore after 20 year hiatus, having lived there in the Nineties. We stayed in the Garden Wing. Lovely rooms, food and staff. Good location although a bit of a walk to Orchard Road, however the shuttle bus is very useful. The pool is wonderful - large and uncrowded in November. Breakfast expensive but you've got to do it at least once for the sheer breadth of choice! The best part for me was when I came down with flu during our stay - a member of staff called Jessie came every morning to bring me hot water, lemon and honey! She arrived with a big smile on her face because she knew it would help me to feel cared for and happier. I don't think anyone else asked her to do this - I felt wretched and she made me feel much much better.  So thank you Jessie, I really…",5,November 2018,
New Year's Eve Holiday,harrylewer,"We recently stayed here over the New Year's Eve period for a 5 night stay and could not have been happier!  Check in with Grace was a breeze and we were able to sit down and enjoy some food and drink in the Horizon Club whilst she organised everything for us. Our room was very nice with panoramic views of the city. Breakfast was really good with a massive amount of choice for food from all different cultures, it did get quite busy at times however if you were there before 9:00am then it would be fine. We got room service a couple times and the food was really good, also whatever time they said it would take, it was always accurate.   The location of the hotel is very convenient for shopping as Orchard Road is about 5 minutes walk, there are also several nice restaurants very…",5,January 2019,
pleasant stay,13Astroboy,"the staff and the hotel are great, however we found the food in the main foyer wasnt the best, breakfasts had plenty of choice. You are walking distance to Orchard Rd where there are lots of shopping malls and restaurants but will need to take a cab everywhere else which is easy to do and fairly cheap. The pool is nice when there arnt many people around, we found guests put a towel onto the beds to secure it for the whole day which was annoying. Our room was clean and tidy, overall our stay was very good",4,January 2019,
This excellent hotel just got even better post it's extensive refurbishment,Datailover,"I'm in the middle of my second stay at the Shangri-La in a two month period. Having lived in Singapore for around 13 years previously, I chose the hotel because of its location and past happy experiences staying here. It's ideally situated slightly away from the bustle of the main Orchard Road shopping centres (although is a five minute walk away from the Northern end of Orchard Road) and is in a quiet largely residential area, close to the Botanic Gardens.   I've previously written a review saying how it was hard to go wrong with the hotel but, with its recent extensive refurbishment, it's got even better.  I've stayed in the Garden Wing (where my room was slightly larger) but also now in the Tower - which is equally good.  The hotel was looking a bit tired at the edges, but…",5,December 2018,
Well maintained hotel right near the main shopping district,sdgamer,We stayed at this hotel for two nights following our ten day cruise. The staff welcomed us even though we arrived three hours before check in. It is just a few blocks from the shopping area but with the humidity it felt like more. The best shopping is underground as we accidentally discovered when trying to figure out how to cross a street. The hotel appears to be in a residential district so if you're not going to eat at the hotel you have to walk to the shopping district. I hung out by the pool on my last day and it was lovely and relaxing. The italian restaurant onsite is just ok and I probably would not go there again. The breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and they had a ton of choices.,5,November 2018,
Expensive but the service is excellent.,804alinah,"Just had a New Year lunch buffet with family today at The Line Restaurant, and as expected the food was delicious and the service was excellent. Upon learning that it was my dad’s birthday, our server Grace immediately brought us a chocolate cake completed with a lit candle. The hotel also has a top notch kids club which my children (4-7) love. Everything is a little pricey as it is with a 5 star hotel but you definitely have a sense that you get what you pay for.

Outstanding quality,Sassyaston75,"We are a couple travelling with a three year old and chose a garden suite which overlooks the pool. Great choice. Absolutely enormous space with a bedroom that had a day bed and dressing table at one end, super king bed and ottoman, side tables and heaps of space to walk around. The walk through wardrobe area takes you to bathroom with rain shower or huge bath, bidet toilet and double sinks. The lounge has a comfortable couch and chairs, dining table, desk, sideboard, mini bar and shelving and extra loo. Baically, you’d be mad to have issue with this room. It’s outstanding. We had access to Horizon Lounge which was a long walk through to the lobby and up the tower. But we checked  out rooms in the tower and they were small and nothing like as good and palatial as the garden…",5,December 2018,
Best place for a family with kids,Amila S,"Great, but expensive hotel for a family. My kid loved the play area. Food is great, however bit on the expensive side. For example, lunch buffet will cost you around SG$ 75 per person (150 for two) where two people can dine very well under SG$50 in most of the other restaurants in the city. Service is wonderful as always. Will come again soon.",5,November 2018,
Buds by Shangri-La,Irfan,"I went over for my kids to enjoy themselves before school starts. I am pleased to mention how proactive the staff are when engaging with my kids. From registration all the way to leaving Buds, everyone has been kind and welcoming.

Not A Good Choice for Staycation,Kim7957,"We have booked two Deluxe Family Room (the only available family room) for our family staycation there at the cost $670 per room per night.  We arrived at the hotel after 3pm but I never expect the check-in to take us so long even after 3pm. There is no explanation on what am I entitled to during my check-in. No flexibility for guest with kids and being told it’s based on your room type that you have booked. Deluxe Family room at the 9th floor is not for families with kids? Then, please do not blame the children when they are playing around while we are queuing for check-in.  During our dinner at The Line restaurant, we were placed at outdoor corner. The walkway from outdoor seating to indoor restaurants at the Line has been blocked by other big groups customer and even the kids…",2,December 2018,
Exceeds expectations,dylarr,"I stayed here in December 2018, just prior to Christmas. This is the second time I've stayed at the Valley Wing at the Shangri-La Singapore. The first time was back in August this year. My mother and I planned this trip really around visiting this hotel again as our first stay here was so incredible.  Firstly, from the moment you drive up to the lobby for the first time and are greeted by the staff, you know you're in great hands. The check in process was incredibly personalised and prompt. The staff remembered us from our previous stay, and even put us in the same room again as we had commented how much we liked it the first time we stayed.  The rooms are lovely and spotless. Even in areas where you think dust would collect, there is none at all. The housekeeping in the Valley…",5,December 2018,
High standards,Colin D,"Despite being incredibly busy when we stayed here between Christmas and new year, I thought that the hotel managed to maintain very high levels of service.  We stayed in a garden wing pool view room which means you get a balcony which is great, particularly in the evenings.  They open up a few other breakfast options during this peak period, which is needed, as the Line is crazy busy.   This is a hotel full of young families, so if that’s not your preference, I’d suggest exploring other options over the holidays.  ",5,December 2018,
Very disappointed,BetinaAarhus,"I have faithfully returned to this hotel whenever I was in Singapore. Last time four years ago and now I am back, but I will not return. It has been a huge disappointment this time. It has dropped significantly in standard. It seems to have transformed into a children’s playground from the luxury business hotel it used to be. Even though I love kids I think this is too much.   The horizon club lounge now has a “family corner” for kids. The lounge used to be a magnificent place with a wonderful view from two sides to the beautiful city lights. Now it only has one side open and the other side is the food buffet and kitchen. It used to have several little sofa areas, now only very few and the rest is tables. It used to be nice with flower decoration at each table now there is…",2,December 2018,
Did a 3D 2N staycation with my 4-year old,Casiopia L,"We had a great experience at Shangri La Rasa Sentosa and thought we should give the one at Orange Grove/Orchard a shot. It was fantastic even though I did not get any shopping done along Orchard. Clean room, great bed, thoughtful amenities, friendly and efficient service always.  The vast estate with alot of greenery, orchids and waterfalls were nice for strolling and exploration. The pool accommodates adults doing laps and kids splashing amidst the fountain and shallow areas (pity no slides like the one at Sentosa) but it was compensated for by the dry outdoor playground - super good climbing experience at the pirate ship and wet outdoor playground (which was great for even small kids <4yr). The indoor BUDS playground is way better than the kids playground at Shangri La Rasa…",5,December 2018,

One could spend hours on the winding paths through the gardens that even featured a koi pond,  waterfall, and orchid gazebo. The room was immaculate and well appointed. In our case, the most diverse breakfast buffet we have ever encountered was included in our package.

This is my number one hotel globally,Christine B,"If you want value, exclusivity and luxury -look no further than the Valley Wing.  Read about this wing on the website.

We had five days there not enough. I didn’t want to leave.   When you stay in the Valley Wing there is no need to go anywhere. The Veuve  champagne starts at 11am and stops at 11.30pm.

Poor service and food,Haebee,"This hotel is well regarded both locally and internationally and the Island Ballroom has always been a good choice for weddings. So imagine our dismay when the food and service at the wedding last weekend turned out most disappointing. The appetisers started off the meal poorly, and the Laksa Pesto Linguine was served with prawns that were totally not fresh - Black at the head and belly, with powdery flesh. The wok fried kurobota pork was tough as leather. Even the Hasma dessert was too sweet and unexciting.

Horizon Lounge Made It A Great Stay & Relatively Easy Access to Botanic Gardens,steveamcb,"Whilst the room was absolutely fine (aside from a few minor issues initially in the bathroom), what made this stay great was all aspects of the Horizon Lounge:  the comfort and relaxation of the seating areas, the excellent food and drinks, and last but not least, the helpful and friendly staff;  Andreas Chan was especially engaging and responsive, whilst Mandy assisted me promptly with an external restaurant booking.  Although my daughter did not accompany me on this occasion, I noted that there was a specific area assigned to families, a very nice touch.

Cons - Firstly at the buds playground we enrolled our daughter for the activities and they did not even bother to lead her into the room for the dance activity, end up she had to miss a major amount of time for the activity.

Good hotel but the deposit????,MJRahman,So stayed here three nights. I mean great hotel. Decent location and service as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Staff were nice and helpful. But I do have one gripe and it’s a big gripe. They kept the equivalent of £475 as a deposit of my credit card. I mean I’ve stayed in 5 star hotels before and none have kept £475. Not even their Malaysian site kept that much from me. What did they think I was going to do? Most places keep £200ish for little mini bar treats and maybe the odd room service. But £475 for three nights? Not sure what the shangri la thought I might do. Anyway other then that.

Palms , trees and watching squirrels nearby. I love to be able to sit on the very private balcony and breathe in the air and that unique warm scent of Singapore.  Loved the occasional brief thunderstorms and rain, then back in the pool to cool off.  Grand foyer, choice of restaurants and friendly service.  Special thanks to concierge Raj. During our visits over the years he’s always there to ensure it’s a perfect holiday. Makes it that much more special. He was right to recommend their Origin …",5,December 2018,
Beautiful property,Peggi C,"We spent 3 days and nights. The property is spectacular. Didn't use the Spa or gym, but saw the facilities and they are amazing. Our only complaint is that 2 of the 3 restaurants were booked to wedding parties, so the only restaurant available was the Chinese restaurant. The Bar is AMAZING, and the bartender, Adam Eddy Bursik, is fantastic. They ven re-distill alcohol to make flavored alcohols. The Christmas Gin is incredible. It actually tastes like Christmas. Thank you, Eddy. Peggi & Steve",4,December 2018,
Holiday in Singapore,Graham J,"Great hotel ,fantastic staff and great food. Good location,need to use taxis to see all the sights. The light show from the top of Marina bay Sands in the evening at Larvo’s restaurant was amazing. A must to see are the gardens at the bay,two enormous domes house a fantastic display of trees and plants with an incredible waterfall.",5,November 2018,
yet again: a perfect stay,jasondayo,"stayed another two nights in Valley Wing on our way back from NZ to Europe. And again, it was a perfect stay - thks to the Valley Wing staff who were so helpful. When the room above ours was a bit noisy (newlyweds...), they immediately moved us onto a different floor the next morning, so all good. Shangri-La remains the hotel of our choice in Singapore.",5,November 2018,
Still outstanding,maggieallington,"Singapore is our favourite stop off during our annual visit to NZ from the UK.  We haven’t used this particular hotel for a while but have wonderful memories of previous stays.   The hotel has recently undergone a refurb and it continues to maintain the quality of excellence we remember. The recent addition of the facilities for children is outstanding.....even baking classes!   The evening buffet is amazing, with food stations from around the world. You can enjoy curry, sushi, lobster, wagyu beef, to name but a few mouth watering choices. There are also many superb ethic restaurants.  On our return in April we may consider upgrading to the luxurious Horizon Club. I have to add that the staff are delightful and nothing is too much trouble.",5,December 2018,
Excellent hotel,PPMMMM,"We arrived post cruise and was allocated a fabulous room - on the sixteenth floor - which was as requested, very quiet, with a stunning view over the city.  We were helped from the moment we arrived until we left, with the utmost professionalism and charm.  I can totally recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a luxurious and restful stay.  The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping on Orchard Road.  The pool is very large and the pool attendant excellent.  All the facilities we used were first class.  We dined in the Line Restaurant twice and also had breakfast there.  The choice was just incredible at breakfast.  On a Sunday evening there is an eat all you can buffet which was vast.  We felt totally valued and looked after for our whole stay and will definitely stay…",5,November 2018,
"Amazing Hotel, Great Service",Karen C,"We have stayed at the Shangri-La in Singapore numerous times. We were disappointed to see the red and gold panels in the lobby had been replaced with a live wall of plants, a pool and some odd figures. It could be Rome, Paris or London, it has lost its Asian feeling. But the rooms was lovely and service great. We had dinner in the Line restaurant and it took ages for food to arrive and it seemed a bit chaotic. However, in general it is a wonderful hotel. We were fans of the new bar which is off the lobby.",5,November 2018,
Outstanding valley wing staff,Escape34007,Thanks once again for the outstanding service we received again . Without a doubt Singapore’s best hotel well done . Cannot fault the hotel traveling for a living I spend a lot of time in hotels around the world but this The valley wing  is my favorite.,5,December 2018,
Staff that go over and above what is expected.,Perth_18,"My family stayed 6 nights in the Shangri-La Apartments, which is right next door to the hotel. We stayed in a 3 bedroom/3 bathroom apartment with living area, dining room and small kitchen....absolutely ideal for our 3 children aged 7 and under.   Despite being in the apartment, the hotel was less than a two minute walk. We walked across to the resort each morning and had a delicious buffet breakfast, a buffet fit for a king. We were able to utilise the resort swimming pool, however the apartment swimming pool and toddler splash pool was more than ample and still stunning, so we ended up using the apartments swimming pool more often.  The apartment was spotlessly tidy and housekeeping did a marvelous job each day. The kitchen had all the usual appliances and this proved very…",5,November 2018,
Service with a smile,Rod H,"Although the exterior is looking a bit dated, the renovation of rooms in the tower block makes them ideal for the business or leisure traveller. Whilst not the largest rooms that you might expect in a luxury hotel, the layout is very functional. However, when all is said and done, you mainly sleep in your room whereas you live in the hotel and here is where the Shangri-La shines. The service is impeccable. We invested in a club room and the amenity of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and canapes on the 24th floor was complemented by the warm welcome provided by the staff. Similarly, the staff around the pool couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming. Although our children are grown-up, the kid's club looks amazing and we hope to return with grandchildren someday.",5,November 2018,
Perfection. This is how a proper hotel works.,Elena,"The customer service was thoughtful and genuine, and the team at Shangri-La made our seven year old feel very welcome. It is a completely relaxing hotel, very clean, well cared for, and maintained with pride, through all levels of staff. The management should be very proud of their staff. The food is spectacular, and the little gestures that staff went to for children made us feel very special and appreciated as guests. We’ll be back for sure.",5,November 2018,
What a place - exceptional service and fantastic experience,Christian R,"My wife and I stayed at Shangri-la Singapore Valley wing during 4 nights and had an amazing time.  Coming here after being delayed on the flights by more than 8 hours and with our luggage even more delayed, they really took care of us from the minute we got here.  The check-in experience was great and was enhanced with afternoon tea, champagne and a lot empathy for our situation. They even helped us get temporary clothes and offered express cleaning.  Throughout the stay we were met with the same level of service wherever we went, always kind, generous and always very professional.  The hotel itself is also great. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was big and very comfortable. The pool area was equally pleasant.  One of the benefits with staying in the Valley Wing…",5,December 2018,
Best of the Best,owemik,"Beautiful hotel just minutes walk from Orchard road.  The Shangri-la is luxurious with unparalleled service.  Amenities include a top-class fitness center with wet/dry saunas and a whirlpool.  The hotel also has a Spa with Asia-inspired wellness and massage offerings.  There are also several restaurants within the hotel offering local cuisine as well as Italian, Japanese, Chinese, and steak.  The restaurants also cater to travelers with celiac as they offered multiple gluten friendly options.  Finally, the hotel is a great place for families as it offers a dedicated breakfast area, a kid's baking kitchen, and swimming pool, and an indoor playscape.  The only downside is that the prices are a little steep and its a 15 min walk or more for other food options.",5,December 2018,
Outstanding hotel,JMN,"Even although the hotel was clearly busy, the service was seamless and outstanding.  Room was in the garden wing and was extremely luxurious and comfortable.  Very high quality breakfast buffet.  Good gym with friendly staff.  Hotel is only a short taxi hop into town.  Highly recommend.",5,December 2018,
Excellent hotel,yss97,"We stayed in the Garden Wing. The room was spacious and had a balcony overlooking some gardens. The bed and pillows were comfortable. A bonus was a Netpresso machine in the room with complimentary pods. Check-in and check-out was smooth. 5 stars. But, the breakfast buffet was less than perfect, so hence the 4 stars. The place was packed on the Sunday morning and we ended up outside after a short queue. Although it was in the shade, it was still a bit hot and sticky, and the service was not so good, as we needed to make at least 2 requests for tea/coffee (each time) before it appeared. Inside, the staff did not seem to know where every thing was - my enquiry asking where the butter and jam was elicted the response that it should be there - pointing to where I had just come from.…",4,December 2018,
Wonderful Service,Skytov,"The Shagri-La Singapore is a fantastic hotel.  Very friendly service.  Bellman Faireen made us feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble.  True class!  The service and warmth and attention we received from Nicole, Raj, Manav, and Govinda was everything one would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Thank you you for a wonderful experience!",5,November 2018,
Very comfortable stay,Leslie L,"We stayed here one night (Saturday night) as we attended my niece’s wedding solemnisation and wedding banquet held at Shangri-La hotel. The garden room that we had was luxurious and very comfortable. The gym was very well equipped. Breakfast buffet was included in our room rate for three adults. The breakfast was very good indeed with a very wide selection of western, Chinese and Indian cuisine. Go early for breakfast. When I went to the gym at 7.40 am there was hardly anyone having breakfast at the Line restaurant. When we went at 9 am to the Line restaurant for breakfast there was a very long queue and about a ten minute wait. Staff members were extremely helpful and courteous. We had a very pleasant stay indeed.",5,December 2018,
A true paradise- the name fits!,amandareavis,"We could not imagine a better experience. Our stay at the Shangri-La was heavenly. From the welcome with a beautiful orchid and a glass of champagne, the impeccable and thoughtful house keeping, delicious food, beautiful surroundings, and acommodation for a late check out, from start to finish, our stay was incredible and perfect. We would recommend a vacation at the Shangri La to anyone we know. Thank you so much for a wonderful trip! We will be dreaming about when we can come back!",5,November 2018,
My Visit to Shangri-La Singapore,Chamindra Sulakshith,"We visited the Shangri La Singapore on the 23rd of November 2018 to celebrate the birthday of my youngest sister. We were a group of 6 adults and we loved the hotel and its atmosphere. We were served very well by the staff there and they attended to all our needs very quickly and kindly.   Frankly I never expected the same level good care and attention we are used to receiving at Star class hotels in Sri Lanka in Singapore, but to my surprise the hotel staff at Shangri La Singapore were exceptionally very kind and caring. Based on this brief visit I will really look forward to staying at the Shangri La Singapore in my future visits to Singapore.",5,November 2018,
One of the best,Ajb1207,"Just enjoyed a fantastic 4 night stay at The Shangri-La Singapore. We opted for a Horizon club room which had benefits of a lounge on the 23rd floor serving breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés. The service from the moment we checked in was outstanding. The food was all excellent with good variety. Orchard a road is a 10 minute walk downhill from the hotel, but taxis are always available and cheap. Will definitely be our hotel of choice on our next visit.",5,November 2018,
Top quality hotel,russell s,"on a stop over for a couple of days flying between Scotland and New Zealand.  i have been lucky enough to stay here previously, but not for a number of years.  the hotel is beautifully appointed and has wonderfully attentive staff.   i stayed in the Garden wing with a pool view, which i would say is the ideal if you are willing to pay the premium for a balcony.",5,November 2018,
Comfortable hotel,Utterchaos,"This is a very comfortable hotel, in a great location for Orchard Road shopping and many sightseeing activities. The range of food available within the hotel is very broad, and room service is reasonable. The thing that will do your head in is the lighting in the rooms! It is a strange puzzle to get just the level of lighting required as lights are grouped onto switches. We were alternately dazzled or plunged into complete darkness as we tried to get it right! Sunset from the Horizon Club is not to be missed.   ",4,November 2018,
SIMPLY THE BEST,roseruss,"Stayed 2 nights in the Tower of this totally charming Hotel. Very relaxing in a great location on the hill just a short walk to Orchard Road.  Surrounded by beautiful gardens and with a swimming pool area and large well appointed rooms, you feel as if you are truly in a Resort.  The Executive Lounge is second to none with the most capable  staff led by Jenny who provided an amazing friendly service and helpful information on how we should spend our time in Singapore.",5,November 2018,
Birthday Celebration,cherishqqq,"We had an amazing staycation at the family themed room. Kids loved the castle theme room, playing at the indoor and outdoor playground as well as the huge variety of food at The Line. What made the stay memorable was the superb service by the staff. Special shoutout goes to Cory for coordinating everything, Thabar for his attentiveness at The Line and Amirah who is always full of smile at Buds. Highly recommended for family with young kids!

4 WONDERFUL DAYS,Peter B,"Our suite in the Valley Wing was spacious and well appointed. Very impressed by all the staff, always smiling and very helpful. The Horizon Club, renovated since our visit last year, impressed with the selection of finger food and fine wine. However the highlight was the staff. We were surprised that the lovely Angeline was a trainee. She presented as an experienced professional, courteous and always smiling and ready to help. And of course Amir was the experienced professional, who supervised wonderful service by all the staff. The omelettes made by Connie are a must have. The Origin Grill was great, and we were privileged to meet the Head of Cuisine, Heidi.",5,November 2018,
Valley Wing,salisbury16,This is a true 5 star hotel! Service and amenities are really what one expects of this wing of the hotel.  Everything is perfect from breakfast to pre dinner canapés. Having stayed here on numerous occasions I would highly recommend this hotel to the discerning traveller.,5,November 2018,
Perfect stay,nhnycgirl,"Everything about our stay was top notch: our room, the breakfasts, the Horizon Lounge, Nami Japanese restaurant, and the public spaces. The service was uniformly warm and professional. We reserved through Amex Plat Fine Hotels and instead of upgrading our room, we were given access to the Horizon Lounge, a much better benefit. We loved our room in the Garden Wing and can't wait to stay at Shangri-La again!",5,November 2018,
Pre cruise visit,Alison K,"We booked 2 extra nights in the hotel before picking up our cruise ship . The room was beautiful, well furnished, kept very clean as you would expect. Everything there that was needed, I particularly liked the furnishings.  Plenty of choice for breakfast , ample seating , pleasant outside , but agree with previous review about cafeteria effect if eating inside.  We decided to eat in hotel on last night, sadly we didn’t book The fancier restaurants and ended up in the same restaurant as breakfast time. The price for buffet was extortionate, $ 95 per person, but as the waiter said ‘ there is a lot of food to choose from’ !   Instead we ate ‘a la carte ‘ and was so disappointed . My husband was asked how his meal was and he replied , ‘ok’,  however although I had left most of my…",2,November 2018,
Kinda fooled??,bobby wiryaseputra,"Hotel was great, room was awesome, reception staffs were horrible, i have booked a tower wing room for 3 nights, while i arrived at receptions table, the staff, Yang Long, if not mistaken, said that tower wing room is max for 3 persons, i came with my wife and 2 daughters, 2years old and 1 years. Because of that i must upgrade to garden wing room if i want to stay in the same room for 100SGD before tax.  When checked out, i asked another staff for that matter, she said it is okay to stay in tower wing room if i didn’t bothered to stay in one bed with my kids, because it will be cramped, (....... after a long sigh), i told her, whatever the room i stayed in, i would sleep altogether on one bed, and i’m guessing, for a famous chain hotel like Shangrila, u will get a king size bed…",3,November 2018,
Excellence !,Peter W,"Room was spacious and had everything required. I am disabled and the room was one of the best for people like me that I have encountered. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The included breakfast was excellent and the range of food impressive. The hotel  appearance, particularly the gardens, was of the highest standard.  The only disappointment was the room service meal, which was rather bland and not up to the standard of the rest of the hotel.",5,November 2018,
Fantastic service!,Lance K,"Visited this establishment to have dinner with my friends at origin bar and grill. All I can say is that atmosphere at the bar is something that is not to be missed. Lighting is nicely dimmed (romantic), attentive wait staff, music is not too loud where you can have a comfortable conversation with whoever that you're there with, and also feast your eyes and tastebuds on their wide range of cocktails. For a complete experience, visit the restaurant section which features unique and delectable dishes that's carefully crafted to please your instagram followers and stomach. ",5,November 2018,

Staycation with the kids at Shangri-La Singapore,Jenny,"The staff are attentive and personalised. Service standard is high and they makes the hotel guests feel pampered. For example, staff who will hold the lift for guests if they happen to be there even at other levels, staff who will smile and acknowledge you when they see you, etc. They even prepared a kitkat cum M&Ms birthday cake for my younger girl who celebrated her birthday during her stay - she was beaming with joy when she saw the beautiful cake.   There are indoor and outdoor facilities to keep the kids occupied and happy - allowing the parents to catch a breather. The kids and i are very happy and enjoyed our stay here.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience and keep up the good work! Well done to the service crew! Keep up the great work!",5,November 2018,
Another amazing stay in this wonderful hotel,anselmdavid,"We were here last, in July 2017 and decided to stay here again for longer than 7 days. However, we chose the Garden Wing this time with a balcony overlooking the city view. As per usual the standard and service, not only in our room but overall was beyond reproach. This considering our stay there coincided with the visit of the Malaysian Prime Minister and also the first time visit of the Russian Premier, Putin to Singapore. As with such visit amidst tight security etc, there was minimal disruption for guest and this must be a credit to the staff and management of the hotel.  Should anyone consider visiting Singapore, this is the location to rest and recuperate before venturing the sights and scenes of the city, you will not regret it. Thanks for another wonderful stay and well…",5,November 2018,
Mr,Rajendra B,"Stayed in Shangrila Apartments Singapore during Nov 11-17, 2018. It’s a lovely place to stay with family. Quiet place. Staff is very friendly. The house keeping team is very polite, helpful and prompt. They used to promptly arrange cabs for us every day.  We were there to celebrate my daughter’s 18th birthday. They surprised her by arranging small celebration for her. It really touched being in a foreign country. I would definitely recommend this place for family stays. ",5,November 2018,
Valley Wing is certainly a luxury hotel.,MRA,"What impressed me most about this hotel is their arrangements for breakfast. You choose from a menu and it is served at your table and mercifully you do not encounter the roomful of dishes at a buffet that most hotels now offer. I stayed at the Valley Wing. The rest of the stay was comfortable, satisfying and I will very much recommend it to anyone willing to spend more for the comfort of a suite. The rooms are well appointed. The TV in living room is good but the one in the bedroom is not of the same standard. The staff are pro active and polite which is, to my mind which is the great differentiator of a great hotel.",5,November 2018,
Fabulous,GLOSSOPGLOBETROTTERS,"A two night stay before our onward flight to Chiang Mai. A beautiful hotel ideally located for Orchard Road and around a brisk 15 minute walk to the Orchard MRT Station but the hotel does have a shuttle bus if you don’t feel like walking. We stayed in the garden wing which offered a good sized room, furnished to a high standard as expected from any Shangri -La hotel but it also had a balcony which we like. Breakfast which was served in the Italian restaurant by the pool was outstanding with an amazing choice. The bars & lounge also had a great atmosphere, we only tried their bar menu but what we chose was well presented and enjoyable. The gardens are well kept as is the pool area, there is also a fabulous Koi Carp pool. Lovely to stroll round in the evening. Staff whether from…",5,August 2018,

Big Disappointment,MCH,"Stayed in the Tower Wing which had very noisy and old ventilation system.  Key card did not work because the card reader was out of battery.  The furniture in the Family Suite had sharp edges posing risks to children. Very rough facial tissues and toilet papers, only provided softer ones after request. Makes one wonder if the management is cutting cost. Service was just ok and not particularly efficient.  Hard to believe this is Shangri-la's flagship property.",2,August 2018,
Wonderful service; a 5 star hotel that does walk the extra mile,hannekes2014,"Of course one can expect great service in a 5 star hotel, but Shrangri La at Orange road does provide this service.

Too much to mention but here are some of the highlights: Free pram hire Night light when sleeping with kids was perfect and even one in the bathroom which was great as you didn’t need to turn on the lights and disturb the kids.

Nice 5 Star Property- Quietness in the midst of the city and next to Shopping paradise Lane - Orchard Road,Sumit Singhal,Went to Shangri-la Singapore in mid Oct2018 for a conference and find it a nice place to be in. The City View it gives is so serene as it does not show you the city traffic and you intend to have a feeling of living in a country side property. Nice and Courteous staff with good facilities around. became more famous after famous Kim Trump Summit. Walkable distance from famous Orchard Road for all Shopohlic people who want to pick their liking stuff day in day out.  As a personal liking -- I like the Mom and Son Murals they have in their main lobby.  Nice artistic view with uniqueness.,5,October 2018,

One of the great hotels of Singapore,AFFrequentFlyer,"This was my first stay at the Shangri-La in Singapore. Its a grand old dame which has kept its reputation going since the 1970s when it was established. Its a 7 minute walk from Orchard Road (slightly uphill coming back!!!) but a free hotel shuttle provides regular services to ION Orchard. I was in the executive room with access to the executive lounge on the 25th (top) floor - great views, wonderful breakfast! The hotel prides itself on great service and I fully endorse that. If I am to criticise anything: the swimming pool is NOT for laps ... its a flower shape ornamental pool for kids and dads to frolic; basically - its tiny, therefore I could not do my laps or swim properly (weekends its a beehive).

Extremely Family Friendly Hotel,Rieska12,"I think the hotel won my kids who are 4 and 2 - from the first 5 mins they set foot at the lobby. They were greeted by lovely receptionist with cookies on hand. And as the lobby is spacious, the cookies were great incentives to stop both kids from running around. The check in process was seamless, everyone was so helpful. Information about the kids club was given straight after we check in to the hotel. The kids club was amazing - it was new I think, extremely clean and so much fun, the hotel also run free baking class for older kids, singing session, etc (can’t remember the others.

Beautiful hotel,LKN,"We loved the hotel. The amenities are many and so well laid out. The pool and pool area are great for anyone including families. So accessible. I did not give the rating an excellent as A few of the employees were not as hospitable as the last two Shangri-La hotels we stayed at in Thailand on this trip. For example, the Consierge would not give us a steak house recommendation outside the hotel because he wanted us to eat in the hotel. My guess is he was somehow connected to the restaurant. That recommendation at the Origin was not a good experience. We missed a good night on the town because of this gentleman. Just please be honest.",4,October 2018,
People Not Buildings,Michelle J,"As the delightful check in lady ushered me out of the limousine directly to my room, after a perfectly executed transfer, I mentioned that I wasn't so much interested in the refurbished building but whether SLS had retained its magical people skills. I wasn't disappointed.   The In Room Entertainment needed a fix - done immediately, and from then on as my brain came back into gear over 48 hours all was perfectly executed.   Room Service - Great Food On Time. Reception Support - Correct and Swift.  Bell Boy Support - Grease lightening were they waiting outside?  And so I could enjoy the mini hanging gardens of Babylon vibe of the Garden Wing and a room with a Verandah, very nice, and the gym and the pool and the walk to the retail therapy.   There were quite a lot of people…",5,October 2018,
Fantastic place,vagabond,One of the best hotel for staying in Singapore..Hotel is located in Central part of city and environment is amazing...Everybody must enjoy food here...Amazing experience and enjoyed a lot here....Excellent....,5,October 2018,
Genuinely lovely people work here.,Reganandrew,First time staying at a Shanghai La Hotel so we did not know what to expect as we usually prefer smaller boutique style hotels or private properties as large hotel chains so often disappoint and feel soulless.  However we have been absolutely delighted by The Shangri La at Orange Grove Singapore.  It’s a beautifully decorated hotel immaculately maintained with genuinely lovely staff. The hotel feels stylish and elegant and the room is super quiet and very very comfortable.  The location is also well placed for all Singapore’s main attractions.  We would definitely stay again and can highly recommend the hotel. Horizon club is also worth the upgrade. The pool and gardens are great plus there are two excellent tennis courts.,5,October 2018,
Absolutely Loving It,Sylvia T,"If budget is not a constraint, this hotel is perfect for a family or couple to stay.   Checking is fast and staff are polite, friendly and helpful. Food from the hotel lobby and The Line is delicious. We ordered a tea set in the afternoon after check in, ala carte dinner and breakfast at The Line.  You can also book the outdoor restaurant space for a special occasion. Ideal for a proposal.  There is a children’s play area beside the restaurant which is open to public. Hotel guests can get a discount for their kids for indoor and outdoor play area. Quite worth it.  The hotel is near to Orchard road yet private enough to enjoy, relax and recharge. Absolutely love it. ",4,October 2018,
Lunch and Dinner at the Origin Grill - first with wifey then with family of 3 generations!,KeithGregory,We had a family night out to celebrate my son’s success over post medical registrar exams. After weeks of hard work and preparation thought it was fitting to have a celebration over a sumptuous dinner with the family of 3 generation. This was my second visit at Origin Grill.  First was an executive set lunch I had with my better half which offered value for money and good bite size portion: not too heavy for the afternoon meal. Perfect set meal as far as my wife and I were concerned. The various house poured I had and the dessert port wine made it a pleasant afternoon. My wife obviously had to drive who hardly drank more than a glass of red with her eyes trained on me as I happily seep the “grape juice”.haha..  The dinner ambience was perfect in the private room for 8 pax.  We…,5,October 2018,
Brunch at Rose verandah,aakhanna,"As in the past we once again came back for the Iconic fare at Rose verandah . Whilst the ambience look and feel is always fresh the food item spread  and desserts were as usual very well presented and tastes also delicious . The Japanese sushi sashimi were good however could have been better . Same for the  dimsums - taste average . The sea bass in local Sambal chilli sauce was a nice addition as was the sea food Catalana made up of squid, prawn and salmon ... The hazel nut ice-cream and strawberry sorbet were superb.  The choice of teas and coffees was as good as any where else if not better . Highly recommended !",5,October 2018,
"Tranquility & relax, despite busy surrounding ",afongsk,"Friendly staff who are ever ready to greet you start from the moment you stepped into the hotel main entrance. The Tower Wing deluxe room was expectedly clean and well provided with stationery and easy wifi connection, though the king-size bed tends to make the room a bit squeezing. The bathroom was huge with the expected quality toiletries . The breakfast was sumptuous and located just outside its dining area is the outdoor swimming pool surrounded by matching landscape plants. Overall, a highly satisfying stay and  wished we had more times to enjoy the facilities.   ",5,September 2018,
A great option but needs to up its game!,PhillipP,"I spent three nights at the Shangri La, staying in the Valley Wing; what the hotel classes as its most luxurious wing.    Although this will soon undergo renovation, with the Garden and Tower Wings having recently re-opened following their own renovations, the hotel is still in a mostly excellent condition, minus some very tired and worn out carpets.  Part of what differentiates the Valley Wing from the rest of the hotel, is a more personalised service as well as the complimentary provision of drinks and snacks throughout the day at different parts of the hotel, be it the main lobby, the Summit Room or the pool area.    My room was big and spacious with large windows overlooking the pool. The marble and wood decor is traditional Shangri La, with a large spacious bathroom, with…",4,December 2017,
Everything a great hotel should be,Skaula,"We spent 7 nights at the Shangri-La Singapore and loved it. It was everything we hoped it would be.

It is the perfect place to unwind with a vibrant city on your doorstep.",5,October 2018,
Faultless Valley Wing,James H,"Last day of a fantastic 7 night stay in the valley wing....everything about this hotel is class.... facilities too many to mention.... service 1st class....pool environment stunning....food amazing..... we stayed in the valley wing which I booked directly through the hotel website and f ankle was an amazing deal.... room and breakfast would have been good value in itself but then add in complimentary afternoon tea, evening canapés, champagne and drinks all day and this must go down as one of the best value places in the whole of Singapore. The rooms and class of the valley wing are worth paying a bit more for... separate entrance and you can see why so many heads of state choose to stay here... well done to the hotel and all it’s staff.",5,October 2018,
Excellent in every way and all ways,Sush21,"We stayed at the Shangrila with our 2 year old toddler and it was the best stay decision we could have made . We stayed at the valley wing deluxe suite and everything was just perfect. The room was very spacious with elegant decor. The room was well stocked with goodies , chocolates, fresh fruits , drinks, magazines and our favourite nespresso all of which was diligently restocked everyday. The housekeeping was immaculate and turndown service was twice a day.   The lobby staff and front desk staff was most helpful and very friendly and pleasant; always available for any queries or any general help like taxi booking etc .

Shangri-La Singapore,Martin W,We stayed at The Shangri-La in the Valley Wing. This is almost impressive hotel with excellent service. The rooms are beautify decorated and very comfortable.

7 stars fabulous,Diane D,Stayed here in October what a hotel from we arrived till we left first class service. The hotel is stunning. Our room was on the. 11th floor with pool. Views well equipped and spotless. The restaurants were fantastic food top  notch. The breakfast was great with champagne. Plenty fir everyone the pool area was lovely very large pool the gardens were very well kept. This hotel is well worth the cost you are treated like royalty it’s also within walking distance of the restaurants shops and bars the staff are friendly and very professional there uniforms are even spoyand very smart the managers are always visible and ask how your stay is the light music in the foyer bar is nice to listen too over  a drink. First class hotel,5,October 2018,
Luxurious hotel that is totally kid friendly!,dknydino13,"We stayed in the Deluxe Family room for 5 nights in October with two children under 3.  The room was lovely and the wing we stayed on was so useful.  We were able to cook in the pantry which allowed us to prepare solid food, great as our younger one refuses pouch food and we were able to wash our clothes halfway through our trip.  Furthermore we were provided both a high chair and buggy.  The facilities were wonderful - our older one loved the Buds and he went there everyday.  due to meeting relatives (try to avoid going at weekends as its super busy), it is a shame that we did take more advantage of the wet play and pool areas.",5,October 2018,
Serviced apartments work really well,Frank B,The serviced apartments at the Shangri-la are comfortable and more spacious than the hotel rooms and offer a pool next to the building and also easy access to all of the services of the main hotel.  This is the best serviced apartment deal we have experienced in Singapore both in terms of quality and amenities as well as price/value.  Highly recommend.,5,October 2018,
Needed more time,Bafe-of-Melb,Great experience by any measure. Staff were very welcoming and attentive on arrival and check-in.  Room upgrade is never a bad thing and our was excellent.  Appreciated the inclusions of fruit drinks etc   Room was quiet the blinds were excellent and the view was surprisingly good.  Slept like the dead which is always a good sign.  Had a quick walk around and the pool facilities and other restaurants etc look excellent.  Check out was also an easy experience.  We will definitely be back,5,October 2018,
This has to be the best hotel I have stayed in.,clairelouise_8,"From stepping out of our car, we were made to feel special, even though we possible we’re not looking at our best after the long haul flight. All the staff were polite, friendly and attentive.  We were given an upgrade to a suite, which was just pure luxury with magnificent views.  Attention to detail was evident everywhere. We sat in the bar late on our first evening and despite not being on the menu The barman made me the best ever Singapore Sling. The breakfast was in my view spectacular, I had to walk round twice just to take in the overwhelming choice.  I hope that we can come back here as our stay was just not long enough.",5,October 2018,

It was our first family holiday with out young son, Jack and we now have life time long happy memories. We had access to to the Horizon Club lounge which was perfect with our young traveller. there is a special designated area for families, which means that the children can play while Mum and Dad enjoy a beverage between 5 and 6.30pm. The nightly canapés were delicious. Overall we were in heaven and didn't want it to end. We hope to be back soon.

What a wonderful time we had and the Valley Wing staff made my sister's Birthday enjoyable and a day we will always remember.  They are truly exceptional.  When returning from a day's outing they welcome us home.  When cleaning our room they are so discreet and very rarely seen or heard.  When tempting us at breakfast they provide further options not on the menu.  Evening drinks (champagne or a wide selection of still wine and cocktails, teas and coffee)  in the Valley Wing with canapes and Khristina playing the harp is truly an experience not to be missed.

Our grandson called it ""Granny's house"", and for us it certainly felt like home from home.",5,March 2018,
Very Good Hotel but there is room for improvement,flavell,We stayed here for 4 nights and found the facilities and room excellent and very clean as ever with the staff at Shangri-La hotels the staff were excellent.  Room for improvements concerns breakfasts the food is not kept hot enough and plates were cold. The best way to get hot food was at the stations where food was cooked to order and get your own coffee the waiters brought tepid at best but get your own it is piping hot. The food selection is fantastic but attention to keeping it hot is essential. The decor in the dining area was not to my personal taste. The ASEAN military conference proved somewhat of an inconvenience with the extra security armed police and army security checkpoints concrete blocks and CCTV a little alarming and whilst the hotel tried to keep things going…,4,October 2018,

As a frequent visitor to both the Hotel (Tower Wing, Garden Wing and the very exclusive Valley Wing) we knew what to expect in terms of great accommodation, hospitality, professionalism, efficiency, tasty food but most of all the friendliness of all staff.  Of course we were not let down.   How lovely to return to a place where staff who previously greeted your young children (Hotel Pool people Raymond and Bernard) now greet the younger generation (5 year old grandson).

I had booked 2 inter-connecting Tower Wing Deluxe Rooms (One King and One Twin Room, with an extra bed) however upon check-in we were advised that the room could not accommodate an extra bed as there was not enough space. No bother, the check-in staff apologized for the miss-understanding and gave us a complimentary upgrade to two interconnecting Garden Wing Deluxe Room, which could accommodate the extra bed. A very nice gesture and very much appreciated.

We asked for Kate check out as our flight left at 10pm and we checked out at 2pm and were kinder offered to use their spa showers at any time before our flight, which they organised the best time with traffic and booked taxi for us. The location I found great, food was fantastic. We will be returning here.. it definitely aided in us falling in love with Singapore , what a beautiful city and genuinely friendly people.

Lovely hotel,wishiwasawaytoday,"The hotel is beautiful, lobby is stunning with lots of greenery and artwork. We stayed for the children’s facilities and weren’t disappointed. Kids club amazing, the outdoor water playground also fabulous. Our daughter (aged 7) raved about them both and really enjoyed the time she spent in the kids club and water playground.  We had a family package, and were supposed to be on the family friendly floor especially for kids. Unfortunately they had overbooked so we were located on another floor, and as such we did not receive any kids amenities in our room and to call and request them for our children.

Very happy Valley Wing Customers,Banjo-Daisy,"We stayed at the Shangri-La Singapore from 29 September until 1 October (our first visit, but certainly not our last) as a stop-over on our trip home from London, to assist us with jetlag recovery. As soon as we pulled up in our car we were greeted by the resplendently attired doorman eager to take the luggage before showing us into the entrance lobby. The cool lobby was a real contrast to the heat of the outside. A lovely team member (Vanessa) commenced the check-in process before whisking us up to the 7th floor.   The Valley Wing was absolutely fabulous. From the moment we checked in we were treated liked a valued customer, even though we hadn't been there before.

The hotel was very nice with an excellent pool area. Club had a very good selection of food and drink and was good value for money.

Exceptional,NXM76,"This hotel is fantastic!!!  It will take me too long to capture all the things this hotel is doing right.  First, we travelled with our two kids (8 and 5) and arrived late at night.  We had booked a themed family suite and our check in was in the room so that the kids could familiarise themselves and not have to wait downstairs in the lobby after an 8 hour journey to get there.  That was a thoughtful beginning and our stay continued in that manner.  The room was so beautiful.  The parent's area was great (eating area, comfortable bed and small bathroom).  The kids room was massive, had a castle (with two beds in it), a mural on the wall, a hidden TV, a hidden door, a large bathroom with lowered toilet and a bath tub and kids toiletries (and nappies if you need them), and kids…",5,September 2018,

"World-class hotel, highly recommended.",09A,"Recently stayed here for 4-nights as part of a business trip. The hotel was busy managing multiple groups and also conferences. However, what surprised me is that staff is always composed and able to deal with different guests' requests with no major hassle. Staff we bumped into always smile and courteous, which i was most impressed and a reflection of a world-class training and truly a 5-star hotel. Please keep up the good work. Shuttle to Orchard Rd is also handy, but do get full quickly. Otherwise it is a short-stroll or a short taxi ride.

Outstanding service,Bart,During our stopover in Singapore after an Indonesia trip we stayed in the Shangri-La Valley Wing. The feeling of luxury after a few weeks of 'back to basics' was simply amazing. Large room with perfect bed and huge bathroom was a perfect way to finish our break. On top of the great room the service level in the vally wing is simply the best in Singapore.

Child Friendly Shower Facilities Required for Better Experience,Sue Y,"The children all had a grand time at Buds at Shangrila’s indoor playground.  The set up encouraged a lot of active play.  The charges also included access to the outdoor water play ground which was very well built and incorporated interesting water activities.  However we were grossly disappointed with the lack of proper shower facilities nearby or at the water play area.  Instead we found that the available bathrooms near the pool and near the Health spa were too far and did not fully cater to children.  I would think that a 5 star hotel that offers a water play area would be equally sensitive to catering to shower stalls with basic amenities like children’s bath soap and shampoo, more conveniently located to the water play area!  It is not appropriate for children who are…",4,October 2018,

Chosen as a spot of out of town luxury for a special birthday we were not disappointed. You can make a grand arrival to be met by traditionally dressed doormen. We were then ushered across to check in and then had a nice surprise to find that as we were staying in a Tower Wing Horizon Club Deluxe Room we could check in at the Horizon Club Lounge on the 24 floor - we were escorted there by Peter from the Lobby Team and checked in while we had a complimentary drink with no fuss by Rachel.

The Horizons Club was great - a large lounge on the top floor with great views. The food took it to another level - beautifully crafted cocktail food and afternoon tea 'snacks.'

"I really wanted to give it 5-stars, I really did",myszka0611,"Shangri-La is most definitely a 4.5 star hotel though, but didn't quite meet our expectations for a 5.  The hotel is exquisite, it truly is.  From the nubbed silk uniforms donned by some of their staff, to the understated elegance of the lobby, to the beautifully manicured grounds, to the well-stocked library, to the high teas they offer, Shangri-La is a grand and refined property.  A few minor hiccups kept us from rating it a 5.0, and it mainly had to do with housekeeping.  One day, we arrived back at the room at 4:45PM to find our room had not been cleaned.

Sets the standard for Shangri-la globally,Justbobhrh,"Stayed for 6 days with my family in the middle of a long business trip.  We had adjoining rooms (Junior Suite - 686 - which is massive) and 687 (twin room and we had an extra roller bed).  2 Adults and 4 kids. it was hot and we were tired so we  spent a lot of time in the hotel.  The grounds are lush and green with amazing and huge pool.  We ate at The Line (breakfast and lunch on some days) and also Waterfall (Italian).  Waterfall in particular was amazing (also with great wine selection). We also enjoyed the Horizon Club for breakfasts some days and pre-dinner drinks.  We also went to the Japanese on Level 24, also very good and authentic Japanese. We had such a relaxing and lovely time that we didnt really venture out of the hotel that much (except to hawker markets for two…",5,August 2018,
Fabulous deluxe hotel ideal for business or pleasure,Mark G,"This exquisite hotel is the place to stay in Singapore!  As in all Shangri-La hotels the staff are fantastic and from the moment you arrive are incredibly attentive and helpful. The hotel itself is large with several wings. I stayed in the rooms accessed via the lift from the main reception. These seemed recently renovated and had a very comfortable king bed, shower, bath, desk, couch and flat screen tv. The wardrobe was made of glass which is perhaps a little unnecessary but you can live with it.  Outside of your room the gym is large and well equipped, there is a good size outdoor pool and a large indoor soft play area for kids. The exec lounge serves a good breakfast as does the main restaurant which has many stations with breakfast options from around the world. I ate in the…",5,September 2018,
Always first class!,Sylvia F,Have attended meetings here in the past and this time had the good fortune to stay for two weeks in a garden view room which was spacious and well-appointed.

5 Star Hotel with 6 Star Customer Service,Stuart P,"I recently stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore with my wife to celebrate a major birthday.  The hotel has recently been totally refurbished throughout, including the grand lobby & reception area and all the rooms in the Tower wing, where we stayed. The hotels luxurious new interior compliments the beautiful gardens that surround the hotel. I have stayed at a number of 5 star hotels in Singapore and none have the feeling of space and tranquility that is afforded at the Shangri-La. The pool area is large enough to accommodate plenty of guests without the worry of getting in someone’s way like so many of the other hotels.  While this beautiful hotel has had a make over, it was the incredible level of customer service that really made our trip so memorable. From the moment…",5,September 2018,
Superb experience,Natasha T,"My husband and I recently stayed at the shangri-la last week for his 50th birthday. We have stayed there often over the past 17 years and have gotten to know the staff and feel very much at home, which is why we chose the hotel to celebrate such an important occasion. We were not disappointed.  The hotel was excellent. We stayed in a junior suite which was well appointed, clean and very comfortable. We enjoyed the hospitality of the horizons club and ate at the origin grill and line restaurant. All were excellent. For us, the reason we return to the shangrila-la is not just for the excellent facilities but the staff. We travel a lot and we feel that the staff at this hotel exceed expectations and standards worldwide. We would like to make a special mention to vijay, who is…",5,September 2018,

What a place!,Brett N,We are on our way back to Brisbane from Europe and we always stay in Singapore to help overcome the jet lag. This is the first time we have stayed at Shangri-La and it won’t be the last.  The property is set on acres and acres of land with beautiful gardens full of orchids and flowering ginger and bougainvillea. We were greeted by friendly staff at the door and reception and a lovely girl showed us to our room in the Tower Wing. We also had use of the Horizon Club Lounge which was absolutely fabulous on the 24th floor. The property is a bit further from the Bay but we wanted to just relax around the enormous pool which had plenty of  pool lounges for everyone so it was perfect for us. In summary if you want to stay at a hotel for a relaxing stay in amazing gardens with several…,5,September 2018,
Good choice if you fancy something a bit different,Martin G,The Shangrila is a 15-20 taxi ride away from the central business area.  The hotel has a resort complex feel with a generous outdoor pool.  The breakfast selection is suitably international with a very wide choice of cuisines and dishes.  The amazing Botanicsl gardens are a 20 minute walk from the hotel. The garden’s stay open until midnight and the paths are well lit. They are well worth a visit.  I would also definitely recommend the Shangrila.,5,September 2018,

Book the Executive Lounge,gjohnturner,"We arrived early morning at the Shangri-La and were met from the taxi by a doorman who whisked our bags off (we did get them back!), leaving us to sample complimentary tea at reception while checking in. As the room wasn't yet available, we explored the pool area which is basically the same as you'd get at a resort - an unlikely find in the middle of a major city..  The room (junior suite) was beautiful; I particularly liked the automatic curtains :), and the free water was useful if you aren't one for tap water.   It really is worth paying extra for executive lounge access, where they provide breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening cocktails (though you have to make your own) within certain times each day, and soft and hot drinks 24/7. The service was outstanding, for example one…",5,August 2018,
Solid Choice,Boekelberg1971,Stayed there for one night on a business trip. E/thing as you expect from a Shangri-La. Pretty large hotel but does not feel like it once you are in your room. Not exactly in the CBD either but short taxi ride is ok. B’fast at club level very good.,5,September 2018,

Outstanding place to stay,cruzin99,"We spent 4 days in Singapore (our first trip) and really did not know what to expect.  We were quite impressed at the nice greeting we got.  We were escorted to the check-in desk, and since we had reserved a club level room we were escorted upstairs to a separate check-in location.  We got to sit down and enjoy complimentary drinks and food (with a great view) while Rachel ( I think that was her name) took care of checking us in.  She also gave us info about some of the things we wanted to do and was very helpful.  The room was very spacious with everything you would need and very clean (same for the bathroom).

Stay a night here early this month while on a staycation with my family, the stay was fantastic and the service was excellent. The guy, Jim who checked us in, was friendly & efficient, and even gave us 2 dine-in credit vouchers for the bar when we asked him about chill-out venue.   We booked the hotel in the early morning, the same day we checked in, and the room was already ready with all our requests, baby cot and connecting rooms the moment we checked in, Bravo to them for the extra details and services.

The only place to stay...,ClaudiMunchiCorn,"As a regular business traveller to Asia, I always try to stay at Shangri-La Hotels (unless I’m in India where it’s Taj or Oberoi). They have a level of customer care missing from the western chains (with the exception of the Four Seasons Group). The Shang in Singapore is a legendary hotel. The recent refurb is welcome and the public areas much improved. I’ve been coming here for 15 years. I’ve also stayed at the Fullerton and Mandarin Oriental but I really wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Singapore if I were you. ",5,September 2018,

Definately Paradise Found,Jo D,"I am lucky enough to be writing this sat within the walls of the marvellous utopia known as The Valley Wing.  Since arriving early Friday morning we have been looked after at a standard not experienced in any five star hotel we have been lucky enough to frequent.  This includes The Ailia Diwa Club Wing in India, The Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong and Chambers at St Pancras in London.  These hotels are at the top of their game but do not come close to the personalised and very attentive service given by every member of staff working in this wonderful environment.

Beautiful welcome.  Check in was smoothest i have ever seen. Aysha was beyond helpful and most welcoming. Aysha welcomed us into our vally wing room 955 which was nothing but I can only describe as vintage elegance. Spacious room. Clean, equally pretty bathroom with a Tv in front of the tub. Perfect way to unwind after a gruelling day of hard core sightseeing.  For breakfast we enjoyed The line. Wow what an culinary experience was that.

Two nights in Singapore at the Shangi la,Daydreamer999,"We had two days in Singapore before embarking on a Cruise around the Far East. We chose the Shangri-La due to our experience in Abu Dhabi where we were wowed by the hotel. I have to say we were a little disappointed with the Singapore hotel I’m afraid to say. On the positive side the hotel itself is lovely, with large spacious rooms and very welcoming staff ( expecially at front desk and conscierge), but some of the things that we loved in the Abu Dhabi Shangri-La were absent.   We booked  a horizon club room and expected to be able to get a snack there when we arrived at about 10pm, but we were advised that the food had finished at 9pm and so we would have to order food in the bar. This turned out to be very loud and rowdy with a live jazz band and many after work drinkers. I…",4,September 2018,

To say we were happy with the hotel is an understatement!! We stayed in interconnecting rooms in the Garden Wing and it was fantastic! The view from the room was amazing, looking over the pool, perfect! The pool was fantastic, much of our 5 day stay was spent beside or in the pool. Breakfast was also a highlight. We had the buffet breakfast a few times and also decided to try the breakfast at the Italian restaurant a couple of times. Wow, we loved it there. Service was impeccable and surrounds were beautiful.

Great business hotel,Lydia-Bali,"As a place for a work trip, this place is excellent.  Easy check-in, quick room service, etc...  Breakfast was of the level you expect at a big hotel like this.  Nice that there were no lines to be seated. Coffee service was efficient.  They even had a little coffee and pastry stand at the entrance for anyone who was in a rush and just wanted to grab and go, which I thought was a nice touch.  They also had a separate area for families with small children - also a great feature.  And there is free wifi everywhere!!!  This is a really great feature if you are moving from one meeting/event to the next.  I was always online so did not need a local sim card.  Rooms were a good size and bed was very comfortable.

Kid-activity weekend,Getassha,"Stayed in the Shang over the Father's Day weekend for a little staycation and decided to check out the new kids' facilities the hotel has. Check-in took a while due to the weekend, and many new guests but staff were helpful to let us know we could check in with the app which helped to speed up the process.  We stayed at the Tower wing and the room was big and very comfortable for the whole family. The bed was very comfy, and I believe the rooms we renovated were recently. The indoor and outdoor Bud play areas for the kids kept my daughter thoroughly entertained when we were in the hotel. The mornings were a little quieter so it was perfect for her to get to play whatever she wanted, a perk of staying in the hotel.

Nice and newly renovated Tower wing room,Rara K,"Stayed 1N in a tower wing club deluxe room for a quick local getaway.  Room is recently renovated with a nice modern touch vs some Shang properties in this part of the world, which is a blast from the 80s. Sound insulation is great and I slept well despite being a light sleeper.  Service is polite, discreet and efficient as is the hallmark of Singapore hospitality, but not as warm and inviting as you would experienced in Shang KL or JKT.  Location is a bit off but there is a shuttle to Orchard mrt station that runs quite frequently. You can walk there too in ~10-15mins (barring bad weather or you have young or old in tow).

Perfect Getaway!,Jeannie Y,"Had a PERFECT experience at Shangri-la, 3 times better than our 2nd-time stay at MBS!  Every thing was great, the excellent service, generous and meticulous in-room amenities, superb ambience (not as crowded and commercialised as MBS) and tremendously worth-while for families!!!  We made several requests and all were acceded to, and even went above and beyond!  I don't know how to better describe such a pleasant, smooth and relaxing stay with my pregnant wife and 2 year-old son.   Impeccable, hugely-underrated (because there are just too many high-end hotels in Singapore) and absolutely recommended by demanding Singaporeans like us!

Great Staycation in a family-oriented hotel,liowheart,"We decided to book a weekend staycation package that included access to Buds, the fantastic indoor playroom and outdoor water playground that Shangri-La decided to install on their premises.   Our daughter had a really good time checking out all the slides and ball pits! Non-stop fun that was well worth the price paid for the package.  Our room was on the family floor which came with a room containing all the amenities that those with babies and young kids need. The room was spacious and came with very useful items for kids and babies. We particularly liked the baby bedroom slippers!

At breakfast, whilst the choice was great, most buffet items which should have been hot on both days were not hot. At most they were warm.

As a regular visitor to the Shangri-La hotel in Singapore, I am accustomed to the excellent service standards provided elsewhere in the hotel and the service in Buds is far from that.  There were a couple of service mishaps where we asked the lady at reception how to get to the outdoor play area and instead of giving us directions she asked us to wait whilst she finished doing something on her computer.

Good executive lounge. Unable to comment on the food/Beverage quality too much as didn't spend much time there. However afternoon tea time scones were excellent as well as other offerings during the one time we were there.  Cons Some mentioned above.

Outstanding.,JeffandNiki,"My husband and I spent 4 nights in a city view room in the Gardem Wing. Check in was friendly and easy. The hotel was beautiful. Our room was so comfortable, spacious and quiet. Staff were always attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. A nice touch was when on my birthday evening I was greeted by a staff member who brought me a beautifully packaged mini cake with a signed card ! Wow, what attention to detail - we never mentioned my birthday. Very touching. The restaurants and pool facilities were excellent. Easy distance to Orchard Rd and easy to get taxis anywhere. We have a membership with Shangri la based on this stay and want to try their hotels around the world as our first choice. Thanks for a wonderful time.",5,August 2018,
Beautiful family hotel,lucyprowe,We had a fantastic stay in the garden wing of the Shangri La.  The rooms are lovely  and the swimming pool and gardens are beautiful .  My children really appreciated the amazing breakfasts especially the donuts. There are a couple of people who deserve a special mention including the lovely lady who makes the eggs at breakfast.  She always has a smile whilst cooking delicious dishes for a number of people at once.  The other person who made a special effort is the lady who took the room service orders who remembered the not only the names of my children but also what combinations of food they ordered!  We have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions over the years and it is now becoming a much more family friendly hotel which we appreciate.,5,August 2018,
Beautiful old hotel but....,ghodlin,"Great facilities  and staff but a lot of issues for a premium priced stay (US$500 per night). Wrong room type, wrong room service food delivered, etc, etc. BUT the BIGGEST issue by far for me was safety. The swimming pool is beautiful and has a kids section. There's a largeadult pool and a small deep pool (2.5 m). This dep pool has no fence or safety around the edge and the path around it is VERY narrrow. If a child fell in and paniced, a  rescue would be very hard given depth. My son is 5 and cannot swim. He nearly fell in when walking past this pool and I saw that the only lofeguard was 30 m away on the other side of the pool, not at the lifeguard post near the deep pool.  This is simply a tragedy waiting to happen. Particularly with parents these dyas distracted by cell…",3,August 2018,
"Pleasant, but ....",SeasideLiving33,"We recently stayed for 12 nights in the Garden Wing of this vast Hotel. Having previously stayed in the Tower wing, a few years back we wanted the use of a balcony this time, & the Garden Wing offers this.  We were welcomed warmly, and taken to our room where we were checked in.  The room was of ample size, well laid out and spacious enough to allow for the extra bed needed for our child. The balcony faced the city, with a pleasant enough view.  Whilst the room was comfortable, it showed signs of age, with too many chipped wood items and just a general feeling of tiredness. This was not helped by the inadequate housekeeping. Often we had no hand towels at all, and the room was barley cleaned. After a long day out, we came back to find the room not cleaned,& then had to request…",3,August 2018,
Wonderful stay,nZed808,"We travelled to Singapore with our three children and had an amazing stay at the Shangri-La. We opted for a family themed room and upon check in were given the space themed room. The kids were blown away as were we! The room was spacious and had a separate room for the kids with a space ship bunk bed that doubled as a play area for them, there was also a little secret tunnel connecting the rooms. The kids had their own ensuite with a kids size toilet and a large bath. They also had their own tv and mini desk with pencils and paper...did I mention the cute mini robes and slippers? Our section of the suite was large with a nice seating area looking out over the pool and the city skyline and a large fridge to keep food and drinks if needed. The service here was exceptional and up…",5,April 2018,
Valley Wing - Genuinely welcomed and duly served.,LANCON13,"32 years ago I spent my honeymoon in a very special hotel in the English lake district. The Lodore Swiss Hotel owned and run by a Swiss family called England. The place oozed quality and professionalism and somewhere I would be happy to return to, my first Shangri-la!.  A lasting impression of 'Service' was embedded in me from that point.  Fast forward to August 2018 and the arrival at the Valley Wing of the Shangri-la Hotel Singapore. Following a short hop down from Bangkok (Shangri-la Krungthep Wing) we arrived for a 2 night stay before our return to the UK.   No sooner had we got out of the taxi we were greeted by the resplendently attired doorman eager to take the luggage before showing us into the entrance lobby, the cool lobby a real contrast to the heat of the outside. …",5,August 2018,
Impressive landscaping,SajidAmit,"Shangri-la Singapore is special in it's landscaping, location and sheer size. It also has a fabulous pool. However, the breakfast at Line was slightly underwhelming (Shangri-la Yangon's breakfast is at least twice as interesting and scrumptious), staff friendliness can ostensibly vary (the lifeguard was grumpy), and they made a mistake with our reservation dates. Overall, just by virtue of size, location and landscaping (it's like a resort smack in the center of Singapore), it gets a 4-star rating. ",4,August 2018,
"EXTREMELY GOOD SERVICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HORIZON LOUNGE CLUB",Ita_Traveller,"Very good hotel, nice rooms, and extremely good service at the horizon lounge club. Breakfast and afternoon breaks are amazing, with such a good quality of food, snacks and good wines. Very good place to visit Singapore.",5,August 2018,
we were staying in the garden wing - fantastic,hiro b,"this is one of the good hotels in singapore... very good views from our garden wing - suite-type, --- the service is good, centrally located on Orchard grove road... all staff members were good - but a middle-aged person -peter from the lobby was very nice- he should be promoted for his proactive guest relations-",4,August 2018,
Excellent Dinner at Diner de Fleurs,Joshua C,"We had a excellent 8 course dinner for 2 prepared by chef Ganesan. The setting was excellent, providing privacy with the occasional sounds of laughter from the pool in the distance. We especially enjoyed the ginger infused buttermilk shooter which was very refreshing; also a very well balanced salmon starter with yuzu and pomegranate, which had great textures. Would highly recommend this experience to all. ",5,August 2018,
Amazing!!! From check in to check out,Natalie R,"Photos truely don't do justice for how beautiful this resort is.  Staff are attentive to all your needs, very welcoming and helpful especially with my many questions being 1st trip here.  So close to shops and hustle of the city.  Kids club is over and above any expectations my child loves baking and they had chef classes for children under 12.  Separate family dining area for breakfast.  Children are at the heart.    We stayed in the gardens rooms very large rooms as the tower wing was sold out free rollaway was placed in the room for us as well.  3 restaurants to dine at for breakfast from quiet intimate dining to busy buffets.  Will be back for a visit I am totally in love with this place!",5,August 2018,
Fun for the family,Ckyeo,"Had a short staycation over a public holiday and despite it being just a 1 night stay, it was fun and memorable. The kids had fun at the indoor playground Buds although we had to pay extra $28 per kid for 3 hours of playtime. They wanted to come back again the following week!  Convenient location for shopping along Orchard Road and lovely restaurants to try as well. The buffet breakfast had a vast spread and was delicious. On the night we were there, the buffet dinner included tropical fruits like durian, mangosteen etc which was a delightful surprise.  All in all, a lovely getaway for the family! ",5,August 2018,
Good hotel but with some issues,Elysian Fields,"The positives are it’s a Shangri-La so good service, comfortable rooms and lovely ambience are normally assured and we weren’t disappointed. We were on honeymoon too and the staff went to great lengths to note the occasion and which we really appreciated.  However, on this 5 day stay we had 3 issues which ultimately prevent a high rating, see below.   1. You now have to make your own cocktails in the Horizon Club! I’m not a cocktail expert so I would have wasted many drinks in trying to get the mix right and therefore didn’t attempt. I was ok with self pour wines and spirits but I was disappointed with the cocktail service omission which we’ve greatly enjoyed before and it spoilt for us what was overall a nice club experience. 2.

Valley Wing Stay,Q513,"We stayed in the Valley Wing for 12 nights with our children ages 1 and 7.   We loved our room which was spacious and elegant in style, the bathroom was huge and the kids loved the TV in the bath.   We enjoyed having access to the lobby lounge all day it was a lovely place to have a coffee or a glass of champagne.  We were conscious that it was quite quiet and not really ideal with a noisy baby so we opted to have breakfast in the Horizon Club on a few occasions which also worked well, but I personally preferred the breakfast in the summit room which was really nice .   We were made to feel welcome with the children but we were conscious that most people staying there weren’t looking for noisy children to ruin the ambience so we made sure we moved somewhere more appropriate if…",5,July 2018,
"Lovely Hotel, an Oasis in the Busy City",DougcpW,"A wonderful in city sanctuary hotel. Like all luxury hotels in this part of Asia, service is first class, facilities are amazing, and rooms are very nice and chock full of amenities. This property is on par with hotels 3x to 5x the price in the USA or Europe. The dinning is particularly good with a vast selection of foods for every nationality. The only down side of this and other hotels of the same caliber in Singapore, such as the Four Seasons and The Regent, is that good and drinks are very very highly priced. Other than that you can’t go wrong. A great place to stay on business travel. And, a wonderful place to stay with the family while entourage to other Asia destinations.",5,August 2018,
"Fantastic hotel, go for the Garden or Valley Wing",AKSchlittenhardt,"I stayed at the Valley wing which is an even more luxurious ""hotel in the hotel"". The service is just perfect, starting from front desk to housekeeping to the butlers in the lobby that serve complimentary drinks and snacks. Definitely my hotel in Singapore.",5,August 2018,
Never disappointed,smilla n,"So this is the third time my family and I have visited this Shangri-La, and it was a delight once again. To begin with, the setting, the property, and the grounds are well kept and dreamily tropical. The balconies spilling over with bougainvillea add a lush feel and the garden rooms (where we stayed again, in a suite) are perfectly decorated with gorgeous hardwood floors and gleaming granite and wood bathrooms. Exceptional amenities and a new kids’ club (immediately proclaimed by both my boys to be The Best Ever!) made our brief stay as wonderful as it could be. Do not go without experiencing the breakfast buffet—representing many varied dishes (Japanese, Chinese, Indian, western), it is a brilliant way to try food beyond of your usual tastes, whatever they may be. I recommend…",5,August 2018,
Online reservation not accurate,roblem1,"This is only a review for the online reservation. I tried to reserve a suite at this hotel on their proprietary online system. There were multiple rooms available at multiple price points. When I filled in all the reservation information it said I needed to call the hotel to book. I called, was placed on hold for a while, and then told there were actually no suites available. As I needed a suite I will stay somewhere else. There is no reason the online system should be so inaccurate- and then waste my time not only going through the system, but having to call and be placed on hold, only to find no rooms available. Although I have stayed here before and it is obviously an excellent hotel, they should avoid the appearance of a ""bait and switch"" tactic, as this online reservation…",2,August 2018,
So good I want to live here,Alex F,"We stayed 3 nights in the Valley Wing. Wow. It was fantastic, the staff were exceptional, friendly, very professional and made the start of our holiday wonderful. We booked a limo from the hotel to pick us up and it made such a difference, get through security into the car and then comfort. The breakfast in the summit room was fabulous, service excellent and the food fantastic. Afternoon tea in the lobby wonderful, we typically went out walking and exploring in the morning so to come back and have lovely tea and cakes was great. Sometimes in life you have to treat yourself to something special, this was it for us and it was better than we ever imagined. We will be coming back.",5,August 2018,
"Our ""Go To"" Singapore hotel",jrAustralia,"Our second short stay holiday at the Shangri La in recent months. Enjoyed it so much the first time we went back for more. Quality of property, excellent swimming pool and surrounding gardens plus friendly and efficient staff all go without saying. This is away from hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd but close enough for a 10 minute walk to be amongst the action. Not the cheapest hotel in town so if you are on a budget it may not be for everyone but feels as though you are at a resort rather than in a busy city. Special thanks to management team member Riccardo , he is on top of his game. Try Garden Room with pool view.",5,August 2018,
Fantastic staff and great ambience,Escape323797,"This is our second stay at the Shangri-la Singapore. We were greeted by friendly staff Jacky at check in, and was upgraded to family suite due to no availability for connecting rooms. The wow factor continues as we came back the next day with a surprise birthday cake awaiting in the room. This made my mom’s day!   The only con is that the hotel is not located right at orchard or mrt. And we had to grab a taxi to look for local eateries. ",4,August 2018,

We are a family of 5 and had interconnecting rooms which was great.  Beds were really, really comfy!",4,July 2018,
Not a couples hotel,Christian G,"I’m writing this review after staying here for 9 nights. The hotel itself is newly renovated, and looks great. The staff is also very service minded and helpful. But this is a resort for families with kids. And this is not something that they promote as clearly as they should. We are staying in a Horizon Club room, with access to the lounge. It should be called the kindergarden lounge. Screaming kids, kids running around. They have a generous period of three hours where you get canapés, wine/beer/cocktails etc. But it is not an environment to enjoy it.   I love the Horizon Club concept. In Dubai it was for adults, table service, etc. Here it is self service, while surrounded with kids. For me, it is not a concept when the difference is that big between two hotels.   I love kids,…",4,August 2018,

Our home away from home!,Lmtjw,"What can I say about the Shangri-la Singapore and more importantly its staff that will do it justice? We have been coming to this hotel and particularly the Valley Wing for several years now and the service is second to none. There is nothing that is too difficult to arrange and the service we receive keeps us coming back.   While my husband and I come to Singapore for business regularly, this was a family trip including our sons 8th birthday. To say the staff went above and beyond is an understatement. There were balloons and a cake in our room on arrival, he had another special lunch arranged for him with another cake and then another celebration on his actual birthday.

Great luxury and comfort.,Kenning K,"Upon arrival we were stunned with how grand the main lobby looked. It was just absolutely breath taking. We had booked a few nights in the garden wing and it did not disappoint. Check-in was a breeze and extremely fast.   The only issue was that the rooms in the Garden were a bit run-down. But I guess that's fairly expected from a building that was built in the 70s. The big plus was that the size of the rooms were fairly big for their price point.   Another thing I must mention and give credit for is the gym. The gym at Shangri-La Singapore has to be definitely one of the best gyms I have seen in a hotel. It had everything you needed from a squat rack, smith machine, dumbbells up to 40kg, and an assortment of machines and cardio equipment. The changing areas were extremely well…",5,July 2018,
Great for kids,rogerlau77,"We had a two night stay here. We arrived in the afternoon but we were told our room would not be ready yet, which was disappointing after it was after check-in time and we had a scheduled appointment. However, this was rectified by the hotel giving us a ‘better’ room and also gave us free drinks for our family at the bar.  We were given a room in the garden wing, which had a balcony outside the room that overlooked the street. Our room was a decent size, large enough to fit a single sofa bed for children. There was sufficient storage space; the usual kettle; an espresso machine and TV.  The bathroom was large enough with separate shower and bath tub. There are plenty of toiletries, although we had to request extra bath towel for the whole family.  We had breakfast at a nice…",4,August 2018,

After checking out early for our flight we arrived at the airport to find our flight had been oversold and we needed to stay another night.

Massive  swimming pool and landscaped gardens.,adi01264,In Nov 2017 I stayed in the Valley Wing in a magnificently furnished large room overlooking the pool and gardens.The checkin occurred in the room.

Family Staycation,n_dlah,Looovvveeee the room! We booked a tower wing deluxe room and it was facing the pool. The room is big and they had a pull out sofa for our 7 year old girl to sleep on. The bed is so comfy and my girl enjoyed bathing in the big bathtub. The best thing is they also have a indoor play area where parents can leave their children and it’s safe cos they have people looking out for the children. Although I would suggest it’s safest for children aged 7-12 years old. The breakfast also has wide range of selections from local flavours.,4,July 2018,

Amazing Stay With Our Two Kids,CJM275,We stayed here for a special two nights after a few night prior at the Shangri-La apartments next door.  From the moment we entered the lobby we were treated wonderfully.  A member of staff came up to us to help us immediately and offered to arrange the transfer of our luggage from the apartments to the main hotel.  They gave my children each a cuddly squirrel toy which went down very well indeed! We were taken up to our Jungle themed family suite and my boys were mesmerized by it.  It should be noted however that it isn't a bunk bed as such - only one kid gets to sleep at the top and the other sleeps in a pull out trundle bed.

We stayed at the Tower Wing this time (last time was a Garden Suite) and the room is fantastic. Simple and elegant, with a king bed fit for 2 adults and a child. Our daughter though opted to sleep on the sofa bed by the bay window, since she loves the view so much, she says. The usual room amenities are present, with a really nice deep soaking tub, (hard to come by in Singapore nowadays) although they could probably provide better toiletries ( guys, even…",5,July 2018,
Short stay but very enjoyable,mrsc2b-11,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights before our trip on the Star Clipper to Bali. It was superb from the food and drink to the friendliness of staff. The room was large with a good sized bathroom, safe, coffee machine and bed was extremely comfortable.Lovely grounds to explore and  a good sized swimming pool.",5,May 2018,
Stop over from Italy to Sydney for 2 nights,Peter A,"Stayed at the Shangri-La Hotel with the Horizon Club option, best decision was to use the Horizon club. The service was excellent, especially the breakfast and cocktails in the evening. Special thanks to  Amir who spent a lot of his time helping and making it fun for his us and all his guests.",5,July 2018,
Valley Wing hard to beat,keyword2016,"On arrival greeted at the entrance by management one with a box of orchids, wisked straight up to our suite with no fuss and from there the super service continued throughout our stay.  Breakfast was without fault with a good range at the buffet (the most delicious yoghurt from Ireland) to the a la carte menu (which included soft boiled eggs with caviar, yum) Dominique and his staff were constantly attentive.  Everywhere you turned at this hotel there was someone waiting to assist you from the pool to the Horizon Club lounge.  Nora (Manager of the Vally Wing was a most charming helpful person always with a smile on her face and an answer to any question). After 5 nights here we didn’t want to leave.",5,July 2018,
Nice Hotel,dmodernmarcopolo,"Had a 2 night stay here and it was a nice Hotel, the room could of been better though, was a bit basic with not many amenities in there! Stayed in nicer rooms to be honest. Downstairs though is a different story, it is really nice and we fully enjoyed being well looked after, couldn’t fault the quality of the food either. Great hotel for a short stay!",4,December 2017,
Visited for our honeymoon - treated like royalty,allypallytarry,We had a wonderful stay at The Valley Wing on our honeymoon. The staff were all exceptional and treated us like royalty throughout our stay. When booking in the Valley Wing you also get access to a complimentary champagne bar - a great perk!,5,August 2017,
As usual!,E-pucc,"A great hotel, apparently the best in Singapore!  Compared to the service, prices are well affordablei do suggest to take the horizon option with the access to the great lounge there!  Since my last stay, some little details has charged. No more slippers or cold towels in the sauna... At the breakfast the hot beverage are now with automatic machines...   But still a great hotel!",5,July 2018,
Excellent stay,CJKX,"Service was top notched from arrival to departure.Rooms are clean, spacious and beautifully renovated.Breakfast, lunch & dinner at The line is always amazing.This hotel is of high standard and you will never get disappointed with what you paid for. It was a lovely way of ending our 10 years stay in Singapore and would definitely stay in this hotel again.",5,March 2018,
Mix feelings!,Simplylife14,"Another return visit and stayed in Garden Wing room, room is spacious and offer resort feel in big city. In general, all were better than last visit from water pressure for shower to general cleanliness. However, hair dryer was so dusty inside and it seems that it never been cleaned. Wonder how clean, it will be when you on this hair dryer. The bathroom amenities like shower gel, shampoo are below standard when comparing with other hotels of same category.  For this particular visit, we were offered to have breakfast at Horizon Lounge. It is a wonderful venue and much more pleasant than The Line (too noisy and busy even with larger choices of food). The food at breakfast were of high quality, very good display and taste good. However, there were only 2 staff who did clearing and…",4,July 2018,
Best Luxury Hotel!,GSK_Pharma,I love Shangri-La hotel as they offer one of the most luxurious rooms I know and the hotel breakfast is definitely one of the very best I enjoy too.  The hotel service is very prompt and efficient with amenities request especially I will like to thank the housekeeping department who does a very good job helping me on it.  Definitely recommend people and visitors who enjoy staying near the shopping district area(5-10 mins drive to Orchard Road)and yet enjoy a tranquil environment.  Simply one of the best hotels in Singapore!,5,September 2017,

I went online and book 3 nights in shangri-la hotel , singapore  Price was not cheap but fair compare to same category hotels . In pictures hotel were very appealing as far as amenities  its offer .

Amazing for families,gahalb,"Exceptional rooms and an amazing set of facilities, particularly for families. Nice swimming pool with a dry and wet play area for kids. The Buds kids club is also fantastic for younger children.  Some slight negatives would be the aging wet area in the fitness centre. Nothing wrong with it all, includes a hot pool, sauna and steam room with extensive changing facilities. But it is starting to look a bit old and worn in places.  The other slight negative is that the hotel seemed very busy, and less personal to when we last visited. We were there about 8 years ago and things seemed more friendly and personal then, whereas we felt like we were just being processed in a very busy hotel on this occasion.  However, still a great place that I would return to.",4,June 2018,
Fantastic as usual,miosto,"This time I stayed in the Tower Wing. The rooms are rather small especially compared to the Garden Wing but they have seen a make over. Also, if you book the exec lounge it is better accessible. The rooms are equipped well, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom offers all necessary things. The lounge serves good breakfeast and evening cocktail and snacks. The gym is probably one of the best in Singapore. Certainly, there are cheaper hotels, but Shangri-La has a good value for money.",5,July 2018,
The hotel does have some good staff,jamesboxhead,"Hi must admit... this review would have been a lot lower if it were not for 2 staff; the doorman & assistant front of house manger the replied to my concerns.  My experiences at the Shanghai-La in Sydney have always been great, but the hotel in Singapore was terrible.  So why a 4 star “Very good” rating... because of the ... final two touch points from the hotel  were “Very Good”.  Let me explain, the doorman who was fetching our final taxi for us was the only person in the last two days that showed any empathy, he apologised provided great service  and made the whole family feel a little better, thank you.  The last touchpoint was from the response from a email complaint I followed up with citing all the issues.  This email  was also dealt with quickly and sincerely and I thank…",4,July 2018,
2 night stop over,irshaadsayed,"We’ve stayed at the Shangri La before but this is the first time we stay on the 9th floor of the new wing. The 9th floor is specifically for family’s. The adjoining room for the children is great, they have everything you need including washing machine and dryer in a specialised pantry. The hotel is super kid friendly, they have a massive indoor play area in the basement and it’s free if you stay on the 9th floor. They also have a great outdoor water play area.",4,June 2018,
Shangri-la,fendrick32,The Shangri-la is best hotel in the city. The check in and check out process is good the rooms is big and bed was comfortable to sleep.  Breakfast spreads are awesome  The staff is very attentive  I truly come again  Thank you Shangri-la for a greatest experience,5,July 2018,
Probably the best hotel experience I have ever had - thanks to the staff,Daniel C,My wife and I and 2 of our children stayed in the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La. The rooms of course were lovely and spacious but the thing that made this so really special was the staff. The level of service was exceptional by all. But it is more than that. The friendliness and care that was displayed was amazing and by the end I was wanting to plan another trip to Singapore so I can stay at this hotel and see everyone again!!!  The Valley Wing is a throw back to a different era of travel and a wonderful one. Don't stay anywhere else in this city.,5,July 2018,
"Perfect, simply perfect!",Graham H,"This place has everything! The staff are always on high alert, and they have thought of everything. We stayed in Garden Wing - huge rooms, and Tower Wing - smaller rooms but great design. We were late booking and they told us we’d have to move rooms, which was fine by us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and wish we could stay longer! We took the room only package, but the breakfast buffet looked awesome! The pool is extensive, and has life guards on duty all day. There seem to be plenty of beds and towels! The lobby bar is relaxed, with live music! We couldn’t find anything to fault anywhere.",5,July 2018,
First Class Everything,Michael Deeb,Great hotel with tasteful bigger than average rooms and first class service all the way from the minute you step down on the red carpet that greets you at the entrance and throughout your stay. Try the buffet at the Line restaurant- great variety of international cuisine. If one was to nit pick I would point out that the location while central getting to the nearest shop is a 10 to 15 minutes walk,5,June 2018,
"A good looking hotel in lush gardens, with a pricey tarrif.",ngow2018,"We stayed at the hotel for four days and found it a very convenient stopping off place.  The staff are universally very friendly and helpful and the hotel looks great and has lush gardens and a nice pool area.  The bedrooms are also nice (but our bed was as hard as a slab of Aberdeen granite). The main restaurant (""The Line"") has a massive breakfast menu reflecting the cultural diversity of the country.  You can dine buffet-style in Malay, Chinese, Indian or western, and everything is tasty.  But beware - when they say breakfast is served until 10:30, that means if you turn up at 10:25 everything has been removed bar a piece of toast! In the evening they serve a variety of dining fares that can be as much as $98 / head. You can take taxis to and from Chinatown, eat there for…",4,July 2018,
Late check in time,1LittleMsTraveller,"Amazing amenities. However we got frustrated upon check in. There was along line in the front desk. We waited for our turn for 30 minutes. And when it was my turn to check in, they said that we still have to wait because the rooms were not yet ready.  They said it politely but was quire dissapointed because it was already 4 pm. We Waited again for 30 more minutes.  When i requested for a late check out (just an additional 1 hour) to compensate their late checkin i was declined. I asked again and they refused again. For the 5th time or 6th time they said yes but only 30 minutes extenson.",3,July 2018,

Lost its spark?,Razvan2013,"This is second time in few month I have stayed in Shangri-la and my experience was not so great like last time. Last time I awarded to 5* now I cannot get on that level. Maybe is a singulare experience but... I have stayed 3 nights including the weekend. Hotel is great and location is perfect but this time service was not at level expected for price you pay for. At check in I waited about half hour to reach the desk. Seems some events, wedding were in place so very busy period. But only 2 desk open out of 4. Then I was inform that I have to wait for my room even was afternoon time. Not exactly time was given. I wait about one hour and a half. Nothing happen.

Very good,PAC2207," Stayed for three nights on business. All very good. Made use of the gym which was quite spacious. Breakfast there was a lot of choice/ok, coffee machine was great I had the buffet dinner one night and managed to try several dishes. Staff were awesome and seemed liked they really cared/high level of service. Lobby was nicely decorated . Did not use the lobby bar but looked good. I did use the pool and had a wander around the gardens. I would go back. ",5,July 2018,
Good but could be great!,rajarshipanigrahi,"Writing this review sitting in Shangrila hotel bed. Hotel seems to be largely catering to tours, events and families. It's a large family oriented Hotel on prime orchard road. Hotel is luxurious, thoughtful, with a decent mix of dated n modern flavour. Rooms are ok , with a separate nice view of the pool or the skyline. Breakfast was crowded and extremely busy during weekends may be. Good variety of food from different cuisine. My only negative is staff. They don't communicate clearly, don't wish you. Very very business like attitude. Could be more personal which gives a nice touch. ",4,July 2018,
Wonderful first stay at the Shangri-la,Juz_az,"We booked a couple of rooms at the tower wing for a birthday celebration and was completely blown away by the level of hospitality and service provided. I liaised with Ms Foo via email, who was ever so prompt at replying and helped to arrange for the reservation. Alex at the front desk during check in must be mentioned as well. She gave us such a warm welcome and was so personable.   We had 2 tower deluxe rooms, 1 family deluxe room and 1 junior suite. The family deluxe room came with a little daybed by the window which the kids adore and love sitting at to admire the view outside. It was really comfortable too. Although they were initially disappointed that it didn't come with a bathtub (I was secretly relieved as that means I won't have to spend so much time preparing a bubble…",5,July 2018,
Great Centrally-located Hotel for Family,Jason,"Hotel is located in a quiet and high-end residential area which is a 5-min walk from the main fanfare of Orchard Road. And it's very centrally located so you feel like you are right in the middle of town.   Hotel is perfect for families with almost an entire level dedicated to children, with a huge playroom facilities, complete with regularly held baking class - note even for hotel guests you have to pay to use the playroom and of course weekend baking class and on weekends you will be competing with what looks like many resident families who have come to use the facilities, so it does get busy. The hotel also has a great free-form pool and a water park and playground for children, which my 3-year old enjoyed greatly.   We stayed at the Tower Wing and the rooms are just…",5,July 2018,
Great hotel,gurm1962,"We stayed at the Shangri-La hotel for seven nights on our first holiday to Singapore. It was very nice, modern hotel with excellent facilities. It was a gentle 10 minute stroll to Orchard Road and around 15 minutes by taxi to get to the marina area, so was a very handy base from which to explore the city. I would certainly recommend a stay there.",5,July 2018,
I want to Live in The Valley Wing,66BJF,What can you say exceptional from start to finish.   We stayed in The Valley wing and where you can choose complimentary Veuve Cliquot Champagne and a selection of extremely good wines all within your Room price. Couple this with afternoon tea and evening Hor‘s D’ouevres and it’s a winning combination.   Staff are excellent and go out of their way to help 10/10.  This was our second visit and will be our first port of call for futures stays in Singapore.,5,April 2018,

"Truly 5 Star hotel, excellent service and location",travelathon123,Celebrated my birthday by staying at the shangrila orange grove.  What a beautiful grand and elegant hotel.  Top class service.  We arrived very early and upgraded to the garden wing with pool views.  What a beautiful large room with sitting area and balcony.  From reception staff to room staff everyone was so polite.  Nespresso coffee in room was excellent and the pineapple tarts treat was yum.  Our 3 year old received a soft toy squirrel as we checked in which was such a sweet touch.  The pool was excellent clean and tidy.  Raymond the pool attendant was a joy.  Having worked here for forty years he was still smiling which means a lot.  When people left the pool he removed towels which meant no hogging of pool chairs and the area looked top class.  Great employee.  All good…,5,June 2018,
5 star hotel with 5 star service,Ken crow,"The device at the Shangri-la is first class and the amenities match that. My only issue was the breakfast arrangements,although there is an excellent choice of food the area is like eating in a airport, too noisy with children running about. There is always a que for coffee as the machines are constantly breaking down.overall it's a really good place to stay.",5,July 2018,
Amazing Valley Wing,Stephen D,"Just spectacular. 4 amazing nights staying in this hotel in a wonderful country. Where to start. Picked up at the airport by the hotel limo. On arrival at the hotel offered a drink and a relax in the champagne bar before being escorted to our luxury room.  Every staff member we came across were wonderful. Especially Khyria (hope spelling is correct) in the champagne bar who looked after us exceptionally, especially when we returned tired from our excursions. Had breakfast in the Summit Room and the Line bar. Both superb but very different. Summit Room more formal and private. Line bar is a help yourself buffet with tremendous variety. Swimming pool area is superb. Great to have a swim and relax with a book able to have a drink from the poolside bar. Had dinner one night at the…",5,July 2018,
3 nights stay,Pendle67,Arrived late evening after flight from Borneo. Had booked a room in the horizon club. Lovely surprise when booking in as we was upgraded to a tower wing room. Used the horizon club for breakfast afternoon tea and the cocktail hour. Lovely to relax after day sightseeing in very hot and humid conditions. As in all Shangri la hotels we have stayed in staff  lovely and helpful. Would definitely stay here again wish had stayed longer than 3 nights as so much to see and do or relax round the fantastic pool and well kept gardens.  Many thanks to all staff at all 3 Shangri la hotels we stayed.  Amazing.,5,June 2018,
Excellent Staycation at Shangri-lah Garden Wing,Peggy T,"Wonderful choice for tourist, traveller or even anyone on staycation. We bought a promotion package and had an enjoable time at Shangri-lah Hotel. Located at Orchard and along Orange Grove Road, it has an excellent location - away from the busy main Orchard Road and yet short walking distance to shopping centres, etc. We chose the Garden Wing as there is a good children water and physical playround apart from the beautiful swimming pool, water features, indoor waterfall, gardens and The Orchid. It surely has nice restaurant with spread of local delicacies, Chinese Tim Sum, Malay Roti Prata, Indian spicy cusine and International Breakfast. There are numerous artistic pieces for your admiration too. Good place for individual and family. Check out the exercise program at the gym…",5,July 2018,
An amazing hotel for families vacation,Sunija,"The best hotel to stay in Singapore for family vacations.  Spacious rooms, elegant decor, beautiful and lush green grounds and a play area thats a huge hit with kids.  Breakfast spread at The Line restaurant was excellent.  A special thank you to Khagendra Nayak for the excellent and authentic Indian cuisine experience. Traveling as a big group he ensured we didn't missed home cooked food at all.  Would highly recommend Shangri-La to others.",5,June 2018,
"Good, but not for me",Roger A,"This hotel is situated out near the shopping area of Orchard Road. It is a very big hotel with three towers situated around a central lobby, restaurant/bar area. We stayed in the Garden Wing, which has a beautiful central area which is like a tropical forest with a walkway running through it down to the pool area. Our room was large and well equipped with a balcony overlooking the very impressive pool. Service was great in the hotel, although service in the restaurants and bar was disappointing in our experience. But although the hotel has a lot to recommend it, I wouldn't I stay there again for three main reasons. First, the room floors are hardwood rather than carpeted and so you can clearly hear people walking about in the room above. Being woken up at 6 am each morning by…",4,June 2018,
Dissapointung,FannyBrice,"Not the Standard i am used to. Upon check in they didnt have my golden circle number and couldn't find it. Though I stayed in Manila many time and they always find it. I even told them I stayed there a month ago, but they still could not find it.   Then the room service... A sgd 42 burger came in a plastic tray, covered with clear plastic foil. Economy class food on a plane looks more attractive than that",2,June 2018,
Comfortable Stay,carl360360,"Spend a week here at Shangri-La Singapore for business. This place is spectacular for stay, for its luxurious and homely feel. No wonder this place was always choosen for important events.  Had a little confusion over my reservation although I stayed here few times before. But that was resolved pretty quickly. I would say the best part of my stay here is the cleanliness of the entire hotel. Being very particular with cleanliness, this is why I appreciate my company for choosing this hotel among others. Bed is very comfortable that you can be sure of a good night sleep.   The hotel is just 30 minutes away by taxi from the airport and stone throw away from the shopping belt.

Valley Wing - What is there not to like?,fivestarandabove,"As I walked into the Valley Wing Lobby after almost 2 years due to change in business travel, I felt I have finally arrived home.  It is so comfortable to see the familiar faces of Swaran, Edward, Raja and Hussein at the lobby. They all came forward and greeted me with genuine warmth and I could feel they are really happy to see me again!  It is like coming home to my family whom I haven’t seen for 2 years...it brought tears to my eyes. A glass of champagne was handed to me to welcome me back as I was checking in. Kahlil was off on the day I arrived,  when he saw me the next day, he smiled with glee and handed me a glass of champagne before I even ask for it!

Conference and mini break,RainysHolidays,Stayed at the Shangrila Hotel for 5 nights - mostly for a work conference using both the ballroom and the conference rooms on level 4.   Staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  I had heard about the breakfast at this hotel but it really was something to behold.   Anything and everything you could imagine were laid out for you to choose for your breakfast.  Service was cheerful and fast.  Rooms were well appointed and very comfortable.,4,June 2018,
lovely hotel but not ideal location for young family,melanie111,"This was a lovely hotel. We picked it as the standard size room could accommodate my family of 4. One child slept on a pull out bed and one on the sofa. Room worked out great.  However location wasn't ideal for young children if planning to use the subway as it was a good 20 minute walk (with 3 year old) to Orchard station. After a couple of days we gave up and took taxis. There was an hourly shuttle bus to the station, but it was tiny and unless we were at the front of the queue stood no chance of getting on.  Breakfast was very good but very crowded and out of 4 mornings we were not once able to get orange juice as it kept running out.  Lovely pool and grounds.",4,April 2018,
A return visit after 5 years,medgor,"Decided to have a 2 nights staycation with my family after reading about the new family themed suites.  My family has been heading to the sister property in Sentosa all these years for staycations especially with kids as they loved the kids friendly amenities and facilities there.  I decided to try the Shang's new family themed suite after reading about them.  There are 5 of such suites.  It can easily accomodate family of 5!  My kids were thrilled to the max with the room!  A nice looking submarine bunk bed is in our suite together with a king size bed in the other room located within the suite. Thus it's considered a 2 bedroom suite I'll say each is ensuite.

Beautiful Hotel,Theresa T,"We went to Singapore for our 25th Anniversary and stayed in the Valley Wing at the Shangri-La Hotel and wasn't dissapointed. It is the most beautiful relaxing hotel with orchids everywhere. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, the staff are friendly and welcoming and can't do enough to make your stay special. We didn't try any of the restaurants there but really enjoyed the canapes. The breakfast was wonderful with varied things to eat you could have whatever you wanted and on saying that I would think the restaurant's food would be just as excellent.

Another superb hotel by Shangri-La,Fareed Suliman Dindar,"One would never say the buildings are over 50 years old. The architecture and decor are fresh and inviting. Maintenance levels are remarkable. We stayed in the Valley Wing section of the hotel and the room amenities were superb. The bedside pedastal provided as usual a bible and refreshing the teachings of Budda however a copy of the Quran was missed.  My wife developed a reaction to the jasmin fragranced bath soaps and housekeeping without question immediately replaced with an alternate fragrance.  Of note on checking-in the gentleman at the front desk Mr Yong Long was quick in upselling us to the better appointed Horizon Club package. Will I return to the hotel, a resounding ...Yes!",5,June 2018,
Drank a can of tonic water already EXPIRED in Valley Wing!,bowiehelen,"Stayed 3 nights (21-May check-in) in their Valley Wing which is supposed to be the best among the 3 Wings.  Conclusion: I would certainly look around other hotels the next time I visited Singapore.  This review is long as I mentioned both pros and cons in different areas.  For the expired drink, I reported to the front desk manager when I checked out on 24-May and provided him my room number. He promised to file my case, so I wonder why there was no response from the hotel.  The room is spacious and classic although some decor a bit dated. Bed and pillow are very very comfortable.  Nespresso, branded toiletry, turndown service were all good. Air-cond was too cold although I adjusted to 25 degree.  Services in general was of very high quality especially Raja in the Valley Wing…",2,May 2018,

Utterly disappointing,smth78,"What a disappointing experience we had over the holiday weekend at Shangri la Singapore. The bad experience started from check in where it took 1 and half hours for us to get our room. The excuse was they were experiencing high volume of customers. If that’s the case, they should realistically manage the customers’ expectations upfront and informed us ahead of time of this delay. When we checked in, we were informed that normal check in time is 3pm and it was already 245pm so we did not expect a long wait. This didn’t help when after multiple reminders (I was told 30 mins each time I enquired) were we only given our keys. They were not too apologetic about the delay either and just put the blame on housekeeping.  What made things worse was they then lost our bags and placed the…",1,June 2018,
Absolutely amazing,Barbara F,"We stayed here for a week at the end of our stay in Asia. The hotel is amazing and more. We stayed in the valley wing, it was a vacation to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday and our silver wedding anniversary. The staff and hotel went over and above to make our stay special. We had a celebration cake presented on our anniversary in the lounge by Raga and he made us feel so special. The quality of service is outstanding.  Breakfast in the senate room is lovely. The staff are really attentive, and even though the hotel and staff were in the process of potentially preparing for the stay of president of the America and South Korea’s head our service was hardly effected at all. They did have to move our room on the day before departure, but hey they made it so easy and went the…",5,May 2018,
Fantastic hotel,LA_ubi_10,"The place is just beautiful! Nice foyer when you arrive, very nice room (heard some are not yet renovated though), the pool is very nice and the pool bar even better in the evening. Breakfast just amazing, very broad range of food - I actually loved the coffee place that is part of the breakfast buffet. The service overall is just totally outstanding!",5,February 2018,
"Pretty hotel, but not centrally located",Michelle B,"I stayed at the Shangri-La on the tail end of a business trip. The service was pretty good in the hotel, but the room was lack luster for the price.  Old, outdated and not very clean.  Other drawback was the location, it is outside of the central business district and not very convenient for walking into town. This appears to be a place for families given all the amenities for kids, so it might be on point for that. Seems overpriced for the condition of the room.",3,June 2018,
Super nice hotel,Shubhro Mitra,"Shangri-La is well known hotel chain and the Singapore hotel after twin renovation of it's garden wing and main tower has made the hotel look new again. It has three main wings and also the large service apartments and also the short / long stay apartments. The full complex is very large and has all the amenities. It is also well located just off Orchard road. All the restaurants like the Japanese, Shang Place (Chinese) the Italian one are great places to dine in but on the expensive side. The Chi Spa is fantastic and the pool is just great. Lovely property and great staff but the in room dining may take time to get the food orders.",5,October 2017,
Superb Hotel,John F,"Great location and a top class hotel.  Has been great for past 20 years.  Excellent staff and great service.  Rooms are very well appointed and very quick response to any requests for laundry or help of any type.  Pool area is a real tropical resort.  Great for business or leisure breaks,  highly recommend as one of the best hotels in Singapore",5,June 2018,

Great for Staycation,ArnelCB_Singapore,"This luxurious hotel is great for staycation. The hotel is great inside and out, from lobby, to its restaurants, to the pool and its amenities, to inside the room. Lobby is very big and cozy. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from and breakfast is great, by the way, with different types of food to choose from. The pool is very big with kiddie pools connecting with the main so it is easy to switch from one pool to the other. The room is very spacious, very modern and techie with usb plugs for charging devices are plenty and available.  Oh yes, there is a playground for kids at the lower lobby that has a big discount for hotel guests.    Great great place for staycation. Perfect for family and business trips as well. Will be back again soon.",5,June 2018,

No Hotel for business people or couples - more like a kindergarten,dagGothenburg_Sweden,"This was my worst hotel experience for a very long time. I think the Hotel wants to be a family Hotel. This means that if you do not want to have screaming children around you all the time, do never come here. Service also poor and breakfast experience was horrible. Even the horizon lounge so full that we could not get a table. Juices in bottles and coffee from machines which tasted so bad that we had to walk to Starbucks to get a decent cup of coffee. Very disappointing experience and never ever again. Compared with other luxury hotels in Singapore (St Regis, Fullerton, Raffles) a really poor experience. Staff let’s children scream and run around and bother other guests. Spoke to a Berman couple who decided to check out and find another hotel.",1,June 2018,
One of the best luxurious hotel,h2783,"My previous stay at a deluxe room was awesome. This time, I was provided with a standard room, which was also good. Service is great, even though check in before 3pm can be challenging if not inform beforehand, but the hotel provides good amenities for the guest to enjoy while waiting. The Line restaurant was among the best Hotel Buffett in Singapore, even better than the choices offered by the Fullerton Hotel.",5,June 2018,
Staff makes the hotel stay wonderful,bralec2,"When I checked in, Alex Lee walked me to my Valley tower and welcomed me with excellent service and warm greetings.  Valley tower lobby is led by Edward Chew (Lobby Ambassador) and he takes time to know his guests.  He is assisted by Jade Han, Khair Kasam and Sara.  The room was perfect.  Enjoy your time and this hotel offers plenty of service.",5,June 2018,
Lobby Lounge,David1366,"Spent several evenings in the Lobby Lounge during my stay in Singapore. Excellent service and entertainment.

Wonderful repertoire and all requests accommodated. Very enjoyable and top quality performances greatly appreciated by the guests.  Will certainly return.",5,May 2018,
Lovely hotel,Steph,"Stayed here from 18th -20th May. The hotel is rather pricey but it is lush, massive pool, massive rooms, air con etc. It’s everything you would expect from a Shangri-La hotel.

Wonderful hotel,Dewhirst040710,"Just spent 3 nights at this superb hotel and can’t fault anything about our stay. The room was luxurious, on the small side, but perfect if you needed to work, as it had a large fully equipped desk. We choose the Tower wing as we wanted to experience the Horizon club facilities and we weren’t disappointed. All the staff there were very attentive and the breakfasts, afternoon teas and canapés were lovely. I’m still missing the cocktails, they made a perfect Singapore sling. The gardens were beautiful, the pool was warm and the loungers and towels were readily available. The Shang palace restaurant was also wonderful, the food scrumptious and the staff, especially the manager on duty Wednesday 6th June was very obliging, many thanks, the swans were very tasty.

Heaven for all families with kids!,Danieltravelus,"You have children and plan to travel to Singapore? Shangri-La is the place to be! The past years I had the chance to stay in almost all 5 star hotels in Singapore... yet Shangri-La is playing in its own league:  Check-In: Fast, efficient and still very personal... we’ve been guided all the way from the taxi, to the check-in counter and from there to the elevator. When we arrived in our room the luggage was already there. I wished it would be like this in all hotels!  The room / kids floor: Truth been told - the decor is not my cup of tea... to put it into positive words “very classic”.

It is well appointed for a wide range of events, from weddings to conferences. Their many F&B outlets provide a selection of good quality food. The main entrance is located on elevated grounds, which gives this hotel an impressive site, close to Orchard Road. You can relax over drinks in the lobby, listening to live singing and music. A great place for entertainment at different levels.",4,June 2018,
The Valley Wing - Magnificent,Birt1964,Oh where to start? On this visit to Singapore we decided to splurge and stay at the Shangri-La. Not in the everyday person Tower Wing but in the very special person Valley Wing. It is special indeed! Yes there are dress standards but that is only appropriate when there are special drinks including Veuve Cliquot flowing from 11:00 - 22:30 in the lounge. There is high tea & snacks &  reading glasses to go with the newspapers & very attentive staff in fancy dress. Our room was superb and the daily breakfast in the Summit Room was a delightful way to start the day. A delight that could only be improved if they served bubbly wine. And the pool and the complimentary massages were the best!,5,May 2018,
Ball room experience,doritg888,"We had our high school graduation ball there yesterday. Everything was fine but I admit I am utterly disappointed when a 5 Star hotel is unable to serve one table at the time. I had at least 4 times to call the waiter to show him That food was still missing but they a started already the next table. Sorry Shangri la, I would have expected much better from you .",3,June 2018,
Requires improvement in Customer Service and Quality of Food,jelinc2016,"Stayed in the newly renovated Tower Wing Suite which is to 5 stars standard. However everything else falls short of expectations. Check in staff did not brief benefits of the stay and what was included, and was standoffish. Children’s amenities were requested during booking and check in but was not there- I understand that room booked was not a family room as it was too small for us, however , hotels like Ritz Carlton will prepare stuff for kids regardless of room or package booked as part of Ritz Kids program. Shangri-La tries to be a family friendly hotel but fails even in this simple gesture. The food quality in the hotel has dropped tremendously. Room service was awful, food at The Line, the Horizon Club and Shang Palace was equally bad. For such high prices, the food…",2,June 2018,
Fabulous stay,Vicky A,"I'd just like to thank the staff at the Shangri-la, Singapore for a fabulous short stay.

Great hotel in a great location -close to Orchard rd and shopping district,Anne P,"First time visitors to Singapore and we were not disappointed. Stayed 4 nights at the end of May 2018. We found it very easy to check in at the Shangri-La. On arrival, we were warmly greeted and provided with some fresh juice -it was an easy process and they called my husband from the room (at my request) to come and meet in the lobby.  The room was as expected. Very comfortable and air-conditioned. I loved the toiletries. I had forgotten my toothbrush and was very pleased to find that there were toothbrushes and toothpaste in the toiletries included in the bathroom. So that is a big tick from me!

Luxury Oasis in Singapore,522serapk,"Shangri-La Hotel is a luxury oasis from the moment you enter the breathtaking lobby.

The staff were very friendly and helpful upon check in and with some requests we had. The room we had was nicely decorated, big and had all the amenities. We stayed in a double bedroom and the sofa in the room turned into a bed for our baby. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The bathroom was nice too. The only small criticism was that the shower could have been more powerful, although it wasn't bad, just a personal preference. The room had a fully stocked mini bar and a draw full of goodies! We had a pool view room which was a nice touch. The pool was very nice and had sections for the kids. My wife had a massage here and she enjoyed it.…",5,May 2018,

I was overwhelmed to be greeted by my favourite Italian Chef and Grace my favourite hostess. It was a surprise for me because these two lovable people are supposable on vacation but when they checked the reservation list they realised that I would be present on 28th May. Both of them cancelled their vacation to serve me. Ooh they really do me proud! Grace even posed a picture with me during the dinner. So sweet of her. I truly enjoyed myself that evening eating all the sumptuous food from appetiser to main course, finishing with desserts, not forgetting gelato icecreams.

An excellent staycation for my wife's birthday!,adrianloh,"We stayed 2D1N at this hotel for my wife's birthday and it turned out to be a wonderful weekend, partly due to the fact that we were upgraded to a Garden Wing suite! We managed to pack quite a lot in for the weekend - from lunch at the Waterfall restaurant (which was delicious as usual) to the always excellent buffet dinner at The Line, not to mention my kids running havoc in the hotel's amazing kids club.   Our rate entitled our kids to use the kids club for free and I can see why so many people were there - it's large and well equipped for kids to expend all their energy climbing, running, sliding, throwing, chasing and basically running wild. On top of this, our kids also did a cookie baking class which cost extra.  The rooms were well appointed and spotless so absolutely no…",5,March 2018,

Andreano has created a restaurant which understands food from planting, growing, nurturing, harvesting, presenting and service. It is part of his family tradition because they are sommeliers, they are chefs, they grow olives and farm fresh vegetables. We have had Sunday lunch and weekday meals and dinners there many times over the years. We’ve had the most amazing family meal in their discrete private dining room with a very homely atmosphere.

From the point of out check in, throughout the stay the experience has been anything but fantastic.  The reception team (Shawn) specifically asked if we were here for an occasion, just so they can find ways to make our stay more memorable.  The house-keeping Team is very detailed, they changed out soiled towels when they turned down the beds.  The concierge (RajKumar) was always ready to render help, in any way possible. No restrictions on the number of times I could enter and exit the carpark.  The gym staff were always on the lookout to clean the equipment once they were used and serving you with a smile.  Excellent amenities for the kids too!  All in all, exquisite experience. No wonder they are probably the…",5,May 2018,

The Tower Wing is where the main entrance to the hotel (and I believe, there are some banquet halls as well) and we found that to be bustling and noisy, with a lot of hotel and outside guests milling around. By contrast, there is a separate lounge and sit down area for the Valley Wing which was nice and quiet. We were on vacation and the unhurried pace was exactly what we wanted!!

The Valley Wing is very pleasant and the service at the champagne bar is very courteous and fast. Outside there are also nice tables where you can have breakfast. There, however, the service during breakfast is extremely incompetent and actually does not exist.  The women prefer to stand around in the air-conditioned room and do everything they can to avoid the heat. The service outside was a big disappointment! Also the choice at breakfast is extremely small and it takes a long time until something is served. I recommend having breakfast at Restaurant the Line.

Five Nights at the Shangri-La Singapore,Geoffrey A,"We chose this hotel because we wanted a resort style hotel in a location close to Orchard Road. So first to the problems we encountered. Several months prior we booked and paid for five nights in a Pool View room. On our arrival at check in we were told our room was not available for the first night due to overbooking. Staff told us they would put us in a Valley View room for one night then move us the next day. This was very inconvenient and stressful as it necessitated unpacking, repacking, moving then unpacking again. All very stressful as we only had five nights for a mini holiday. We were given a credit on our room account as compensation for the inconvenience. Still it shouldn't have happened in the first place.

Its just off the bustling Orchard Road (within walking distance) but encompassed in green noise free area and surrounded mostly by residential buildings. The check in at the horizon club lounge was smooth. The rooms are spacious but a bit small when compared with other five star properties. The service is impeccable as a norm with all Shangri La hotels. The buffet at breakfast was sumptuous but had specific problems at the Indian Vegetarian menu. This was pointed out to the chef, who immediately noted down the suggestions and promised for a rectification.

Lovely resort but a little busy,TDT,"I stayed recently for a weekend during a business trip.  I have stayed previously so knew what to expect.  The location is great for Orchard Road, Dempsey etc and the hotel has a true resort feel.  It has a great pool area and the spa is very nice, although it lacks any on site facilities (its treatment only - no saunas, steam etc, though they have this in the fitness centre, a short walk away).  The Shang Palace is great for Chinese food, although the service was a bit lacking.  The room was great - spacious and well decorated and clean (save for some mould on my duvet, but the hotel were very apologetic and dealt with it well).  Staff were very friendly.

Hospitality from the core,Vidyut Lokur,"I've stayed at a few Shangri-La's and I can positively say that this is one of the few brands that is truly hospitable - and not just at the face of it. The hotel is enormous, the way a five star should be - probably because it is a relatively old hotel and not your typical high rise. Though old, the refurbishment has been top notch and there is nothing that suggested the hotel's age.  The pool is huge and so is the buffet - right next door so feasting after a dip seems justified.

When checking in after two long flights across many times zones, I initially wasn't too pleased to hear that our reserved rooms in the garden wing were not available, and that we were to be moved to the tower wing. While I had never stayed at the tower wing before, my impression was that the rooms are small and I thought they could be dated.  Fortunately, I couldn't have been more wrong.

Exquisite hotel in fabulous Singapore,CoffeeBeanCardiff,Spent 2 days here before setting out on a cruise to Myanmar.  Stunning hotel in extensive gardens with orchids galore - who need to go to the Botanic Gardens with this on display! The room was lovely.  We sank into the bed after a long trip from London non-stop with BA. (which by the way was also surprisingly good).  It oozed luxury and we loved it.  Excellent staff and the customary enhanced level of customer care from the entire team.  Would certainly recommend this hotel.  Free shuttle bus operates to the shopping district with further easy access from there via the metro rail all across the city.  Such a safe place to wander around.  Can't fault a thing about it.,5,March 2018,

Tony our waiter was always available and willing to help with anything we needed but without doubt the reason for this excellent restaurant delivering excellent service and outstanding food is down to he manger Andreano who being Italian understands what people expect.

I took advantage of the complimentary shoe shine service and my shoes were returned that afternoon.   The gym is large and has a wide range of equipment in good condition. The pool area (pictured) is beautiful and allows for a relaxing experience.   Location of the property is likewise good. You're close enough to the Orchard Road high street area (quick 5 minute walk) but removed enough where you feel separated from the hustle and bustle.

ASEAN security took over the hotel for the event and made it a bad experience for guests,Surfweb,"The event that ruined our planned relaxing weekend head of government ASEAN event took of the lobby and every entry point, making guests feel like they were suspects rather than guests. Nice hotel but failed to manage this event and its private guests experience well. Even the swimming pool had security lurking around. If I had know this event was going to be held at the hotel and the subsequent effect it had on my holiday I would not have stayed at this hotel. The hotel failed to inform its guests prior.  The hotel is nice with nice gardens, expensive restaurants and lobby lounge and the cost for a room way over valued. The breakfast restaurant by the pool felt more like a busy café in a shopping centre. I had to wait for 10 minutes to get a table. Then another 10 minutes to…",3,April 2018,
Origin Bar and Grill dining,lawsarita,Thank you to the wait staff and chef Heidi and her team for an incredible 3 course meal at Origin. The meal went from strength to strength. I was overwhelmed along with my friends with the attention to detail. It was great meeting the chef and talking with the staff about Singapore. A restaurant experience not to be missed. Thank you,5,April 2018,
We loved everything,lelisal,"The location is top, the service is excellent, the facilities are really good!! I travelled with my 2 toddlers and we stayed for 3 ninths and had an amazing time. The kids club is really good , the breakfast wowwww. ",5,April 2018,
Amazing hotel,Kate R,"If you are looking for a tropical oasis to stay at when in Singapore then look no further.  This hotel is beautiful, staff are efficient, friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  A good choice of dining options to suit all tastes and budgets.  Beautifully set in 15 acres of manicure tropical gardens- bliss !!",5,May 2018,
Sophisticated elegance but fell short in some places.....,TravelGnomes,"We have become fans of Shangri-la hotels recently and our recent stay here in Singapore did not disappoint in terms of the hotel elegance and sense of refined luxury and service. We stayed in a Tower Wing Horizon Club Grand Premier Room for 4 nights. It was one of the newest renovated rooms on Level 10. The room was beautiful and incredibly spacious, with a separate kitchenette and dining area. The house keeping service was impeccable. The Horizon Club was a real treat and a lovely sanctuary to visit in between our day's activities.  What had let me down were: (1) The Line restaurant was crazy busy and felt out of keeping with the rest of the hotel feel. It felt like a busy food court and our coffee was served with the coffee spilt all over its saucer. I'm willing to oversee…",4,April 2018,
Beautiful Resort Property Close to Shopping!,DiznyGirl,"Capped off a business trip with the husband by staying our last two nights at this resort. The grounds are absolutely beautiful with a picture perfect pool, gardens, and a gorgeous lobby! AND they give you an Orchid on the way to your room :) First and most importantly, EVERY staff person was helpful, friendly and professional-couldn't have asked for better! Our room ( Garden Wing) was large and beautiful with lots of wood trim. The bed was very comfortable and the room had built in night lights. It had a very well stocked honor bar area with wine glasses, wine opener, plate, knife & Nepresso machine. The room had plenty of outlets and USB charging ports.The bathroom was like having my own private spa with a great rain shower-head and soaker tub.  I loved the detail of the small…",5,April 2018,
Perfect stay in Singapore,Elisa D,"I stayed 2 days with my husband at this hotel... everything was impeccable: rooms very spacious with a very nice view, very big pool, personnel very friendly but what I think was the best is definitely the breakfast. ",4,April 2018,
Exceptional service,Louis O,We stayed here for 2 nights and our experience here was excellent. Loved hanging out around the pool and orchid area.   We stayed in the Horizon Club Grand Premiere Room on the first day so we were escorted up to the 24th floor lounge for check in. The lounge is beautiful and conducive to do work at. Check-in staffs were polite and professional. Room is very spacious and the design was very well thought. It is more suited for business travellers than families. It does not have a balcony but it offers a nice view of the city from the day bed and the work desk.   Our 2nd day stay was at the Garden Wing One Bedroom Suite so we had to check out and waited at the lounge before the suite was ready for check in. It is also very spacious and we loved the balcony overlooking the pool.…,5,May 2018,
Started off shakey but finished strong.,sealeg,"Having been to this hotel for decades and having been a regular whilst living in Singapore we decided to return to this hotel for a recent vacation.   Arrived to a foyer in chaotic state and to slow service at the reception. Had booked 6 nights in Horizon Club and was eventually checked in there. We are Golden Circle Members and Platinum Amex and booked under Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program which includes a room upgrade on arrival. Which we initially did not get, although rooms were available.  We were also disappointed with the changes in Horizon Club with a huge number of families with small children with several children not under the control of their parents, running around, two nearly running into me from the same family. Add the downgrading Of Champagne to the cheaper…",5,April 2018,
An end of holiday treat,Gordon T,"Stayed one night in the valley wing, only wish that it could have been more. A superb hotel in every way. Great swimming pool, super rooms, delicious food. The staff were helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. If I should go to Singapore again this is definitely the hotel I would stay in",5,April 2018,
A perfect end to our holiday,Glen,We were fortunate to spend two nights in the 'Valley Wing' of the Shangri-La. The property and the amenities were of the highest standard. The staff were totally professional and hospitable with a particular mention to Vanessa on reception and full marks to Raja who produced a fine 'negroni' cocktail. The breakfast buffet was a delight and the dinner that we enjoyed in the 'Origin Grill' was superb. Without doubt it will be our destination for our next Singapore visit and we would highly recommend the 'Valley Wing' of the Shangri-La to others.,5,April 2018,
Perfect,Rustylou63,"Simply perfect. I genuinely can't fault a single thing about this hotel.  It was the first place we stayed on our honeymoon. The first night, with grand plans of heading out for a lovely meal at a fancy restaurant, we liked it so much we stayed in!  We upgraded to a slightly bigger room and access to the Horizon Club. Definitely worth the money getting access to the club, especially for the drinks and nibbles between 5-7!  It's one of the fanciest places I've stayed, and I'm so glad that every part of the experience with them was flawless.",5,April 2018,
Excellent stay!,edithang,"We decided to stay at Shangri-la to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It was a good stay for the family. My daughter enjoyed herself at BUDS. Only thing is when it got too crowded, the parents were all also standing in the midst of the play area watching their kids and chatting at the same time. Imagining the kids running around with parents standing in the midst of the limited walk area... May be a danger hazard. Other than that, my girl enjoyed herself! The staff at BUDS were really friendly. Kudos to angeline! She remembered my girl even on the second day and she said hi! The bake studio offers free 'moulding' sessions during weekdays for kids to help  Prepare the dough for breakfast. My 4 year old enjoyed it! The room was spacious and clean. They prepared the bed for my girl…",4,April 2018,
Fabulous Hotel and Wonderful Staff (Particularly the Valley Wing),Alan C. Wetherby,"Arrived here on a lovely Friday afternoon from Cambodia for a three day stop-over before returning back to UK. Upgraded to Valley Wing and never regretted it!!! The champagne bar with afternoon tea and evening canapés, wonderful staff who worked tirelessly to ensure your glass was always full and a wonderful lounge to simply relax in and be utterly spoilt. Despite the fact my wife took ill on the Saturday morning, nothing was ever an issue, the constant flow of hot water, lemon and honey to providing a doctor who managed to get her back on her feet after 36hours was a testament to the levels of service they provide and the standards they maintain for all guests. All staff members on Valley Wing Reception were fabulous. It is our intention to return here as soon as possible so…",5,March 2018,
An excellent stay,AEE2,"We had three nights in Shanghai-La Hotel, Singapore. We will like to come back. Beautiful hotel, excellent rooms, excellent breakfast, very clean, very friendly staff.  It is situated a little outside the centre of the city which we liked. Access to the centre is easy. We stayed in the top floors and had lovely view over Singapore.  The last day before leaving for the airport was spent in the garden by the pool. Lovely and relaxing. We had lunch in the outdoor restaurant before leaving for the airport. But service there was very slow, so if you are doing the same, I would recommend you to do that in good time before you have to change clothes and leave for the airport. This was the only disadvantage.   I highly recommend Shangri-La Singapore. An excellent hotel. ",5,February 2018,
Top notch,cascade h,"Stayed here for 3 nights , it's top class , staff are very nice .special thanks to farah and her colleague ( forgot her name ) who welcomed us .

Welcome back old timer,Allan F,"My wife and I stayed several times at this property 40+ years ago and since then with our near yearly visit to Singapore we have tried many other hotels including the fantastic Marina Bay Sands. This time we had 3 days to fill in before heading off on a cruise. So why not relax and enjoy what we remembered the lush grounds of this hotel. At Shangrila properties we are now lazy and book the Horizon Club rooms. A little more but worth it at our stage of life.  Immediate check-in on level 24 and we were allocated a great room. The beauty of this type of room is the availability of a good breakfast, a great weight gaining afternoon tea and enough wine and nibbles at sunset. We took two guest to this level at 6.00pm and the cost was S$80 per head but well worth it for the peace and…",5,April 2018,
Great first stop on our South East Asia Tour,Harribaz,We stayed in the Valley Wing which is essentially a 5 star small hotel within the larger Shangri La Hotel. Service and room were excellent. The main hotel which is much larger is fine but much noisier and more larger group focused. Central for pretty much anywhere in the city.,5,April 2018,

Excellent for business/conferences, this hotel features various restaurants and cuisines, excellent conferencing facilities, lovely pool and very helpful staff. Cannot be faulted! ",5,May 2017,
Amazing service,joandgr,"We recently stayed at the hotel for three nights prior to a cruise and would be happy to stay again the next time we visit Singapore.  We upgraded to a garden room and as it was our honeymoon they gave us several goodies.  We had breakfast outside of the Waterfall restaurant two mornings which was really lovely,the selection of food and the service was very good,however it was closed on the third morning and we had to go the main restaurant and queue for a table,it was very very busy and service and food was not up to the usual Shangri-La standards.  We enjoyed drinks in the lounge which were the usual price for a five star hotel.  But normally its the service from all staff which makes this hotel group stand out from the rest.",4,February 2018,

So wonderful for kids!,SwindyR,Stayed for 4 nights here in mid April as a family holiday with two kids in a deluxe premier club room. The room is wonderfully spacious and really useful for the kids to have a space to eat/play/move around. Having recently been renovated the bathrooms particularly were big and very comfortable but everything about the room was really very nice. And unexpectedly there was a sink and microwave in the room which was so perfect for me to wash the baby bottles etc.  It’s unusual to have to pay for the kids club when you’re a hotel guest I found (only free if you’re staying in the ‘family’ rooms) which is a bit limiting. But that’s the only negative about the hotel.  The kids club is more like a indoor play Centre than a typical kids club so I didn’t feel comfortable leaving my…,5,April 2018,
Pure lixury,Sanjeev B,"Absolutely amazing from the moment we arrived to the time of our departure. Loved everything about this hotel. The staff, the service and the food.

Nothing beats Valley Wing!,jhedin2016,"Don't know where to start?! From the moment we arrived to Valley Wing, until we checked out was just like 4 days in heaven! The Valley Wing itself is fantastic and the staff is likely the best hotell staff in the world. I can't recall all the names, but to mention a few; Vanessa and Aeisha in the front dest; always smiling, relaxed friendly and helpful. Our new French friend, Dominique who made our breakfasts memorable.   We had a slight problem with our room which was taken care of in the best possible way, thanks Vanessa!  Can't wait to go back - this is for sure my new favorite hotel in the world! This is the place to stay when in Singapore.  Thanks to all of you who made our stay amazing!",5,April 2018,

The hotel gardens are amazing and it has a good sized pool, there is a health club and sauna/steam room but I didn't manage to use them. We were booked into the club level rooms and on entering the hotel we were escorted to the club lounge to check in. We had a lovely room in the tower wing. The staff were excellent and very helpful.

Family floor - this is very helpful for me who struggled with a kid and a baby. Washing machine, dryer, hot water, high chair, bath toys, etc.   Buds - great to keep the kids busy.   Pool - love it. No soaking in cold cold water.   Staffs - friendly and helpful. Thank you.  Overall, best staycation I had.  Food - a little disappointing. Many choices at buffet but nothing fabulous....

Superb ending to our holidays,Yveline Q,My husband and I have just returned from spending three memorable days at the valley wing of the Shangrila Singapore. This oasis is located in a beautiful and convenient part of Singapore.  The decor is elegant and the garden outlooks particularly attractive.  The characteristic  which distinguishes this hotel is the professionalism and friendliness of its staff. We highly recommend this hotel.,5,April 2018,
Not sure we'll return,Lea B,"Our family of four recently spent two nights at the Shangri-La Singapore. Overall it was very nice but for the money we spent I'm not sure we'll return. The location is nice - quiet and safe but it's a treck to even pick up some essential snacks/supplies for the kids. And you wouldn't visit the shop in the lobby as it's outright exorbitant - it looks good though! Check-in was pretty slow but it's not that big a deal. The Tower Wing room was way too small for us so we paid extra to get a Garden View room  which suited us more. The staff made up a bed and put some groovy teddy bears for the kids which was nice of them.  Pool is really great and breakfast buffet is plentiful.

I highly recommend the Valley Wing for true indulgence   The Valley wing has its own separate arrival area and the lobby is truly beautiful  When we arrived we where greeted by friendly smiling front of house staff and they could not have done more to make our check in more simple.

Great Staycation,Ben,Check in was a breeze and we were served by the lovely Cory who was such a pleasant front office manager. Breakfast tends to get crowded at the Line with long queues. Otherwise we had a lovely stay to celebrate my son's birthday. Highly recommended for families with kids.,4,April 2018,
So disappointing,Julia G,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights after our Thailand holiday and before flying back to the UK. Expect so much more for the £250 plus we paid per night. Don’t get me wrong, the rooms are nice, gardens beautiful and lobby grand, but in my view there was a general feeling of apathy that ran right through the hotel. There were numerous niggles from the outset which we would have let go, but they all added to a sense of dissatisfaction. We had to complain about service at both The line restaurant and Waterfall where a basic order took 50 minutes to arrive and on one occasion was stone cold. We really expected so much more from this hotel chain, needless to say, we won’t be staying at any of their other hotels around the world",3,April 2018,
Gorgeous hotel and brilliant staff,Destinationdesign,"Loved this hotel.  Stayed in the Valley Wing.  Food was delicious and plentiful.  Decor and furnishings very nice.  The room was spacious.  The grounds are luscious.  Loved the concierge, front desk, Valley Wing servers.  Valley Wing was very quiet, probably not somewhere I would stay with my children, who are quite well behaved.  Although I did see children and love travelling with my children, I don't feel it is the best setting for children.  They would enjoy the Tower Wing more and I believe that there are more activities for them in the Tower Wing.  If you are trying to call a taxi or uber from the Valley Wing, do so early, as it took about 30 minutes - 45 minutes on two occasions to arrive.  Gym was nice.  We didn't eat breakfast in the Valley Wing restaurant, but rather…",5,March 2018,

The best dining experience ever,Don K,"The hotel has a dining for 2 tasting experience in the garden, in an Orchid covered structure. The setting is unbelievable as it's intimate yet close to the hotel. Thanks to Stephen for his brilliant services and for making the evening so special. The menu is customise to suit taste and fresh produce, while the wine pairing is top class. The chef Mirko is a genius both in skill of cooking and explaining each course.

The perfect place in Singapore,Global Traveler,While the Shangri La is not the newest hotel it's still one of the very best.  It's in a great location and the service can't be beat.

The Shangri La represents what all great hotels should be.,5,April 2018,
Sooooo lives up to it's name,deirodeir,"I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel or its staff. We stayed there in Jan and again in March. The location is good, convenient to shops but not in the city. The lobby is very interesting, the rooms are impeccable, the pool, waterfall and gardens are a delight. The standard of food is excellent, and the elevators do not keep you waiting. The staff are efficient, polite, welcoming,informative, and above all, friendly. We had membership of the Horizon Club which is well worth the money; the food and drinks are mouth-watering, and there are views over the city from the lounge. Just perfect.",5,March 2018,
Beautiful facilities with garden area,Vivian G,"beautiful hotel ! this was indeed a 5 star hotel conveniently located near copious shopping malls on Orchard. This hotel was recently renovated in May 2017 and I feel in love the moment i stepped into the lobby. The front desk was efficient and seamless. We got to our room in the new Club wing and it was very sleek and comfortable. The room was a bit smaller than I thought but i loved the glass closets and the shower was perfect (especially after a humid day in SG).   The restaurants (Orgin, Nami, and Lobby Lounge) were all amazing and the service was impeccable.

Golden circle,Danielle N,"Hello  Thankyou for having my family  A lovely hotel, I did not think it is as good as the one in bkk. Most of the staff were friendly but only after they knew I was a diamond member. The staff at breakfast on the first day were very rude, I had to go directly to the head chief to ask him what the standards are expected of there staff. It was really bad, it was like the staff did not want to be there. This was at 6. 30 am in the morning. We were quiet shocked infact, we didn’t feel that we were in a shangrla. But on the second day it got better.  The gym is first class for a hotel. Pool area only fair.  The kids club is top class and the staff in there were of high quality, best through out the hotel.

MY GO-TO HOTEL IN ASIA,Kelly M,FIRST RATE OPERATION --It is old and has been redone but without losing it's charm---this is the first Shangri-La built and the concept has done well--This place is very business and family oriented so it gets a little frenentic but we love it. We always get premium rooms and the Horizon club to make best use of the facilities.  My favorite is the S L in Hong Kong  becuse the premium rooms are on the same floor as the Horizon Club.,5,April 2018,

Wonderful Hotel,Joe B,"We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of our holidays.  We chose the Garden Wing with a pool view as we wanted to enjoy sitting out on the balcony.  As expected from the Shangri-La, everything was excellent from the service to the facilities, pool, gym, restaurants and lounge bar. The staff are always friendly and helpful.  Knowing it was our Silver Wedding Anniversary trip, we were treated to flowers  and a cake - a nice and welcome touch.  Thank you ",5,April 2018,

First time back since the lobby renovations,snerd45,"This is the hotel that tries very hard to impress, and very rarely fails to knock your socks off. This was my first visit since the lobby was renovated, and it was such a case of WOW for me that it was almost sensory overload. The lobby bar, the reception area, even the 2 turned tree root boles that stood guard on the front door were just inspired. The Bell Captain recognised me and we had a chat whilst we were waiting for a taxi, and his smile, his pride at my obvious enjoyment of the surroundings was so nice to see. One small hiccup, (certainly not the hotels fault) someones child had defecated in the pool, and we were asked to exit the pool whilst they shock treated it. I guess such a beautiful hotel will attract its share of careless parents...  Again, so well worth the…",5,March 2018,
What an Oasis,Rebecca F,"I loved this hotel. Most 5 star hotels in Singapore are in a concrete jungle and swimming pools etc. are usually on the roof not exciting.

Great oasis a short walk to Orchard Road.,Simon G,"Stayed recently for work and having stayed in other hotels in Singapore this is my new favourite. Big, plush and well laid out. Friendly check in staff and a great hotel room. Big, clean space with both a bath and separate shower which is rare in hotels these days. Big king bed with a great lounge chair and good desk space. Add in some free bottles of water which are a must in Singapore and the room was great all round. Pretty good wifi as well. Breakfast has an amazing range of options for all types of cuisine and a quick omelette counter.  The gym was huge with a great range of walkers, treadmills, pin machines and free weights.

Renovated but impersonal and tired,dan_from_oz,"Having had quite high expectations for our stay at the Shangri-La in Singapore I was quite disappointed by the average customer service and tired rooms in the garden wing.  Please also be aware if you are in a rush for breakfast don’t have breakfast at the hotel.  I found it quite fitting that the restaurant the hotel provides breakfast at is called the line buffet because that’s where you will spend most of your time... standing in a line waiting to be seated! (Please see photos).  One highlight was the kids club, my daughter enjoyed it very much and the facilities and staff are amazing.  All in all I would describe it as an adequate stay but I won’t be returning... there are much better options in Singapore.",3,April 2018,

Loved the compound with pockets of greenery to walk around. Even though they were operating at full capacity, there were still many empty spaces that we can walk about in. Many different restaurants to choose from. They also have a children's BUD program that would work well for families with kids. The garden wing which we stayed at was clean and spacious. Although the rooms do look quite dated. The gym was large with a squat rack and lots of other equipment.

IF YOU WANT FIVE STARS THIS IS FOR YOU.,Malrider48,It is a very nice hotel with friendly staff.  However it was not my cup of tea you do pay premium price for everything.  Stay away from the $95 dinner it's not worth it and there is better value in in one of its restaurants.  We stayed two night on the way over and one night on our return.  A friend had organised the trip and had previously phone the hotel to ensure our booking were there.  On our return at 4pm (check in 2pm) our rooms were not ready and after waiting for a while they offered free drinks in the lounge which we took up.  Our rooms were finally ready at 5.15pm and they had upgraded us to other rooms. Probably the only ones they had.  When checking out the next morning I discovered the complementary drinks had been added to my bill.  This was an embarrassment for…,4,March 2018,
Excellent family resort in the middle of Singapore,RockYu,"Shangri-La Singapore is an excellent option for family travel. The hotel has an excellent pool with a nice shallow area for young kids whilst also having a deep section cordoned off for adults. There’s a wonderful kids club (additional cost) which has wonderful indoor and outdoor play areas (including a water park) and cooking / drama / art classes). The buffet breakfast has a wide selection catering for Eastern and Western tastes and the in-room dining has excellent kids options. The hotel isn’t overwhelmed by kids either, there’s enough space for all hotel guests and the rooms are amazingly quiet. For a family friendly hotel, we did not hear any children either above, below or around us.  The hotel service is top notch. We were impressed from the moment our taxi stopped at the…",4,April 2018,
Simply perfect - this is a luxury hotel,Gl0be_Tr0tter_14,"This is very rare I give a rating of five  This stay has been just perfect and even when I have had small issues they were perfectly handled.  The hotel is not cheap but it is worth the cost.  Service is perfect.  Facilities are exceptional  Executive lounge food and drinks are over the top.   The only real issue is that, if you are a bit lazy, you may not want to get out the hotel and explore SINGAPORE. You feel so good at this Shangri La and there is absolutely everything that you do not want to go. ",5,April 2018,
1 star at check-in... 5 stars with dining experience hence had to rate at 3 stars,Princess T,"For the hotel reference, our confirmation # 141169241 for 2 nights Garden Wing room Staycation package on this Easter weekend.

From arrival, here is the list of very fundamental things that you would expect from Shangri-la, a prestige 5 stars hotel, that HAD previously brought many beautiful memories for me and my husband.  But, all went wrong, spoiling our mood completely at the start of our anniversary staycation.   1) We arrived 2.40pm on 29 March and waited 15mins in the check-in queue, we are next in Q.

Waterfall Ristorante Italiano - Italian Restaurant,Richard4411,"Good food, good service and most of all it is so value for money.

Best Italian Restaurant is at The Shangrila Hotel Singapore t - Waterfall Ristorante Italiano,Lyn Lyn Peh,Waterfall Ristornate Italiano is one of the best Italian Restaurant I ever try. I went there with a group of eight and everyone loves the food. The restaurant manager- Mr Andreano Carbotti had arranged the menu according to our liking and taste . Service is excellent and most importantly the price is very reasonable.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for those who loves good Italian food and need not have to burn a big hole in their pocket. This is a very relaxing restaurant and the environment is very cosy.  So do visit Waterfall Ristorante Italiano which is located at The Shangrila Hotel Singapore.   The,4,March 2018,
Fantastic service,Amanda K,"The beautiful grounds and pool were the drawcard for us for a girls weekend, but I would come back for the service. We stayed at the Valley Wing where we were looked after by Raja and Aishah who were delightful and very helpful. Service was amazing. We had originally booked into the Horizon Club, but upgraded to Valley to include the Champagne Bar which was fantastic. The breakfast buffet at the Line offered an amazing array of international foods, but we could have chosen to eat at the quieter, more serene restaurant in the Valley.  The Line was very busy on the weekend. The rooms were very generously sized. The decor is very traditional, and the clientele older, but I would splurge for the Valley Wing  if you get the chance. ",5,March 2018,
Will be back!,francis2120,"Bit far out but the Hotel overcomes this disadvantage by providing excellent facilities, food and service. The Horizon club is well worth the extra spend and nothing is too much trouble for the friendly staff. Have stayed before and will return.",5,March 2018,
Valley Wing - so relaxing,Joanne L,"We had a girls weekend away in Singapore and could not have picked a better place to stay. The Valley Wing was amazing, Rooms, bathroom and views were fabulous. The pool area is an oasis of calm. Stayed in many other hotels in Singapore but this one felt like a true resort.  Breakfast buffet was delicious and vast though the fit out was like a canteen and didn't quite fit in with the rest of the hotel. The shuttle was a bit hit and miss. It didn't always come at the stated times but still it is a good service to offer. The highlight for us though was the club lounge. Champagne and great selection of wines available. The food was average but the service particularly from the fabulous Raja and Aishah made our whole trip. They just made our stay feel like a dream. Thank you Raja…",4,March 2018,
Excellence on every level,One_Santos,"Have visited numerous times through work, but stayed on with my Mrs. for some extra days before travelling on. Fast check in & out, welcoming, professional and efficient staff. Always willing with suggestions on where to eat and visit. The rooms are well presented and clean, with good connectivity i.e. plenty of USB ports for charging. Pool is amazing as too is the choice for breakfast. I often travel globally for work, but this has to be one of the nicest lobby’s of any hotel.",5,March 2018,
As Expected...Perfect In All Departments...,Gary L,"We decided to spend our 'cotton' wedding anniversary at the hotel.  From check in at the Horizon Club to check out, everything was done professionally and with a BIG smile. I cannot fault this place. Ms Janice Ang (Manager), Ms Rachael Wong and the rest of the team on the 24th floor did a suburb job of attending to our needs. The room was nice, room service quick and good. We never saw the room service crew, but bed were made and room cleaned.  The pool was big but not really for laps. Still we had a nice swim. Dinner at Orginsand Grill was great but that will be under my restaurants review. We wanted to try the 'Line restaurant' for breakfast but there was a line so we decided to have it at the Club floor. Breakfast was nice good range of local and western dishes. Overall very…",5,March 2018,
Valley Wing - like coming home,irma1953,"We had a superbe stay, as always, only that this time there was a little crisis involving hospitalisation of my 93 year old mother. The Valley Wing employees supported me in every way they could and gave me strength during a challenging time far away from home. When my Mum returned, the warmest welcome back you could possibly imagine was rendered to her. We truly were touched. This was not just professional customer service, this was genuine care !!",5,February 2018,
Family Fun Staycation,PoojaKawatra,"We recently had a staycation at Shangri la and stayed in one of the family rooms. This is one of the friendliest and most exciting places for families with kids. It comes with organic kids toiletries and an entire floor which caters mainly to family suites with 24 hours complimentary access to central, shared Pantry.  They have also got a huge indoor playground- Buds with slides, ball pool, sandpit, shooting areas.   Our check in was pretty quick and in house staff was quite helpful. You got to check their swimming pool with hot jacuzzi and trust me it was so relaxing.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals at Waterfall restaurant and Buffet at Line with a  wide range of spread. Would definitely recommend it especially for families with kids.",5,March 2018,
Does what it says on the tin.,KerryJBailey,"Good hotel. Slight issue with the drainage system in the shower, but this did get rectified.  The selection at breakfast is outstanding, and a real credit to the hotel.  Check out service was very efficient. All round a good stay.",4,March 2018,
Location challenged,Labonnevie_12,"This hotel has everything you could want: excellent facilities, attentive staff, attractive rooms. However, it is location challenged. It is a long way from any of the major attractions in Singapore, except perhaps the botanical gardens. There is no shopping or restaurants close by. They have also closed their shop so you can not buy any souvenirs onsite. Orchard Road is a good walk away from the hotel and in the heat and humidity not something you want to do frequently. It seems to be primarily a business hotel catering to meetings so the location may not be a problem for their customers. As tourists, we would have hoped for a hotel closer to the major visitor spots.",4,March 2018,
Dinner,Peter Scheer,"We had an Italian dinner. Service was lousy to say the least. I had veal masseter and my wife linguine frutti di mare. Well. Wine was okay. The garden outstanding. The bar in the main lobby: good music, good Singapur Sling for $ 25.-/each. ",3,March 2018,
Nice Hotel with a very good service.,Ali J,I've been in this hotel in March with my family and we've got very good service when checking in. The person who helped me very much during our stay was Mr. Swaran Muru. He is assistant Front Office Manager and very helpful.

Maybe Mr Swaran can do that when reading this comment:)  Thank you for everything and take care Swaran.,5,March 2018,

Pleasant stay in Singapore,Iambagered,"We had a nice stay at the Shangri-La, but it should be nice for the price! We went with our 2 year old and chose it as it is billed as family friendly with the newly opened BUDS play zone. Although this was good we were disappointed guests still had to pay an additional $18 to use it and that only one adult per child was allowed, meaning we couldn’t all have fun together. The pool was nice with a little children’s play area. The breakfast was great, with loads of choice of western and Asian foods, freshly cooked eggs etc.   We stayed in the Valley wing, the room was nice and spacious and had a good view of pool and gardens. It was good that along with this we got complimentary cocktails and snacks at the bar. However as we weren’t allowed to take them to the room it made it hard…",4,March 2018,
Perfect end to a trip,Riorussa,Stayed in the Valley Wing at the end of a six star cruise. Some of the other cruisers were there.

Line Restaurant,Ritz R,"My sister had pre arranged dinner for my birthday and she was assured of a surprise arrangement at the end of the meal. Dinner was good but when she tried getting staff's attention... it was to no avail and when she finally got their attention, she was presented with the bill to pay. After it was signed ....with much ambarassment my sister had to ask about the birthday surprise. The staff simply wrapped a piece of cake and handed over for takeaway. The expectation was set by restaurant staff at point of booking but not delivered. Family felt the birthday dinner ended unpleasantly and the surprise planned was not fulfilled. It did ruin the celebration mood. Dissappointed.",3,March 2018,

I was told that the room was not ready, which I fully accepted and was asked to return about midday, I checked again at midday and then again at 1pm, the room was still not ready. I was then informed by a member of staff that no rooms of this type were available.

HIGH CLASS AND QUITE EXCELLENT,NCG,"This was the second time my wife and I stayed in the Singapore Shangri-La Hotel’s Valley Wing. As before, everything was excellent. The staff were, without any exception, absolutely charming, the room (and the bed) were extremely comfortable, the breakfast in the Vallet Wing’s exclusive restaurant was all that one could possibly want. Afternoon tea, drinks and canapes were all included and were very welcome. There was nothing that could be faulted and we would, most certainly, stay there again.

The best hotel I have ever stayed in,Roger P,"I have been to the Shangri-La many times over the last 30 years, and always rated it very highly.   A recent visit confirmed this view.    One of its good features is the Horizon Club, open to some privileged guests for breakfast and pre-dinner drinks     Part of the charm of the Club was the attentive staff asking whether one would like a second cup of coffee or second glass of wine, always in a quiet but friendly manner. In the last year, some ""designer"" has wrecked this.   One now has to get one's own coffee from a sophisticated machine - after about four visits one gets the hang of it, but it can't smile or comment on the probability of rain, although the coffee is good, as fresh beans are used. But the real foolishness lies in the machine which dispenses wine.   No further…",5,March 2018,

Enjoyable stay!,Jeme1211,"I really enjoyed staying at Valley Wing. Afternoon tea and champagne with piano playing at the lobby lounge was a real treat. Breakfast had good spread and dinner buffet at the line was decent. What really made this hotel stand out from other 5* hotels in Singapore was their management. They genuinely care about guest experience at the hotel. Even there might be some minor issues during your stay, they gave no excuse but address to them to make sure guest satisfaction. This is the hotel I always want to re-visit.",5,March 2018,
no other hotel like it,LQM1507,"Stayed at the Valley wing.  Everything is beyond perfect.  Tiny details to nurture and excite are always there.

Best Hotel in Singapore! A must stay!,Boon S,"I come to Singapore on business and pleasure often and the “Shang” (as locals call it ) is by far the best hotel. The staff is extremely attentive and polite. Special mention are bellhops Elvis and Bani, and manager Jonathan Sim. Rooms are very clean and modern. The grounds are amazingly lush, it’s like leaving in the middle of a tropical rain forest. The breakfast buffet is amazingly good and one can find a wide range of local and classic western food. I love the gym which is well equip and one never has to wait because they have so many machines. Did I mention that they have great live music at their lounge off the hotel lobby?  I will definitively recommend anyone looking for a leisure or business hotel. ",5,March 2018,

Return visit to Valley Wing,Tim S,"We so enjoyed our last visit that when we decided to spend a few days in Singapore on our return from Australia this was our only real choice. The gardens and pool are such a great feature of this hotel and since we last visited in 2010 there has been a great deal of renovation to the other wings. Valley is rather special. We requested a room overlooking the lovely gardens so were disappointed on arrival to be shown to a City view room. However, in no time at all we were then shown to one on the garden/pool side which was perfect.

More Wing than Valley.,MelbourneFirst,Luxury or 5 stars will always be subjective based on your own experiences in hotels and cruises.  Shangri-la Singapore is really transitioning from a luxury hotel to a new city style resort and this is changing all the three wings.  I have stayed at this hotel often and most times in the Valley Wing but over times have stayed in all three wings.  Most of the Shangri-la Valley Wing Staff as others have mentioned are good really good.  They are engaging and service orientated and appear to be really genuine.  Remembering that often Shangri-la Singapore is one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore its worthwhile looking at the product rather than the staff.

What to say?  It's the Shang,J123456789,"We stayed here before.  This time over Chinese New Year in a Garden View room.  Not sure they are worth the premium over Tower rooms but I've always wanted to stay in one.  The room, service, cleaning, food and facilities were perfect.  We went to breakfast before 8 am and it was not crowded.  As always breakfast was fantastic, incredible choice of excellent quality.  Only the coffee is awful which seems to be the rule in SE Asia so stick to tea.  There were queues for breakfast around 9 am, common sense tells you it doesn't make sense for everyone to come at the same time when there is full occupancy.

Shangri-la Valley Wing is like a fairytale,janvat,Shangri-la Valley Wing is the best hotel in the world. The service and hospitality are outstanding and not comparable to any other hotels in the world. You are treated like kings and queens! The breakfast is world class.

Rooms, breakfast simply divine although breakfast can get a little chaotic with everyone walking around the buffet getting their own food. On the first night suffering from jet lag we opted to eat in the Lobby bar area, I cannot recall exactly what the dish was but it was what turned up was basically a couple of poor looking chicken thighs in a watery mixture.

Very nice hotel,SeeTheW0rld62,"I stayed at the Shangri-la on a recent trip to Singapore and enjoyed my stay. I got in late after 40 hours of traveling and incredibly slow immigration at the airport. The cool pink grapefruit juice they gave me at check in was refreshing.  The room was very comfortable with a firm mattress which was great for my back. The hotel is also very quiet, I never heard any sound from another room. I was there the week before Chinese New Year and the decorations in the lobby were beautiful. ",4,February 2018,
Elegant Hotel,Conradsz,"As is typical the lobby area of the Singapore Shangri-La is simply spectacular!  At night there is live entertainment in the lobby lounge adding to the ambience.  The rooms feature a bay window design and are generally spacious.  There are 5 restaurants on the property. The grounds are spacious with a large pool and tennis courts. The location is close to the Orchard Road shopping area, but is a mile or two away from the major tourist destinations.",5,February 2018,
Excellent Attitude - Making you feel at home,tjlovetotravel,We stayed for 1 night at Shangri- La at Orchard in the Tower Wing. Greeted warmly during check in which make you feel at home. Room size was good and room were very clean. Rooms were refurbished. I cannot say the same for Line and Shang Palace as they do not seems to be attentive or service oriented especially during breakfast when there were plenty of guest in the restuarant.... Hotel offer bus shuttles to Orchard shopping during the day and also to major offices in the morning as well. It is about 10 mins walk to Ion Orchard.,5,February 2018,
Don’t hesitate to stay here!,Ralph R,"The hotel is well located within a 15 min walk of both Orchard Road and the Botanical Gardens.  We understand that the hotel underwent a major refurbishment in 2017,  and it definitely sparkles!  The staff were very customer friendly, professional and very helpful.  The gardens around the hotel are lovingly tended and orchids abound.  The swimming pool is a feature in itself.  The rooms are well appointed with tea and coffee making facilities, a fabulous shower and a very comfortable bed.  A lot of choice for places to eat in the hotel, for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea or just a snack.   Thoroughly recommend.",5,January 2018,
Arrogance and complacency does not make a 5 star hotel,nissemand,"My family (two adults, two children) recently spent one night at this hotel taking advantage of one of their ""Family Fun""-packages. Well, what a disappointment! The hotel recently opened their newly refurbished ""Family Rooms"" and a quite wonderful kids' club area (which our kids loved). Sadly, the family rooms are not so wonderful, unless you consider a ""family"" two adults and only one child. We booked a staycation with two children (8 and 10) and found - to our surprise - when we checked in that one of our children was expected to sleep in the same bed as the parents. This is NOT pointed out on the website and the family rooms are basically marketed on the basis of false advertising. The rooms are too small for an extra bed and the hotel did not attempt to move us to a…",2,February 2018,

Fabulous!,kbayes,"My wife and I were travelling back from a business trip/holiday in Australia and stayed here. We were checked in by Janice who was delightful and very helpful. She was a fantastic representative for the hotel! Our room was excellent and beautifully fitted out. The grounds are lovely, especially the orchid area. Plenty of places to eat and drink. We really look forward to coming back again; a perfect choice when you visit Singapore! Thank you.",5,January 2018,
First class hotel,James G,This is the jewel in the crown for the Shangri-La  hotel chain regarded as one of the worlds finest hotels in the world there are 3 sections to this hotel recommend the Garden Wing as all rooms have a balcony staying in this hotel is not cheap but as most people know Singapore itself is not a cheap destination to visit.,5,February 2018,
Beautiful lobby lounge and attentive service,Traveltheworld,"We enjoyed our afternoon drinks at the lovely lounge with the amazing service crews. The chair is so comfortable and those sunlight give it some adding points. Best lounge I have been so far.  Oh they have wine inspired tea selection as well, tasted superb!  Definitely will come back again.  Thanks for the lady manager kamika, her service teams for their hospitality. ",5,December 2017,
Great hotel,desinerg,Great hotel with nice rooms. The lobby is very nice with some nice artwork. Staff are friendly. Rooms are very large and very comfortable. Pool area is very relaxing.

"Total Joy at The Shangri-La, Singapore",Ellen H,"Another fabulous stay at this wonderful hotel.  We have been visiting here for years and just love returning.  We usually stay in the Valley Wing these days, but have stayed in all 3 wings over the years and always great to see so many of the staff who have been there for years. As mentioned there are 3 separate wings, all are quite lovely, but the advice really is to research each of them to see which appeals as all offer something very different. Lots of options for families with younger children too. We were delighted to see the new Tower Wing following the major renovations.  Somehow they have managed to incorporate exquisite modern design on a grand scale without losing the serenity and that special Asian essence of the Shangri-La.  The new Lobby is wonderful.  We tried the…",5,January 2018,
OK hotel with advantages and disadvantages,StEw115,"I stayed for business about one week in the SL SIN.   1. Service Checkin was average, took some time until it was my turn despite the queue being quite small. Room was not ready but I waited in the lobby and was picked up when room was ready. That was ok.  The service throughout the hotel is good and comparably attentative.  The room service is ok but not outstanding. Despite my numerous reminder that the hair dryer was missing, they failed to provide one. Cleaning was not always without issue, but in general ok.   2. Room Bed, linen and pillows are good.  I booked a king size and was provided twin bed room - a bit of a disappointment.  The bathroom is of decent size and was nice.  Best working spot with desk in front of the window overlookin Singapore.  3. Facilities I used…",4,January 2018,
Still a great hotel but breakfast queues need addressing,Dannyboy83,Stayed here for the fourth time and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel pool area really feels like an island resort which considering the location in the centre of Singapore is special. Service Is as expected with Shangri-La and amazing.  The only low point was the breakfast queuing system. It is really broken and the management need to fix this. Waiting up to 30 minutes to get a table is unacceptable especially when approximately half the tables are empty. There simply aren’t enough staff to organise things promptly for guests. It didn’t use to be this way so please fix ahead of my next visit.,4,January 2018,
Incredible!,Jen A,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Beautiful rooms and the service can't be beat. The spa was lovely and the pool amazing. We loved the food, especially the in room dining! We will definitely be back!",5,April 2017,
Singapore stop over,irshaadsayed,"We always like stopping over in singapore for a few days on our way home to and from New Zealand. This time we spent a few nights at the shangri la in orchard. It’s a good location, walking distance to major shopping centres but also far enough from The bustle or orchard road. The newly renovated rooms are nice and there are plenty activities for kids. The only problem we had was the internet in our room, we had no signal from our bedroom, only in lounge area on the otherwise of the suite, I alerted staff about the problem but it was never resolved, I eventually gave up asking but in a way it was good as I got a lot more reading done.

In the lap of luxury!,Pradeep M,"We stayed in the Valley Wing of the Shangri La hotel and as soon as we arrived we realised we had arrived in luxury!  From being greeted by Vanessa and delivered to our room to being waved goodbye by Nora, the Wing Manager, we had a fantastic experience.   Breakfast taken in the Summit Room was a beautiful start to the day, afternoon tea was available,  but we didn’t indulge, but we did enjoy the very professional care of Rajan in the Champagne Bar in the early evening with vodka martini, Champagne, gin and tonics and, of course, the famous Singapore Sling. All created to perfection.  This hotel and in particular the Valley Wing offers impeccable service and attention to detail.  Our only criticism is it is very expensive to eat in the hotel restaurants..",5,January 2018,
We found our new favourite hotel in Singapore,BFGMelbourne,"We stayed as a family for several days in a Tower Wing Horizon Club Grand Premier King room.  Pro's:  1.  Amazing service.  We arrived off an early flight from Europe (8am), our transfer was waiting for us, and at the hotel we were whisked to the club lounge to have drinks and eat while staff checked us in.  Seamless, which is rare (and extra appreciated) when traveling with kids.  Check-out was similarly stress-free, and we were allowed a late check-out.    2. The staff at the club lounge were fantastic.  They helped organise a nanny.  They helped cleaning baby bottles and warming milk.  Nothing was too much, and they did everything with a smile.  They made the stay for us.  3. Club lounge itself was great - lots of food at various times of day, and a decent breakfast (and…",5,January 2018,
Amazing New Family Themed Rooms,leematthews251,"We recently booked a 2 night staycation at the Shangri La Orchard for my birthday, but also for something different to do with my 3 year old Daughter and 9 month Son. As a Diamond member we have stayed in many of the Shangri-La locations around the Asia region, and like them this visit did not disappoint. The newly refurbished Tower Wing and kids club (Buds) had just opened and we booked one of the 5 family themed rooms (Space) which was amazing. So as well as a deluxe room for Mum and dad there is a second bedroom attached for the kids which includes an accessible tunnel between the two rooms, as well a kids area to play and eat plus lots of kids amenities. Each theme is different and our one being the Space theme had a spaceship bunk bed which my daughter absolutely loved! …",5,January 2018,
Great welcome,MathewKaley,"There are a lot of good hotels in Singapore. What stood out for us with the Shangri-La on our recent stopover was the welcome. We've travelled plenty with the kids, but the journey from Frankfurt to Singapore didn't go as smoothly as usual. Our 7 year old was unwell on the flight and then sick in the taxi on the way in. There was a part of us that just wanted to get home to Australia at that point.  That all changed the moment we arrived at the Shangri-La. A lovely gentleman greeted us and introduced us to our designated representative. It was only 8am, so we were expecting the normal offer to use the facilities until our room became free, but no - they took us straight to a smaller room that was free and allowed us to use that. What a huge difference it made, to be able to sort…",5,January 2018,

They had a policy of NO  children under 12 when we stopped , so check first , cannot wait to return",5,December 2017,
Fabulous Holiday,Chris D,"The welcome we received on our arrival was wonderful and we were accompanied to the Horizon Club Lounge where the check in process was easy and relaxed. We had stayed in a few Shangri-la hotels before, but this was the first visit to this particular hotel. We stayed 16 nights in the Tower Wing Horizon Club Deluxe Room.  We were belatedly celebrating our wedding anniversary and were treated to a lovely surprise cake in our room. It really made our day. Thank you so much. The room was pleasant enough but on the small side for a long stay. There was nowhere to sit other than on the bed or one small uncomfortable desk chair. After a few nights we asked for some comfortable chairs to sit in but as the room was so small we were told they would not fit. We were moved to a corner room…",5,January 2018,
Excellent!,Nancy T,"Exceeded my expectations! Clean beautiful large rooms, The bed sheets and comfy pillows are to die for! Turn down service with chocolates on the pillow. Quality bathroom toiletries. Staff very helpful as is the doorman and other door staff. I cannot fault any if my recent experience at this wonderful hotel.",5,January 2018,
Beautiful hotel,Elsa,We were so happy to have spent our holiday in Shangri-La hotel. Overall everything was on point from the beginning until the end of our trip. Although there are many visitors staffs touch is still personal and you are warmly greeted when you arrive.  Our room was at the tower wing. It was new and spacious and had a nice view over the city. Next time I would book a room from the garden wing because it's so special. Something to improve would be a pillow menu and slippers to use at the pool area. And maybe to remove desk from the window because it's blocking best view.  Service was excellent. Concierge was helpful in any questions.  There are many restaurants to choose from. The Line is a buffet restaurant but you definitely have to try its variation of different foods and tastes.…,5,December 2017,

Obviously a 5 star hotel but is it worth the money?,CarlEdinburgh,"I stayed for 3 nights in the newly refurbished tower section of the hotel and while it was obviously really nice I'm not convinced it was worth the money.  I had no complaints about the room as they were amazing and the general decor and finish of the hotel are top class.  However, the location is a bit out of the way and the most disappointing thing was the quality of the breakfast.  It seems that they think that quantity mean quality in Singapore as I found this at other hotels.  To be fair to them it's because they need to cater to a wide variety of cultures.  However, most of the quality was at best average.  Compared to the 5 star hotels in other countries I've been to it was the quality that you would expect to get at a 3 star hotel.  For example:  - There was no fresh…",3,January 2018,

Its still an amazing place to stay,amaaten10,"Shangri la Singapore is among my favorite hotels in the world. Always like the great service, the swimming pools, the food and more. This was the first time I stayed here since the renovation of the tower wing. We had a Tower Wing horizon Club Grand premier room, which gave acces to the Horizon club. The club is certainly worth the extra money you pay for it with nice food and drinks. With my little child we had during cocktail hours club acces from 5.00-6.30. From 6.30-8.00 small children were not allowed, which I can understand. Although it was pity for us. The service in the club was very good. It was only pity that they didn't service anymore real cocktails anymore except Singapore Sling. But there are plenty of bottles of drink so its possible to create your own cocktail. …",5,December 2017,

The quality of the accommodation, restaurants and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff is excellent. The service in the Valley Wing is exceptional. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Even the booking process was smooth and easy.   I laughed when I read reviews from people suggesting children should be banned from the Valley Wing (as though some sort of illicit substance). The way the staff treat families and young children are what sets this place apart. Kids enjoy feeling a bit special too.

I had just flown in from Thailand and was sick, but throughout the night it got worse to the point i was bed ridden, the staff arranged a doctor for me that hands down was the best doctor i have ever met, within 24 hours he visited the hotel 3 times for a check up and I had gone from bed ridden to almost 100%, without his help, and the help of the staff I would of been stuck in bed for days. i couldn't be thankful enough to the Dr and staff and Shangri La Valley Wing.

5 Star Beginning,Edward C,We began our month-long visit to S.E. Asia with a stay at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore.  It met and exceeded our expectations.  1. The service was warm and beyond accommodating.  Special shout out to Lorielle and Cory Ann part of the front desk staff the met our needs superbly and consistently.  2. We enjoyed breakfast at Line Buffet every morning.  3.  Book the Garden Rooms if possible.  4. Pool staff (Ramesh especially) are on it.  Be sure to claim loungers early. 5.

Return since the Upgrade 2018,juddyburton,"First visit here since the recent upgrade of the Horizon club and a number of other upgrades including the lobby lounge.  The Shangri-LA have done a excellent job at upgrading the hotel, it was well overdue. Now time for some feed back from our 5 day stay.  From the collection at the airport in the Hotel Mercedes ( and very nice it was and the driver was too ) to the check in at the Horizon club nothing to fault their. The rooms are far better than last time, and we really liked the new style. They do however seem smaller and the positioning of the bed at a angle was little strange. Other than that room service was 100% the cleaning girls 100% also. The new Horizon club is a vast improvement and a great new layout.

Why can they not use the smart phone entry. saw it in a cheap hotel in sydney, it works every time. Tap stay.

One of the Better Staycations We Have Had,MelvinLin,"This was one of the better hotel stays we have had locally.   Our stay got off to a bright start. Hilary, Carol, and Nurul, who helped us with the check in, were all friendly and helpful, and went out of their ways to make sure we were comfortably settled down in the room. With two young children with us, their efforts made a big difference to us.   We stayed in the new family suite, and it was great. The setup in the room visibly pleased the older child, and kept her entertained for many hours. There were also amenities in the suite which were useful for the demographics of the clients it is intended to serve.

People are just... wonderful. Everyone of them.,mytrystwithangkorwat,"I asked the driver of the car. You look so happy. He said 'what is there in life to feel sad about, Sir'. I was wonder struck.

And to top it all, the turning at the beginning of Orange grove Road into This lovely Hotel sends a very positive signal into one's heart. And mind.

Another fine stay,Rob P,"I previously stayed at the Shangri La in Bangkok and was amazed by the comfort, quality of my room and the staff’s attention to detail.  The Singapore property offered more of the same. Lots to choose from in terms of restaurants, magnificent premises surrounded by beautiful gardens, etc. The buffet breakfast was fantastic in terms of quality and selection.  My only complaint is that the bed in my room (Garden Wing) rolled away from the headboard when I leaned against it, which made reading a book and answering emails in bed a bit frustrating.

On arrival the hotel, I was greeted by a very friendly and professional staff member who took me straight to the room and checked me in there. I thought that was a fantastic touch. The room itself was immaculate, spacious and had a nice sized balcony to relax on in that glorious Singapore heat! (having come from a cold and wet London!).

"Great hotel, great location",Stashu25,This is a very nice hotel. I upgraded to the Valley Wing and I highly recommend doing so. The rooms are very large (you can ask to see one before committing) and the lobby is very quiet. They have a lovely room where they serve a fantastic breakfast buffet.

"Valley wing, perfect",peterbainbridge2018,"It's difficult to know where to start. The room, the lobby, both staff and appearance, waiting staff, food, the room (again) and the grounds. All of these were just about perfect. Breakfast was great, both choice and quality. The only downside of the holiday was that as we were only there for 3 days we didn't get the opportunity to sample all of the breakfast locations available.  In case it sounds like I have rose tinted spectacles, one oddity. There were crumbs on the bedroom floor when we moved in. They were still there when we left.

Parts of it has recently been refurbished and look great. The swimming pool is super and great for kids.  My only complaint would be the pool bar which is a bit scruffy looking and with service which is not up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. Chairs and cushions are dirty and it’s not an inviting place to have a meal.   We stayed in the Valley wing, which is worth the extra cost as everything is included. Breakfast, afternoon tea and champagne every day as much as you want. The room was amazing, large and comfortable.

Xmas dinner wasn't great. Just a regular buffet with many guests wearing shorts and T shirts, while I donned a suit! Paled into insignificance compared with the Mandarin in KL. 4. New Year's Eve party with live music was very good. 5. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. 6. It's a short walk from Orchard Road, with the ION Metro and Tangling. I walked loads overall to see the sights and earn breakfast! 7. Gym was exceptional and the…",5,December 2017,
Excellent luxury hotel,Christina V,"We stayed for three nights in a newly renovated (May 2017) Horizon Grand Premier room which was perfect for us. There is a small kitchen area, a large table and sofa, a desk, a day bed, a walk-in closet and a very big king sized bed. We were 2 adults, 2 children and an infant. The check-in was amazing with the head of housekeeping welcoming us and offering us a stroller and a diaper disposal bin for the baby. The hotel is just beautiful with an impressive lobby, a great pool area, a beautiful garden, an outdoor play area for kids (that our older kids loved) and several good restaurants. Since we stayed in a Horizon room we had access to the Horizon lounge on the 24th floor for breakfast, afternoon tea and drinks and canapes. This was very nice and peaceful instead of having…",5,January 2018,
Luxury Oasis in city jungle,Kristina D,"We stayed in the hotel over festive period (New Years Eve) and really enjoyed it.  From the moment we walked in to the hotel we were taken to an enjoyable journey. Smooth check-in/check out.  Nicely designed room, especially liked the dressing table, very clean.  We really enjoyed the lounge in the lobby, beautiful design and atmosphere, live music band, nicely composed menu with local specialities (chili crab is a must).  New Years eve party was amazing, the mood was festive from the morning, when we saw all the preparations, happy staff, followed by the great night with lots of dance. Kids club was not opened yet, but they expect it in Jan. However we found the concierge service found it a bit difficult to recommend places for dinner in town. I would highly recommend Shangri…",5,December 2017,
"Really is Shangri-la , an oasis of calm, relaxation and indulgence ",ALiscoop,Excellent experience as it has been on previous visits. Staff so welcoming and really look out for anything that they can do to help your stay. Friendly pool staff and blissful foot massage whilst at the pool. Spa good and relaxing. Just missed the oysters and prawns that we’d previously enjoyed at the superb Line breakfast. This truly is an oasis of calm in the busyness of Singapore.,5,December 2017,

From the friendly welcoming staff to the impeccable food and drink.

Please get rid of the kids in the Valley Wing!,kimrealestate,"Love, love, loved the room, the service and the beautiful grounds.  The Valley Wing proves that a properly designed and maintained hotel (this one from the 80’s) from any decade is timeless. So many thoughtful conveniences in the room and very friendly and accommodating staff.    Regretfully we did not know that the “no kids” policy had been abandoned at the Valley Wing.  Families with scads of unruly and noisy kids dominated and ruined the experience in the Lobby during both of our stays - before and after a cruise.  This is no place for small children.  I think that a policy of 12 years old and above in the Valley Wing should not be too much to expect.  I don’t understand why the parents of loud kids want to be in such a staid environment.....they get dirty looks and the kids…",4,January 2018,

Breakfast was a great spread to cater for every palette with the Hostess remembering our name each morning! Great breakfast service with no complaints, the best pastries and egg!  A special mention to Concierge Johnny who recommended the best Chilli Crab we have ever tasted ever! Thanks to his care, we enjoyed our stay immensely and saw the best Singapore has to offer in the time we had (Little India, Arab Street, Gardens by the Bay, Senotosa) as well as relaxing by the pool, even though getting up at 7am to save a good pool bed was recommended by the Lifeguard :) Overall cannot fault the attentiveness of the…",5,December 2017,
Return visit but .....,Simplylife14,"This was our first return after major renovation that completed in mid 2017. We stayed in Garden Wing which is not renovated. The private of Garden Wing is no longer there but the staff at main desk were nice and professional. First disappointed experience started when he informed that the Waterfall cafe closed due to low occupancy. This show that the hotel is interested in their bottom line more than what the customers want. The breakfast at Waterfall gave the peaceful experience and more attention to guests than at The Line. In my view, if it is the standard, it has to be there in whatever the hotel occupancy is. This is a short change of promise! The housekeeping standard for our room was poor and can see dust in many areas. Shang Palace has improved the food quality with its…",3,December 2017,

The hotel itself has excellent facilities, beautiful grounds and pool area, and is quiet but within walking distance of the main shopping areas. The refurbished rooms in the Tower Wing are very nice. This stay was memorable as the staff welcoming us - Carol Peng and others - were extremely kind and efficient, and put a congratulations note and carrot cake in our room upon arrival - it was our wedding anniversary. All the front desk staff (including the ever-smiling Cory) were helpful, and the concierges were really knowledgeable - thanks Johnny, Ono and others.

Sublime Week at the Shangri-La Singapore 2017,pvoscott,"Cory & Lorielle we so gracious and made our stay very special over Christmas 2017. The accommodations were perfect, the pool area a welcome respite after a day of exploring this remarkable city. Ramesh at the pool is the host extraordinaire taking care of your every need.  Everything about the Shangri-La was perfect. We felt so welcomed at our home away from home in one of the best locations in Singapore, just 2 blocks from the heart of Orchard Road, yet secluded from its frenetic energy. The Shangri-La is a perfect refuge from this vibrant city after a day of shopping or exploring this multicultural island state.

Wedding weekend steeped in attention at the Valley Wing,Aznan_Wanderlust,"Stayed with a whole bunch of family and a few of us opted for the Valley Wing and more than a week before our stay, the Valley Wing manager was already taking care of us. I was going to be staying with my mom who was particular about her religious dietary meals and i was concerned about the  many meal options from the afternoon tea to the breakfast, how we were going to cope and the manager delivered on everyone of my concerns. The attention that we got during our 3 day stay was nothing short of special and people just seemed to know what and when we needed things. The only dip in my experience was when they insisted that i took my cocktail outside just because my leather sandals were not covered - and of course i must say that my sandals looked nicer on my feet than the some of…",5,November 2017,

They quickly changed us to the one bedroom suite at the garden wing. Melisa from horizon club guest service and a tall Korean lady from front desk were really helpful to help escort us to view the room and even sent the charger which I left in the previous room to us. We were impressed by their services. They can't do enough to make us feel better. We had our breakfast at line which offer one of the most extensive spread I've seen.

As always wonderful to stay at the Shangri-La,nota1timetraveller,"First time here at the Shangri-La in Singapore and we were not disappointed. We stayed in newly renovated rooms which were a bit small but are not as old fashioned as some of the Shangri-La Hotels. The smell is the same ( I love it!!) Unfortunately our room was not so clean. I found black hare here and there ( bed, chair, shower) and the back of the door was very dirty.  The lobby is nice, serves cake in the afternoon, snacks in the evening and some wonderful drinks from the bar. We were not able to make a reservation at the Italian restaurant :-(  Breakfast was plentiful. BUT: we we were sitting outside because it was very noisy and crowded inside.

Great weekend getaway,juzatourist,"The weekend stay was booked last minute - yet the reservations staff were able to assist and help with our special requests (for a firmer bed and extra pillows) - extra points for service.   The room in the refreshed Tower Wing was what you'd expect at a 5-star establishment and did not disappoint amenities wise. To nit pick, the apples in the room had probably been there for a while and were a little squishy - needless to say we gave them a miss.  The pool has a ton of deck chairs so you have no problem finding one - unless you insist on a pool view. The organic free-form pool is also large enough to accommodate the young swimmers and more serious ones.

She kindly offer to send our luggages up to the room, including a Christmas gift I got for my partner which was a designer potted plant wrapped in a paper bag. Leaving our stuff at the check-in counter unattended, she escorted us up to the lounge.

Breakfast at The Line was fabulous too with many choices and I have to totally forget about my diet. We also enjoyed swimming in the pool but felt the water was not that clean and clear that day. On the 1st day, not sure if there were any problems with their lifts as out of 5 lifts in Tower Wing, only 2 seem to be working and we have to queue and waited for a long time to go up to our floor.

Great service and location,Kebuh,"Located a short 10 minute walk from Orchard Road, I enjoy this hotel as it is located in an upscale residential neighbourhood so you don't really realise how close you are to the main shopping area of Singapore. Being tropical, it can be a bit warm to walk to Orchard Road but there is tree cover for most of the way. Before arriving at ShangriLa, check which block you will be staying at, Tower, Garden or Valley as that will dictate which area the taxi will drop you off at. All are interconnected but where you get dropped off at will dictate how long a walk you have.  I was originally booked into the Garden Wing, which is nice as every room has an outside  balcony but was upgraded to the Valley Wing which does not have a balcony but has a more old world feel about it.

Stopover before holiday,wigglyline,This was not our first stay at one of this group hotel and we were very pleased to see that the standard was consistent to what we remember. Location is ideal as it is only a short walk to Orchard Road shopping area which is excellent. We found a lot of the shops were below ground on several levels and it is quite easy to become disorientated.

We love the attention showered on us the minute we stepped into the lobby for the check-in until we reached our rooms. The Garden Wing rooms were of good size with a pool view on the room balcony. We were surrounded by greenery. Yes, I know infinity pool is the fashion. But this is one of the few hotels that has a big swimming pool on the ground floor. The beds were comfortable. Rooms were clean. Breakfast's spread is big. Too bad, my limited capacity couldn't savor everything. The Line was really crowded in the morning for breakfast.

Equally impressive the club lounge's ambience and layout and foods being served during breakfast, high tea and evening cocktail. Also glad to hear that club lounge is operating 24 hours except no concierge after midnight.

An absolute favourite,christophermfromaus,The Shangri-La hotel in Singapore is a landmark hotel in Singapore.  It’s very large footprint means it has the largest space of any hotel for its facilities.  The buffet is the largest and best of any hotel in Singapore and is an experience in itself.  Thank god for the huge and well equipped gym facility otherwise we’d all get very fat from the food honestly the best hotel gym in singapore.  The rooms are well sized and the there are several towers with different configurations.  Valley tower is my favourite and they work very hard to please ... a second home in Singapore.,5,November 2017,
A little oasis in the city,Chrisg5,Fabulous weekend staycation in the Garden Wing. Lovely room with big well appointed balcony.

Such a Disappointment - The New Shangri La Lobby,Pia L,"After more than a decade being a regular guest a the Shangri La, what a disappointment to see the old lobby being revamped for the worse on many aspects: choice of cuisine is now mostly ""local"" and offers cheapest cookies, overall ambience, heterogenous cheap looking furniture, beautiful china replaced with some basic tableware - just every aspect is a form of deterioration.   Why do we need a bread-shop (!) in a 5-star lobby and there is not hotel boutique anymore? Even the uniform of the staff is harsh on the eyes, the off colours and standardised cheap ""jewellery""..what an aesthetically and displeasing experience!

A letter of complaint.,Alistair W,"Dear Sir or Madam,  I am writing to you today to express my disappointment with our one night stay at Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore.   We knew Singapore was the original Shangri-La Hotel and because of the history, and having stayed or eaten at other Shangri-La Hotels (Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and London), we decided to stretch our budget and book a room for our final night in Asia. My issues are:  •	We waited over ten minutes to check-in and we were not even acknowledged. •	Check-in was friendly but slow for a 1 night stay (24/11/17). •	Twice my partner ordered Cabernet Sauvignon (Red) and was bought Sauvignon Blanc (White). Mistakes happen, but the staff were argumentative and rude. •	When it rained we took shelter outside the Waterfall restaurant. The cushions were taken away…",2,November 2017,
"Deprived & disgruntled: Horrid, insulting & disrespectful ",Joseph R,"Shangri-La hotel, apparently inspired by the James Hilton book (Lost Horizon) is meant to be an oasis, nestled in the rushed and busy Orchard Road area. It should offer a calm, relaxing, reinvigorating experience, all laden with that extra touch of luxury. Its rooms are nicely appointed, the Garden Wing (one of the three wings) has nice balconies to stand and soak in the views of the pool and the gorgeously landscaped gardens, and one can hear the man-made waterfall that cascades down to the restaurants. We meander through the steps hidden amongst this waterfall, our path leading to a pond with tortoises and fish galore, all rushing towards us with their mouths open, as if needing much required feed. The reaction of the fish pretty much sums up our ""romantic special occasion""…",1,December 2017,
Very impressive,HomerNottingham,"I’m not sure how anyone cannot give this place 5 stars, from brilliant door men, to welcoming reception staff (who show you to your room). Fantastic breakfast options and quite a few restaurants around the building.  Room was massive and staff really worked hard to keep it clean and tidy ",5,November 2017,
Absolutely superb,Ian S,"Stayed 3 nights, predominantly as a break and a chance to see Singapore on our way back from New Zealand to England, and left wishing we had given ourselves longer. Arrived on a Saturday evening to a very busy hotel, due to a St. Andrews night celebration and were advised our room had been upgraded from Tower wing to Valley wing! Breakfast Sunday morning initially appeared very chaotic, with a long queue waiting to be shown to their table. Fears quickly disappeared, however, as the staff are extremely efficient and we were quickly shown to our table. Choice of many cuisines, reflecting the different influences in Singapore. Valley wing is brilliant, with it's own reception, lounge and entrance away from the rest of the hotel, will be booking this when we come back.  All staff…",5,November 2017,

The room smelled damp the whole 3 days we were there my opinion it had not be used for a while or the air-conditioning had not properly been serviced 2/.Very cheap toilet paper which disintegrates on use  3/. Though we paid the extra for the horizon floor and the use of the horizon lounge you have to help yourself totes and coffee, normally you are asked what your preference THIS IS A FIRST FOR IN MY EXPERIENCE WHEN STAYING IN A HORIZON ROOM 4/.

Great Hotel - great staff,EMS1510,"We visited during November and were immediately welcomed to the hotel. We had booked the Valley Wing and were shown our room which was old style but sill clean and neat. We were also given an orchid on arrival alongside champagne. The plus side of the Valley wing was that drinks and food were liberally offered. However, the hotel shares with the garden wing and the tower wing and the swimming pool serves all three areas. The pool area reminded me of something from Spain and we were not that impressed. People had left towels on the sun loungers to hold the spaces which was ridiculous for a hotel of this calibre to allow.  We enjoyed the breakfast and service was friendly and attentive. It was a shame it was rainy season as we would  have wished to enjoy the pool area (where free)…",4,November 2017,

A wonderful hotel,karori12,"We had three nights here enroute to NZ from UK.  After the 13 hour flight it was an absolute delight to be welcomed as we alighted from our car, then handed over to a customer services representative who handled our registration.  We were then taken to our suite and shown the facilities.  We were upgraded to a garden balcony room with a view of the lovely pool and gardens.  The room and facilities were excellent.  However the level of customer care from all staff  throughout our stay was exceptional.  The Shangri la is recommended as a hotel to stay at.  ",5,November 2017,
Beautiful Singapore Retreat,Michael F,"If there's one you can say about the Shangri-La chain of the hotels is that they never fail to impress and Shangri -La Singapore is no different  The impressive lobby takes your breath away as soon as you step into the hotel The Pool and gardens are just beautiful and what I loved is despite being in the middle of a fast paced busy city you feel like your on a island resort. I stayed at the newly refurbished Tower Wing but had the opportunity to look at the rooms in the Garden and Valley Wings, All 3 are very different in their own way but you wont be disappointed which ever one you choose. Great Hotel , Great facilities , Great service you wont be disappointed!",5,October 2017,
Excellent stay and warm people,Anitaglobe,"Arrival was very warm and welcoming, caring staff, very clean lobby, passageway and rooms, hotel’s ambience awesome with lovely fragrance of freshness as we entered.

Simply The Best,Paul D,Stayed over for a few days on route to Australia and didn't want to leave. Perfect location for the main shopping area.

If possible stay in a suite in the garden tower.,5,November 2017,
Shangri-La Hotel Singapore,Michael S,Great place for stay. Breakfast buffet selection is the best I have ever seen and I've stayed in many countries and hotels! The pool is like being on a tropical Island and rooms are just fantastic. Highly recommended though it's not cheap.....will be going back there next April.,5,November 2017,
Didn't Dissapoint,Milo R,Being my first time in singapore and my first time at Shangri-La property it lived up to expectations!  There a few moans on here about refurbishments however you are given ample notice and realistically we were out all day exploring singapore so it didnt bother us.  We were on the 18th floor so got an amazing view of the city. The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest MRT which again was quite a nice walk however taxis are plentiful and the average cost to the shopping centre was about 7SGD.  Being a travel agent i will recommend to all my customers and would love to stay again.  Many thanks!!!,5,November 2017,
Best part of the trip,Ramsum,Been in shangri-la for 4 days and loved each and everyone of it. Out of the 4 days I had to eat out on one day and that was a mistake. The food is delicious. The room was cosy and came with a view. Room service was prompt. Housekeeping excellent. Thank you for being a home away from home.,5,November 2017,
Superb Hotel in beautiful gardens,lisandchris2015,This hotel is very well managed. The staff  are very attentive and helpful and everything is done with good grace.The lobby and bar areas are spectacular.

Excellent place,129natalie,A most wonderful place to stay at. Definitely would stay there again. Service was excellent and hotel was very clean. It is walking distance from the centre. Although I didn’t swim but swimming pool looked amazing. They seemed to do water aerobics in the morning for who ever wanted to join in. There were restaurants and coffee shops in the hotel to suit individual needs. Truly loved the place .,5,November 2017,
Lousy Concierge with no sense of customer service,YZ Lim,"Shangri La had never failed me in all the countries that I had stayed with them but this was totally disappointing!   I was celebrating my wedding anniversary and my wife birthday yesterday at Chi Spa. We had a 1.5 hour massage which I partially paid via my Golden Circle points. After paying the final bill at Chi, I requested for a complimentary car park coupon which I was given one by the Spa counter.   Then when we were exiting the car park, the complimentary ticket machine read my coupon as expired. I took a closer look and it was indeed expired 2 days ago. Hence i parked my car and headed to the concierge at the lobby instead of going all the way down to the Chi Spa which was 2 floors down  However, I was totally shocked by Mr Rajagopal Rajkumar (Chef Concierge) who refused…",1,November 2017,
Old business hotel,Regqueen,"I don't like the scent of the lotion, shampoo and conditioner. I remember the room I stayed is average, small and dim. The highlight is the bar on top floor of the hotel. The hotel is located in a residential area and there's no shops around the hotel.",3,December 2016,
Amazing stay in Singpore,notebookandcamera,"We opted to stay at the Shangri-La Singapore for a few days at the end of a cruise.The hotel was just the haven we needed after a hectic trip.

A shuttle bus operates between the hotel and the shopping venues in Orchard Road, although it is an easy walk if you prefer. A truly stunning location.",5,November 2017,
beautiful hotel...,Susana,"stayed there for 2 nights, nice room but a bit small, maybe because it's a corner room. great breakfast, plenty of foods serve on the breakfast. did not try the swimming pool, but looked quite big with resort style pool.  over all, its a a pleasant stay, although a bit far from MRT station, but the hotel provide free shuttle bus every hour to orchard  and takashimaya.",5,November 2017,

Terrible stay after hoping for a relaxing break. ",2,November 2017,
Is this the best hotel I have ever stayed in?,Euston33,"My wife and I stayed for a mini-break and were blown away. It is like a resort hotel in the middle of the city and beautifully renovated.

But the gem was the Horizon Club lounge on 24th floor, fabulous personalised breakfast and stupendous canapés in the evening. Cannot be faulted and I definitely go there again.",5,November 2017,
Wow wow wow,Deborah D,As usual shangri la hotel did not disappoint. Nothing is too much trouble. Setting and quality of finish great. Only downside was it was a bit of a walk to nearest train station. However taxis were readily available too. Relaxing and even given some beautiful flowers shame I could not take them to our next destination in New Zealand ( bio rules). The cakes in reception are a work of art see Spider-Man here and tasted delicious too.,5,October 2017,

Average,Ravi_Mohabir,I have been to many nice hotels and along with other Shangri-La's. This felt like an older hotel that is not being up kept. Room was small and just average. There was construction happening while we were there  from 9am-6pm and a lot of drilling so if you were in your room it was not peaceful.  The service made up for the average room as everyone greeted us and helped make our stay great. It was my birthday and the left a cake with 2 Tiger beers in the room which was an awesome surprise.,3,October 2017,
Excellant Hotel,Peter M,"Stayed here with my partner for 4 days en route from Australia to the UK. Greeted cordially on arrival and escorted to reception. Check in was quick and friendly. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. No noise disturbance at night. There is a buffet breakfast in the restaurant. There were plenty of choices both European and Asian and the food quality was very good. We found the bar offered a reasonable selection of meals  which worked out a lot cheaper than the restaurant in the evenings. The staff were all professional, courteous and friendly. All we spoke to were fluent in English. The hotel is located in a quiet area within easy walking distance of the famous Orchard Road shopping area. If choosing to walk, it is very hot in Singapore so ensure you take water with you -…",5,October 2017,

Valley Wing: one of the best hotels!,CruiseSeason,"After almost one year of constantly forgetting to leave a review, here finally our take on our wonderful stay in December 2016. We stayed for 2 nights in the Valley Wing (booked the Valley Wing Splendor package) and were a little concerned about the Tower Wing renovations that took place at the time we were there...impact on other wings, closed areas, more guest in the Valley Wing to accomodate Tower Wing guests, etc. Before we arrived the Valley Wing senior staff put us at ease and asked if we were celebrating something special, which he did, our wedding anniversary. Imagine our great surprise as my wife was greeted with a beautiful flower bouquet on arrival of the hotel limousine transfer!

Not as great as previous stays,Mummydolphin,I have stayed here a few times over the years and usually have nothing but rave reviews. This stay had me in a room where there was a sewer smell in the corridor. They even put a large atomiser in the corridor to try and decrease the smell. There was no note or apology given for the smell. It was a nauseating smell. The breakfast was as good as always.,3,July 2017,
Short stay,mattnat2017,Had a short stay for work. Room was very clean and comfortable. Forgot to bring swimmers - ugh - as the pool looked very inviting. Bring an appetite as there are so many breakfast options at the buffet! Staff super polite all of the time.,5,September 2017,

Shangri-la Hotel Singapore,Tookives,The staff in this hotel were exceptionally helpful and friendly. Our room was well designed and the bed was very comfortable. A short (but hot) walk to the shopping on Orchard Road. The hotel runs a free shuttle bus every hour to the shopping and subway station. A convenient way to deal with not being within a close walking distance to the subway. A 10 minute walk to the Botanic Gardens (but you may want to save your energy and take a taxi in the heat). The property is beautifully landscaped with an outdoor pool.,5,October 2017,

The reception staff made us feel at home and were helpful with every request. The Valley Wing staff were wonderful especially Carlio (Valley Wing waiter) but on occasion the staff were slow. It also, at times, seemed difficult to cater for a child who is a fussy eater eg we wanted to order hot chips into the Valley Wing afternoon tea/cocktail hour and were not able to... however the room service kids Bento Box was wonderful especially for this fussy eater and would recommend it!

I chose the Shangri-La and was not disappointed. The room was well-proportioned and quiet. There was an adequate bar in the room if you chose to have a $15 martini or $9 Snickers bar LOL. Then again the $12 beer in the lobby lounge was a little overpriced too. The espresso coffee machine the room was free and a nice treat. There were also plenty of electric outlets for use. In the hallway, I thought it was interesting there were fresh apples everyday just as you got on the elevator. The bar in the lobby had a live entertainer singing each night.

Impressions,Georgevich,In more recent times I consistently choose to stay at the Shangri-La in Singapore for business and family holidays. Set on spacious grounds with much greenery it is an ideal setting to hold a business meeting or relax with the family. Whilst the main tower wing has recently been completely renovated I prefer staying in the more tranquil setting of the garden wing. Rooms are generous in size and overlook a small garden. Service levels are consistently high. The gym and wet area is a favourite. Gym is large and well equipped for all types of workouts. The Shangri-La in Singapore remains my first preference when visiting Singapore.,5,October 2017,

Breakfast was included but we didn’t realise that drinks, high tea, canapés & drinks were included, a very nice surprise. Breakfast was excellent we tried eggs, lobster & caviar, again the choice is superb.

Plenty of variety with restaurants and poolside catering.

World Class,Alan S,"We hadn't stayed at the Shangri La for five years but going back was like renewing old acquaintances. Check in at the Horizon Club was smooth and the female staff are very welcoming. Evening drinks and canapes is very popular while the breakfast caters for all tastes. The Tower wing of the hotel has recently been renovated. We had never walked through the grounds on previous stays but this time we had a thorough look around. Don't miss the Orchid ""house"". Beautifully kept surroundings and larger than we thought. Only problem was we had to change rooms to get one with good bench space for our cases which open out like a book.

Brief but perfect,judithclark,"Spent a couple of days at the Shangri-La last week while on business in Singapore.

Suffice to say the service mirrors the beautiful ambience and it’s rare to say the service was faultless - simply put, nothing was too much trouble and the staff were excellent.

Shangri-la's Towering Wing In Singapore,Akala,"He came, he saw, he stayed and this is how it went down....  The story of Shangri-la is probably quite well known, based on the iconic 1930's novel penned by James Hilton, called Lost Horizon. In the story, a disparate group of people find themselves stranded in a fictional sanctuary called Shangri-la. It is here that the lead character finds inner peace, love and a sense of purpose in this most mysterious of utopias, whose inhabitants are permanently happy and enjoy unheard-of longevity.  This sense of longevity can almost certainly be applied to the Shangri-la Singapore as it is the luxury hotel chain's first property, opened all the way back in 1971 and is an anchor of the Shangri-la hospitality experience world wide. Visiting a five star hotel is always exciting and it is…",5,August 2017,

Wonderful,pjc97,"Arrived, exhausted, at the hotel at 6am to be told that our room would not be ready for at least another 4 hours as the hotel was very busy, not the best of starts.  Also, slightly disappointing, was the fact that the main entrance was undergoing renovation, so had to make do with a small entrance and reception area. When the work is finished, it will look very imposing, took a peek behind the screening ! However, when were finally got to our room we were more than happy with it. It was spacious, clean and tidy, although the view was not the best, we had the biggest balcony ever.  Overall, the staff were efficient and spoke excellent English and the hotel was spotless.  We were on a B&B basis and the buffet was the largest I have ever seen, catering for all tastes and all…",5,May 2017,

Fabulous Customer Service,joannross0,"What fabulous customer service we received while stay in the Valley Wing at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore.  From the meet and greet at the airport to the arrival at the hotel they made you feel like you so welcome that it set a prestige of our whole vacation.  So relaxing and enjoyable, we never had to ask for anything.  After a day or so the staff knew what one preferred and whatever it may have been it was waiting for us. Looking forward to our stay at the Shangri-La in London over Christmas",5,October 2017,
The Very Best of Singapore- 5 well deserved stars!!,Message4Melanie,"This hotel is outstanding in every way.  It is an urban oasis- beautifully landscaped and elegantly decorated.  Thoughtful touches, fabulous amenities, excellent service- all expected of this grand hotel- but it the amazing staff that makes the difference!    We were in Singapore for the Formula 1 Grand Prix- staying at the lovely Shangri-La for 6 glorious days.  Arguably this event is perhaps brings the largest crowds to Singapore filling all of the city's top hotels, restaurants and venues, however the staff at the Shangri-La made us feel like we were the only guests.  We never stood in line, they answered the phone on the first ring when we called for anything with the staff often reaching out to us offering help before we could ask. They anticipated every need and tended to…",5,September 2017,
When only The Best will do!,Dips2910,"Our 2nd stay in the Valley Wing of Shangri La Singapore was even better than the first .

A memorable & a wonderful stay !!,KSPKPakki,"We stayed at Shangri La hotel on my visit to Singapore. We booked a room in Valley wing. There are three wings namely Tower wing, Garden Wing & Valley Wing. Out of this three Valley wing is the toppest & costlier than the rest. The service provided by the hotel was excellent, they address to the smallest issue of yours very politely. I had breakfast at the Line restaurant, the food was very good. They have a big swimming pool, a small water fall(created), Chi Spa, A Gym & a big vast lawn to laze around with good open bars.  The room was big & spacious, they had provided free wifi throughout the hotel, you can connect to wifi where ever you are in the hotel.

Truly amazing,rezapmd123,It was a great experience for me and my wife to stay 3 nights at this fabulous Hotel. It's 20  minutes walk from the famous orchard St. A truly five star experience. The breakfast was awesome. The bed was super comfy and the staff were very kind and attending.,5,September 2017,
Superb hotel with friendly service staff,Joe K,"The staff are very friendly. We were warmly greeted & welcomed in the lobby area by one of the friendliest service advisors by the name of Peter (with glasses) . He made our stay by taking the time to talk to us & finding out what we wanted to experience whilst on holidays in Singapore.   Being our first day, we must have looked a bit lost as to where everything in the hotel was.    Peter personalized our experience by actually walking us up to the horizon club on level 24 to show us the facilities there & then giving each of our 2 children a bottle of fresh juice each from the bar fridge. We were simply amazed at this service!  Over the course of our 7-8 day stay, whenever Peter saw us, he would always greet us with a smile and see how we were doing.  On two different…",5,October 2017,
Unbelievable again!,Anna B,"We stayed here at Easter and then came here again for a special birthday celebration. This hotel never disappoints - all the staff are amazingly friendly and helpful, the rooms and facilities are wonderful and spotless and we will be back!! The location is also only a few mins walk to the top of Orchard Rd. The coffee shop in the lobby offers a great selection of bakery and coffee takeaways. All the staff were wonderful but a special mention goes to Rosili who works in the gym (hope I have spelt his name correctly) - so friendly and helpful. Thank you all at Shangri-la, I had an awesome birthday! We will be back!!",5,October 2017,
The Very Best!,WestAussiePerth,"My wife and I had the opportunity to return to this beautiful hotel for 3 nights recently.

The suite was very clean with all the amenities you would need.The beds are very large and comfortable with beautiful linen.The bathrooms had Aqua di Parma toiletries which were great. There was a fruit bowel provided along with biscuits to go with your tea or coffee and little chocolates. All of these were checked and replenished regularly.

Beautiful Hotel,Claire S,"Charming staff, Buffet the best in town.  Rooms have everything a traveller could want. A sumptuous place to stay.  It’s not cheap ! The only thing that didn’t thrill me was the noise at the pool. Plenty of noisy children during our stay which isn’t conducive to peace and quiet.  ",5,October 2017,
Fabulous as always!,Rachel E,"Our first visit since the renovation, will admit first impressions, not great! But this was a personal thing. (We loved the old) After advice from Management we left our opinion until we had truly looked! After our third walk through, we get it! It is a beautiful space and everyone involved should be very proud of the outcome.  Another lovely holiday at the Shangri-la Singapore 🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺",5,October 2017,
Great all round hotel.,Tanyasanders1990,"There is a lot of business travellers throughout the hotel, we stayed in the tower wing which seemed to accommodate more for business travellers, would recommend upgrading to the garden wing if you are staying for leisure. Service is as you would expect from a 5 star hotel, it was my birthday during our stay and they left a complimentary birthday cake and bottle of wine for us for when we returned home from the day! Breakfast was of a good standard, swimming pool is a very good size! Overall good hotel for a 2 night stay in Singapore! ",5,October 2017,
Attention to detail,Kroezetravel,"This hotel is after hospitality at it's best. The staff are very friendly and will go to great length to provide you with anything you're after. The garden wing rooms are very spacious and have a nice lay-out. The hotel caters for large groups too and are known to host conferences without other guests actually noticing the uplift in visitors. In the rooms it is very quite, you have no idea is the rooms next, above or under yours are occupied or not.",5,July 2017,
Short stay,Thomas F,"Stayed only for 1 night. The hotel lived up to the name and fame. Beatiful room, huge pool in the garden, excotic flowers everywhere. Bathroom is huge and well equiped. They offer a free shuttle service every 20 minutes the bus takes you all the way to downtown main shopping area. Will use the hotel again in the future.",5,January 2017,
Seriously impressed,Lisa C,"I have just returned from a business trip on which I was fortunate to stay in this beautiful hotel.  I have stayed in many great hotels over my life but there were a few things about this one that elevated it above most.  They might seem a bit random but here they are: 1.  Power points - they were everywhere in my room - in the desk, by the bed on both sides, and extra as well as USB points.  So tired of hotels without enough points to charge my devices. 2. Master light switches - proper ones that operated all of the lights - no getting up to turn off a desk lamp 3.  A soap dish - minor grumble I know but many hotels don't provide a soap dish for the counter.  This one did.  Thank you. 4.  Floral displays in the public areas - just gorgeous and very interesting.  Love the huge…",5,September 2017,
Stunning Elegance,KatParry,"My husband and I return here every time we visit Singapore.We are always drawn back here rather than try anywhere else and have never been disappointed. The hotel is breathtakingly beautiful, the grounds an array of colorful exotic plants and trees. From the moment we arrive at the Valley wing our stay is five star all the way. Beautiful spacious rooms with immaculate decor, it is impossible to find fault. We last came in April 2017 so sorry for a delay in my review!  Every afternoon they serve afternoon tea then a little later canapes. My champagne glass is always full thanks to the wonderful staff who go above and beyond to ensure our stay is most memorable. In particular I would like to thank Raja, Jergan, Elisabeth and Hari for taking such great care of us. Little things…",5,April 2017,
Truly Blissful,JJ Steven,"Shangri-La Hotels never disspoints, the Paris Shangri-La, Jakarta, Bosphorus, Tokyo, Sentosa, Surabaya, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, I've tried quite a number of them, and this Singapore one sticks out as the top 3, after Tokyo and Paris. The serenity, the tranquility, the nice ambience, the beautifully decorated gorgeous yet grand interiors, the scent of the rooms-hallways-lobby, the level of staff's dedication and level of food choices and quality (especially the lobster barbecue-my favourite), have always been beyond expectation. I would always at any given time, recommend Shangri-La Singapore. The only backdrop for all this greatness, is that the Loyalty Program doesn't meet the high standard as the hotel property and services offered. I had a couple of missing stays in the…",5,October 2016,
Fabulous week!,Sue B,"We returned to the Shangri La to celebrate our Silver Wedding.  Had a suite in the renovated tower wing with access to the Horizon club.  We used the Horizon lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks.  All the food was of the highest standard and the level of service was 'above and beyond'.  Particular note must go to Angela who's attention to detail and customer service was fantastic, taking time to talk about our day and share her local knowledge.  We used the ""Line"" restaurant but found it a bit busy - although the food choice and quality was excellent.  The Waterfall restaurant had a lovely ambience with great food.   The pool area was as lovely as we remembered from our last visit, although poolside bar service was a bit slow at times.   We ventured into the…",5,September 2017,
Perfect start to our honeymoon,Michelle Webb,"We stayed for 4 nights and everything was faultless. On arrival we were upgraded to the Valley wing and there were some lovely extras as we were on honeymoon. The breakfast had a large variety and was very high quality.

Nice hotel in a tropical lush setting,JF Milian,"Five nights spent on business. Nice and spacious room with a balcony overlooking a lush garden with birds singing at sunset. Very quiet at night. Small issue with getting two mugs for my teas and coffees on arrival, it took many phone calls. Also switching on and off the various lights in the room is incredibly complicated, one does not know which is which. Nice breakfast but better get there not too late as it is very crowded",4,August 2017,
Returned after 27 years. Still fabulous.,traveljean13,"We stayed at the Shangri-la Hotels in Bangkok and Singapore 27 years ago when we lived in Asia.  We remembered how great they were and decided to stay here during our recent trip to Singapore .   It was as great as it was in our memories.  We stayed in the garden wing, as we did before. It was a tropical getaway from a busy city.  Balconies with bougainvillea overhanging.  Palm trees with a squirrel chattering away. Luxurious rooms. Great service.   We loved the Waterfall restaurant on the first floor.  The food was fabulous.  We ate there 4 times. At the end of a busy day it was the perfect place to relax and get a 5 star meal at a very reasonable price.    The hotel has 3 very distinct wings.  For business, the tower wing or valley wing would be the rightchoice. But if you are…",5,September 2017,

An Oasis,skyecorrina,"We opted to stay here for 2 nights out and 2 nights in on a return trip to Australia and New Zealand. This was our first visit to this hotel.  In December we had a lovely well appointed room with balcony in the Garden Wing which had clearly been updated in the recent past. As ever with this group, the service was impeccable; from the temporary check-in desk( another wing was being upgraded) to the waiting team in the Italian poolside restaurant. On our return in February we were upgraded to the Valley Wing for accommodation but not all the added extras. We found the room on the 2nd visit to be comfortable but we didn't love it so very pleased we didn't book it! The amenities of the hotel are what you should expect from a de-luxe brand - not OTT but definitely luxurious.",4,December 2016,
"Great place to stay, awesome for business",Graeme P,"I stayed for a week in this beautiful resort-style hotel, for business.  The reception on day one was extremely friendly, courteous and professional. Jade was the receptionist on both arrival and departure and did a superb job. In fact, in this hotel you are cared for very well, with staff available everywhere to assist you. Just ask if you need help. The bedroom was spacious and modern. It's clear that renovations were being made, and because of this, it had a very new feel. Large TV, awesome bed, great shower (which I used at least twice daily), and it included all the smaller things that made the stay very nice - bath robes and slippers, well-stocked mini-bar, safe etc. It also has a large outdoor swimming pool. From a business perspective, again we were well catered for. In…",5,September 2017,
Beautiful Luxury Hotel,haroonNV,"Stayed here during a vacation, we booked Horizon Club room in the Tower Wing. The rooms are a mix of classic elegance and luxury, spacious and quiet. The staff kept the room spotless even cleaning again when turning down the bed in the evening.  The breakfast buffet  at ‘The Line” was huge and high quality. So many different cuisines to choose from. Service was great. We love the food at the Shang Palace (Chinese) & Nami (Japanese) restaurant, and at the Waterfall restaurant too.   Only issue is... the location. Not very accessible to the main Orchard shopping area.  All in all, a fabulous stay that have made a memorable experience in beautiful Shangri-la!",5,November 2016,
Family holiday,shimauli,"So we stayed at the Shangrila hotel in singapore from 6-10 September 2017 and honestly the hotel was a big disappointment  The Airport pickup was great , the staff had come all the way to the airplane to pick us up and the car was great with two car seats for the kids which they loved 😍  On reaching the hotel we were escorted to the room within seconds but the room was extremely average and a big disappointment...  Also the email we had received from the hotel and what the hotel staff had been communicated about our reservations were two different things so initially that also had to be sorted..  the front office manager was good and he came and moved us to another bigger room same category which was nicer but I guess all their rooms definitely need a facelift...

Afternoon Tea Darling!,Ed C,Lovely hotel and fab food ....not just cakes and scones it's an all you can eat experience from noodles to really nice Italian cured meats and mozzarella and tomato salad. Throw in a few glasses of something and you have a glorious afternoon treat ...brilliant !!. We had informed the hotel that one of our party was gluten free. When we arrived the head chef walked her around the food available to her and on top had produced a selection of cake and scones just for her.Really nice man we all felt well looked after.

Pretty packaging but lacking substance,Chia1234,"Shangrila- beautiful to uphold after their renovations now serving a hawker styled lunch/ tea Buffett at the lobby lounge.  You get greeted by a coterie of smiling staff who send you to the wrong location! That's ok though...they were trying their best!  The peranakan themed Buffett with pretty nonya porcelain is eye candy. However, the food is lack luster.  The waitresses didn't understand the tea orders- then again they are not local so can't blame them.  I tried the ka Soh fish bee hoon. The toman fish was nicely sliced but had a characteristic muddy taste. No msg detected - a good sign.   My lunch companions decided on the prawn noodle soup but no indication that it was great.

Beautiful Singapore and Fabulous Shangri-la Hotel...a perfect pair!,Jojo D,"For different reasons, this trip to Singapore had been cancelled and rescheduled for so many times until we pushed through with the trip last Sept. 1-4. I have stayed in three different hotels in my previous business trip to Singapore but nothing came close to The Shangdi-la Hotel. It was worth the long wait because we were able to stay in a perfect hotel in Singapore,  It was a perfect because this time I came with my wife for a much needed vacation and stayed in a fabulous hotel.  From the very friendly and accommodating staff and the cool ambience of the lobby, we could see the lashed greenery surrounding the pool.

Perfect as usual!,12Mary70,"What can I say that I haven't said before??  The Shangri-La hotel Singapore is really amazing and it only gets better everytime we stay there.  It's our home away from home. It's the reason we keep going back to Singapore.    I told someone recently, it's "" The Shangri-La Singapore vs The rest of the world "" everytime we are looking for a holiday destination. And The Shangri-La Singapore always wins!  One thing that really stood out this time were the Fantastic 3 (haha, that's how we refer to the lifeguards, Elaine, Bernard and Kesavan). These guys literally save lives on a weekly (if not, daily) basis.  It's baffling how many people get in trouble in the pool, but it's extremely reassuring to see the lifeguards at this hotel coming to the rescue of these unfortunate people.…",5,August 2017,
High Class High Tea!!,nananat2015,"Last Sunday was the last day of my 2 week stay with my family in Singapore, and my daughter-in-law chose the Rose Veranda High Tea at Shangri-La as our farewell time together.   I have never seen anything like it in my life.. it was simply superb!  The staff were delightful and very attentive.  I loved every minute of it and ate my way through a large amount of food presented in such a way that we could try a little of many things!  It is a help yourself buffet.    ",5,September 2017,
Returning to Shangri-La,Michael Z,"After a cancelled travel in June I came back to Shangri-La Singapore. Due to a mistake during booking (wrong reservation dates), the check in was not as smooth as normally. I totally understand that. But the problem was solved very quickly by the staff. That is why I always come back to Shangri-La Singapore. They make it possible for the customer.  But after renovation, the Horizon Club rooms were reduced so you cannot get an early check in, which is for me bad, as I arrive always in the early morning after a long flight. Of course, you can have the room early, but you pay a 2nd night.For me this is a point that should be looked at from the management. ",4,September 2017,
One of the best,Chris C,"Sometimes its the places you know best that you forget to applaud. I have been a regular guest at this wonderful hotel over several years and coming to the end of a week long stay here. The majestic entry is eye catching, the pool area is magnificent, and the rooms are a cut above the rest. But it is the highly professional and friendly staff that really make this place - everyone from housekeeping, to the grounds staff and the reception areas make the effort. There are three wings to the hotel - the garden wing, the tower and the valley wing. If you ever get the opportunity to stay in the valley wing then you must do so - it is luxury defined. But the other parts of the hotel are excellent as well. My preference is the tower wing, in a Horizon Club room. These have all been…",5,September 2017,
Stay at Shangrila Hotel,Kit358,Nice environmentally friendly ambience coupled with caring staff made for a pleasant short staycation for my family.

Excellent hotel for business,imran_jaafar,"I had a 1 night stay at Shangri-La Singapore for a business meeting in Singapore. The hotel is located in a quieter area near central Singapore. My room was the ""Tower Wing King Deluxe"". Internet was provided free in the room and in the hotel area.

The breakfast selection was just average.",5,August 2017,
Lovely hotel in a lovely setting,Steve B,"This is a very nice hotel set within walking distance of the city centre and about 20 mins to the nearest underground station. (Orchard). Set back from the road, the spacious and grand entrance lobby is extremely welcoming, as notably are the reception staff. The room I was given was large with plenty of space to move around and to work if I wanted to.  Outside there is a resort style pool beside it there is one of the largest hotel gyms that I've been to. (Indoors) Dinner was of a buffet style, with a good selection of western and Asian food selection, seating was inside or out facing the pool. Other restaurants including Italian were available on an a la carte basis. Definitely be back to this hotel. Loved Singapore and loved the Shangri-La.",4,September 2017,
High end hotel with great service,Dan D,"This place is gorgeous! It's a high end hotel and reminds me of the Four Seasons. The service was very good and it's not overly expensive as far as high end hotels go. It's centrally located, easy to get to everything from the hotel, I walked to Orchard street. And mainly took Uber to the museums which was a very reasonable cost. Some minor issues with some of the servers wanting us to order right away but that just may be cultural. Our room was nicely appointed , the bed was a little firm for us but they added a pillow top and it was much softer. The breakfast buffet is amazing, I think they have every nation covered! We had dinner at each onsite restaurant, all were very good. Loved the pool and spa, can't wait to come back!",5,September 2017,
Decent location and good service,LaoK66,"The hotel is located at a quiet residential area off Orchard Road, one of the main shopping/dining areas in the city.

The hotel sits on a large real estate with beautiful gardens with nice landscaping and a large swimming pool.  We stayed at the Tower wing the most vintage building on the property but the rooms were recently upgraded.  Size of room is on the smaller side but still comfortable.

Best of the best,smilla n,"Everything at the Shangri-la is like fine silk. You may not initially appreciate the qualities that provide a depth of character, wonderful drape and impressive texture, but after some experience within this fabric, you begin to understand why the Shangri-la continues to be rated at the top of its class.   The surrounding buildings, rather than give the feeling that one is boxed in within the cosmopolitan city, give the illusion that one is nestled within the palm of the city state, and you can savour all of the near-equator botanicals that come with a deep tropical experience: a dedicated orchid ""pod,"" palms and plumerias abound.   No, I'm not being paid for this review, I'm just head-over-heels for the place. I can't wait to get back. ",5,August 2017,
Stunning in every way!,Rebecca M,"This is an absolutely stunning hotel. From the moment you are welcomed into the main foyer you realise that this place is special.

New look for an established hotel,CTC13,"The 46 year old Tower Wing has undergone a renovation, unveiling its new look in mid-2017. I stayed in its standard room (#1329) for two nights and enjoyed its clean, sleek and chic new look. However, its a huge change from its former look.   The lobby has gone from warm browns and opulent gold (with colorful flowers, ornate chandeliers and wall carvings, brown marble walls and flooring) to a cool white/black/green look. Its smart, trendy, chic with uber-cool flowers (green hydrangeas on moss balls, which are now a permanent fixture unlike its ever changing floral displays in the lobby of old). The lobby lounge has also become more trendy with Peranakan-style ceramics and books on shelves (like a trendy study), which is nice.

Fabulous hotel just minutes away from orchard road on foot - amazing staff,ejmna1,We traveled with our 6 year old to Singapore with the Shangri las being our first stop and it couldn't have been a better start for us.

The rooms we had was well proportioned with ample space for two grown ups and a roll out bed  with plenty of space left appreciate the room.  The pool and gardens are a great spot from which you would have no idea that you were in the middle of a city.

Shangri-La Singapore Horizon Club,bgraham3,"Normally I would review a hotel after my visit, however, this trip to Singapore has been exceptional.  As well as having a beautiful room and service, the staff and chefs in Horizon club pay fabulous attention to detail.  From signature dishes to individual attention, everything is planned to immense detail.  I must congratulate the Horizon club team and management for making this trip exceptional.   No guesses which hotel I will stay in for my future planned trips to Singapore   First class",5,August 2017,
Dinner,EaglevisionLowe,An established grand hotel in Singapore in an area of greenery. The gardens reflect the tropics with a collection of flowering orchids in the garden wing. It's many restaurants offer excellent food at higher end affordable prices . It's a great place to stay as well.,5,May 2017,
A great place to stay and dine,Rueschi,"After arriving at the hotel by car, the first impression is the overwhelming lobby with its gigantic pillars, the polished floor and the classic design.  Even though that our room was not ready for check-in, we got the offer to take a first breakfast at the buffet as well as shower and change in the gym. After this we roamed around Orchard Road for a hour and came back to get in our room.  The room was very clean and offered a pool view. All curtains were able to be controlled from the bed by remote. The King Size bed deserved its name and the bath room offered a comfortable size with a well dimensioned shower and enough storage room for two people.  The WiFi connection was high and for free. Remote connections and Skype calls were no problem.  I can highly recommend this hotel.",5,October 2016,
Disappointed with the Valley Wing,Glad Rags and Cabin Bags,"Valley Wing - usually love this hotel but this time very disappointed with a number of small issues that built up throughout the stay.  No orchids on arrival but not a problem, no ladies toiletries bag, minibar not restocked, continual poor service due to lack of staff afternoon and evening and breakfast was a joke, 5 incorrect orders and eggs sent back 3 times to be cooked properly before finally arriving without other ordered items.  Finally staff extremely rude over the ridiculous flip flop rule at breakfast but ok for hookers to be walking around the lobby and garden area night and day.  They were obviously high class ones!!  What a shame as this was the only place we would stay in Singapore!",3,August 2017,
Nice new rooms - busy breakfast,bang-boom,"Nice rooms with elegant decor. Staff, attentive, as always. Breakfast, standard - but not amazing. (Failed the obscure grapefruit juice test - they'd run-out by 10am). Hotel is close to Orchid Road - making it further from the airport, but closer to restaurants and night-life.",4,August 2017,
Beautiful hotel with amazing breakfast,robin b,We stayed 8 days. The staff are friendly and helpful.  Everything was air conditioned and cool. Rooms cleaned early so good if you are out early and want to come back early.   Plenty of complimentary water. They even come round in the evenings to see if you require more.   The breakfast was amazing. They cater for everyone with large selections to choose from.   The pool is nice and big so plenty of room and spacious around the pool.   Would definitely stay again,5,August 2017,
Great hotel,Bob B,"Unfortunately, as I was here on a business trip, I wasn't able to enjoy all the facilities that the hotel has to offer. But what I did experience was incredible service and high quality of accommodation and food. I stayed in the garden suite with a view of the garden and the room was spacious, functional and clean with a decent sized bathroom which contained a bath and a separate shower.  The breakfasts are amazing ... in terms of quality, quantity and variety. Catering for an international clientele, the buffet offers a considerable choice of foods; from pancakes and waffles to omelettes, sausages, bacon and baked beans to fruits, croissants and cereals to curries, noodles and rice. Upon returning late one evening, I ordered from the room service menu and was pleasantly…",5,August 2017,
In love with this hotel,Poupli,"I've stayed many times in this hotel in the garden wing (the main building still has old fashioned rooms) and I have to say that I like everything about it.  Warm welcoming from staff, the Shangri-la smell, the amazing pool and breakfast and spacious and luxurious rooms with the wooden floor.  If I was to return to Singapore, this would definitely be my landing point.",5,November 2016,
Worst stay!! Caution on Stay,noljassh,"We stayed for two days from August 23, 2017.  We were assigned rooms on the 6th floor, but renovations were underway on the 7th and 8th floors. The construction continued from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm Drilling noise and hammer sound continued.  For other luxury hotels, it is customary not to place a room in the immediate lower floors of the renovations.  I was really shocked when a luxury hotel like Shangri-la was doing this kind of room assignment.  It was a very stupid room allocation policy that blew everything from the kindness of the staff, to the skilled service, to the excellence of the facilities.  Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Hong Kong, etc. We were very satisfied with Shangri-La Hotel and our favorite hotel chain is Shangri-La.  But Shangri-la Singapore really gave me a…",1,August 2017,
Island Ballroom Banquet Events and 1 night stay,Nakhon_travels,"My value experience observation in Valley Wing, Island Ballroom at Shangri-la Singapore. Not so much about the hotel room, as many had already written their value feedback below, but more on the unpleasant dining experience over an invited event.   Back in my internship days with NUS as a Defence executive officer intern, I didn't realised that we've always taken manual labours like those banquet servers for granted. I've always been dining with my parents around the hotels since young and once, I had  also been to school functions which happened in the Island Ballroom as well with Shangri la. Im definitely not new to the environment. Though most, if not all that I observed working in the banquet line are uneducated, but some I met are really humble and respectful. I was telling…",1,August 2017,
Excellent hotel by all means !,Reem M,We stayed at the shangri-la with family and friends for 6 nights. We had very spacious connecting rooms at the garden wing with a pool view balcony. We were greeted with orchids upon arrival to the hotel by wonderful staff . The hotel has a beautiful luxurious lobby great for an afternoon tea or coffee time. The food and restaurants are amazing  especially chef  Marco's Italian restaurant. The main breakfast area is huge with a wide variety however I would say it needs updating since it has a cold feeling of 60s 70s  design that doesn't match the hotels overall look . We preferred to have our breakfast at the Italian restaurant.  I should also mention Johnny the very helpful and courteous concierge who granted us the best tables at different restaurants!
