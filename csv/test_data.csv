Good,7,"The staff were really friendly, room was super comfortable. Pretty affordable! Great for couples","The pool was really dirty, had lots of dirt at the bottom of the pool and it wasn't a comfortable experience. Also for breakfast the room tv says it's from 8am plus to 11am. But when I called in for breakfast at 1045 they said last order is 1030am but it wasn't stated in our menu that last order is 1030am. Hope that would be rectified. Thank you",Lavanya,Couple,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,1,"16, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]
