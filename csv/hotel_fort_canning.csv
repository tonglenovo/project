Good,7,"The staff were really friendly, room was super comfortable. Pretty affordable! Great for couples","The pool was really dirty, had lots of dirt at the bottom of the pool and it wasn't a comfortable experience. Also for breakfast the room tv says it's from 8am plus to 11am. But when I called in for breakfast at 1045 they said last order is 1030am but it wasn't stated in our menu that last order is 1030am. Hope that would be rectified.

Very Good,8,Wonderful location that allowed us to explore Fort Canning Park and easy access to Orchard Rd.

Very Good,8,"I like the location, that makes you feel a bit remote even if in the very center of the city. And the swimming pools are a dream!!!","Even if the room was nice and super clean, (junior suite), it was very humid. And the decoration is not as fancy as expected for a five star. the common parts of the building (hallways, restaurant) not renovated in a while maybe so it gives you the feeling you are in a Soviet Union hotel in the 80s kind of decoration. Fortunately all the staff is extremely nice and especially at the reception desk. Thanks Ivena :).",Beatrice,Solo traveler,Studio Suite,1,"7, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Comfortable rooms are all that is good about it.,7,"Rooms were fantastic and the complimentary upgrade sure made my day. One of the managers, Ruby, was exceptionally helpful and professional.","The restaurant was crap. the service and food were both below par for a 5-star hotel. The lobster mac and cheese had close to NO lobster, completely different from the picture on the menu. It had no seasoning either. I think it was cooked and then reheated. too much garlic as well.
One of the restaurant managers, a man, was making excuses when we asked him, ""Why did the starter come after the main course?"" He said, ""This is just the way we do things. We don't really look at which is the starter or the main. We just go down the list and send out food in that order."" No professionalism at all.
The waiters were walking zombies who also did not have any product knowledge when it came to food. They were not attentive. Only one waiter stood out to us as attentive and polite. He was an elderly gentleman who was not very tall. He carried himself as professionally as possible and always checked on our tables to see if we needed anything. He was more professional and polite than the male manager.
Breakfast was terrible as well. Food was trash. The nasi lemak was an insult to Singapore cuisine. The chef was obviously unpassionate about his job. He should find another job.",Dennis,Group,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,2,"19, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Pleasant stay,7,we loved the room and location.,"- The patio was too exposed
- Needs more ventilation in bathroom
- Aircon could use a higher capacity
- Place a signage to indicated exactly where to go to the pool and where to get the pool towels, took us quite awhile figuring it out, asked a staff where was the pool, she just pointed go to the back and there’s the pool, when infact you had to go thru another building, go up the elevator to get to the pool.
- minibar was empty, another hotel we went, same price but everything in minibar was free.
- Needs more lighting at the pool

The early evening drinks and appetizer was a wonderful way to relax and to meet other hotel guests.

"Disappointing stay, would not recommend",4,"It was well located within Fort Canning park so there was plenty of surrounding greenery, but yet it was very central and close to many eateries and restaurants.
The staff handling the booking and reservations online were very responsive and accommodating when we needed to shift the dates of our stay.","First off, we thought that the staff handling the check in process in the lobby behaved very unprofessionally. He referred to us as “boy” and “girl” - such as saying, “girl, sit here to wait”.
Second, we informed them when making the booking months in advance that we were staying there as a mini “honeymoon” as we had just gotten married that weekend before. We also requested a quiet room as we usually do. They informed us that they would “do something creative in the room” for us since we were on our honeymoon, and said that they would do their best to assign a quiet room on a higher floor for us. During check in, we again reiterated our request for a quiet room, but the lady handling our check in curtly replied that they had limited King rooms in the hotel. No apology, no explanation, did not seem to make any effort to allocate us a quiet room.
Not only did we not get a quiet room, we were in fact assigned an adjoining room next to a family, which was at the entrance of the corridor. The noises of housekeeping outside were audible, and we could even hear snippets of conversations and the alarm clock going off each morning from the family next door, through the adjoining door. One of the noisiest rooms we have ever stayed at. Despite saying that they would decorate the room, nothing was done during the two nights we stayed there.
Third, the hotel itself seemed far more tired and run down than when we had stayed there a few years ago. Many areas could be better kept and could use a fresh coat of paint.
Fourth, service was lacking in so many areas, from the people we interacted with during check in and those who were at the club reception for the gym and the pool. The hotel did not give any instructions for how to use the gym and pool. We had to find out on our own that you had to check in at the basement counter before using the pool and the gym, and that the pool could only be accessed from the third floor.",Joshua,Couple,Premium King Room,2,"10, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]
Average staycation,5,Location and ambience was good,"Booked this place for my daughters birthday but was a little disappointed
1) she didn’t get to use the pool. The excuse given was that it was booked out but when we had a peek there was hardly anyone swimming. The only slot they gave us was at 7am but I doubt any 8yo kid will be keen to swim at this hour unless they are training for a competition
2) most of the hotels would send a birthday cake - not this one.
3) one of our room was only available after 5pm. When we asked for a late checkout, this was denied. I felt that it would be a nice gesture to reciprocate the unavailability of the room. 
4) during check out, no one even asked how was our stay. As such, I thought I would share this review. Personally I still love the location of this boutique hotel but felt the service was a Little below par this round.",Jacob,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,1,"7, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Not worth the cost and does not live up to 5 star standards. Staycationers beware.,4,The room was generally quite nice and the bathroom in particular was beautiful. There was a nice bath tub which is good for a staycation. The pool was not too crowded. Location is inside Fort Canning which is nice.,"Overall I do not feel that the service standards met my expectations for a 5 star hotel. The check in staff were curt and unhelpful at check in. We secured a pool slot from 5:30 - 7 pm, and also asked if it was possible to stay at the pool past 7 pm. The staff said that it was not possible, but near the end of our 7 pm slot, the pool was totally empty. It would have cost them nothing to give us an additional slot, since it seemed that there was no one else booked in anyways.
At the pool, service was slow and there was no way to easily order food or drinks. The waiter seemed confused and had to go and retrieve the menu from a QR code inside the building, which took another 30 minutes. This could be easily remedied by having ready QR codes by the pool and coming up with some sort of pool side ordering experience.
We were also looking forward to breakfast at the hotel, but upon check in were told that the only available slot was at 7 am, which felt way too early. No apologies or attempts to help us come up with alternate solutions. We ended up checking out early to eat out at a nearby restaurant.
Given Covid and the havoc it has wreaked on the hospitality industry, I understand that many hotels are understaffed.

After which, she then told me need to sign indemnity form prior to using. Then finally when we are done with the gym usage (barely 30 mins, due to unpleasant experience) and i proceeded to return gym key access, lady then said no need to sign indemnity form which i dont understand why suddenly no need.

It was good and pleasant.,10,I liked the hotel's environment with all its greenary. The hotel and my room was very clean and loved the small balcony area with the doors and all. All the staff at the F&B outlets especially Jonathan and Vincent were very professional and helpful.,The staff who checked me in said he gave me the room with the best view. I was in 201 and the view was horrible. Later i found out he was not the check in staff but he is with the concierge who stepped in to support with my check in as it was lunch time.

I was very disappointed and had to leave the hotel earlier than expected.,2,Location.,"Very disappointed, I had to leave the hotel earlier than expected after 4 nights. I could not stay in there anymore. Several issues, which can be read in other reviews here. Any hotel should not deliver such a poor service to customers. 
Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews carefully prior to my booking. My mistake. Lesson learnt.
The hotel lobby, corridors and in general common areas are totally left without any cleaning in days. 
Food trails left outside the rooms without anyone picking them up for up to 24 hours. 
Room itself was poorly cleaned.  
Most of times reception was unattended. No pick uf of calls.
I understood the hotel was facing problems due to very limited staff available. Probably a pandemic effect. 
The hotel should be closed until able to deliver a reasonable service to clients.",Christian,Solo traveler,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,5,"3, 2022",Italy,it,[List]

Do ask them what restrictions they have upon arrival. The service desk did not update us upon checking in.",Jon,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,2,"15, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]
3-star hotel advertising as a 5-star,5,The location and setting of the hotel is beautiful. It poses lots of opportunity for an amazing hotel if more effort would go in.,"The hotel outside facilities looked dilapidated as if the hotel had not been used for years. The lobby was dirty, clearly it had not seen a proper cleaning for at least a week. The hallway to the lifts were similarly dirty. Not vacuumed recently.
The bar top in the main lobby was falling apart and some simple A4 paper stated ‘under maintenance’. 
We arrived early at the hotel after missing our flight and asked for an early check-in, but were rudely answered to wait to 3pm, the standard check in time. At 3pm the room was not ready and we were told to wait. Only after pressuring that we would leave if they did not uphold their part of the deal (providing a hotel room for that day) was a room made available.

Unpleasant experience,1,The room and breakfast is ok.,"We were there at 2plus with 2 toddlers hoping for an earlier check in. To the other extreme, we only managed to collect our keys 10 minutes  past 3pm which is later than the official checked in time and this is only after a few attempts checking with the staff. It was only the latest check with the manager that the room was ready and placed at the side of the reception staff as she was talking to new guests. Just wondering if we will continue to sit down there and wait unnecessarily if we don't check with them again. That sums up a bad start to the day. The situation was worse when I need to go around the whole hotel to just to search for swimming towels. It was shocking that the towels were placed no where near the pool. I walked back to the level two door that I came out from to search for towels after seeing no towels around the pool. I was told by a guest that the towel was taken from basement one. I walked down from level 2 after passing the stretch of hotel with dripping water one level down, out of the glass door near the reception and took that glass lift to basement one, past the b1 carpark before reaching the towel collection point. After taking the towel, I was told that the nearest lift up was not working. I walked past a Caucasian guest asking me where do I get the towel? Can you believe it? Everyone walking around the hotel looking for swimming pool towels that were 3 floors down. (It will be consider fortunate for guests who made their way from the lap pool side and more unfortunate for someone like me who went from the other side , walked one whole round before getting to the correct place. I have to climb 3 storeys up before reaching the lap pool and up the small stairs before eventually reaching the pool where my family was. My wife thought why I went away for so long while she struggled with 2 toddlers in the pool. It's really confusing where there well no bathroom towels nearer to the pool unlike any other hotels.",Soo,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room,1,"3, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]
Disappointing,3,The food was fair and the bed was really comfortable. The location is also excellent.,"The staff were almost non existant. I had food left outside my room for 24 hours which was pretty grim, and the general state of the hotel was quite unclean with lots of dust and with common areas looking like they hadn't been vaccummed in a fair amount of time.

It is under staffed with no one permanently on the bar which closely comparatively early. No towels are provided for the pool anymore (you have to walk to the next building, go 2-3 floors down to the outsources gym, however nobody tells you about this).
The minibar is empty.
Breakfast is no longer what it used to be with no visible staff behind the counter and options are very limited.
No umbrellas are available even though in a rainy season!
And finally we asked staff to book a taxi but we weren’t told it was cash only.

The bed was cosy and comfortable. The rooms were clean.","Check-in - 
A request for an early check in(since there is a senior citizen travelling) was met with a curt take a suite for an additional SGD 600, by a front office manager who was not even attending to our issue.
We were given some unwanted information, by the said person, about add on breakfast packages. The way it was put forward was belittling. As if we did not understand the significance of signing off on documents.
No one even bothered to show us to our rooms. We were shown the way to an elevator on request. We had to ask how to work around it, since there was a keycard entry. And exactly 5 minutes later the same gentleman walked another guest to a room right across ours. The only difference this time around, the guest was from a western country. 
It's sad that a property doesn't think a family that is travelling together should be given rooms that are close to each other.
Food - 
Of the 4 days we had breakfast, the spread was exactly the same for 3 days. At SGD 25++ one would expect a little more. The staff at the breakfast was cheerful and on point. 
Location -
Through the location is walkable to MTR's, there is a fair bit of waking up and down a small hillock.

Enjoyable 3 night stay in an intimate hotel.,8,"Good overall facilities in room, including kettle and tea making facilities, which is always a plus. There are two pools and it is not a large hotel so you don't feel anonymous. Didn't use the restaurant in the evening, but the breakfasts were good with plenty of choice.  Another plus is free drinks for guests between 6.00-7.00pm, which is a nice gesture.","Bathroom layout in our room was a bit quirky, being completely glassed at the back of the room, i.e. overlooking the outside so every time we used it we had to use the blinds, but at least they were electrically operated. The location is lovely and quiet, being situated in the park, but on the downside it is quite a trek to the nearest underground station, and its uphill on the way back, because the hotel is set at a relatively high level.

At breakfast we asked for a tissue to wrap up our 2 remaining muffins to avoid food wastage. Instead the waiter confiscated our muffins and brought them back to the kitchen without throwing them away.  We wonder whether the hotel would actually reuse these muffins for the next guests!
Also the facilities are gorgeous but need maintenance; towels at the pool were left there overnight and no one bothers to clean them.

I contacted the staff, to try at get the gate unlocked and make it easier for my wife to get to the pool. For some reason it couldn't be done, without any excuse for it !! Not really very helpful.

However, they have disabled every smart feature in the TV. You're only limited to a few tv channels that show old movies and shows. Seriously, who watches TV anymore! I had my own FireStick to connect to the TV. But they have also disabled any means of switching the input on the TV so you can't even switch to HDMI. The remotes are aftermarket remotes with only the necessary buttons. And they've disabled the physical buttons on the TV to go through menus. It's not like this was an oversight from their part. They're doing this intentionally! I absolutely hated the hours i spent late at night watching netflix on my phone when i had this large TV that i could be watching on.
