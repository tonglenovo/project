Good,7,,"Wenn man immer nur in die Orchard Road will dann ist die Lage gut das sind es nur ca. 200 m hin.
Für alle anderen Sehenswürdigkeiten und Aktivitäten liegt das Hotel wirklich am anderen Ende.
Was mich ein bisschen stört ist dass ich überhaupt keinen Service kostenlos gibt, sprich man muss wirklich alles extra bezahlen.
Das Frühstück geht in das Mittagessen ohne Pause über und dabei ist mir auch ein Missgeschick passiert und zwar habe ich mir ein Teller Nudeln geholt dabei hat die Kellnerin mich dann auch gefragt ob ich lunch gebucht habe und ich sagte nein.
Ich sage ich gehe ganz schnell hoch und kläre das ab dass es ein Missverständnis gab.
Der Rezeptionist sprach sehr gut Englisch und hat mich komischerweise trotzdem nicht verstanden und hat mich andauernd gefragt ob ich finde dass das Mittagessen zu teuer ist so sagte ich nein aber es wäre schön wenn Sie mir etwas entgegenkommen könnten da ich annahm es wäre nur Frühstück um habe aber aus Versehen einen Teller vom Mittagessen gegessen ohne Fleisch ohne irgendwas wirklich nur Nudeln.
Dann musste ich trotz allem madenlos 85 € bezahlen das war die teuerste asiabox sozusagen die ich in meinem Leben je hatte die bekomme ich in Berlin an jeder Ecke für 2,95 €
Das alleine war für mich ausschlaggebend sich so zu stur zu stellen dass ich da nie mehr einchecken würde.
Da ging es mir noch nicht mal um das Geld sondern hauptsächlich ums Prinzip weil gar kein Entgegenkommen da war.

Then I upgraded to the valley wing for what I was told would be an additional $300 Singapore dollars per night,or an additional $1200 Singapore dollars. On the first night,bathtub didn’t drain. The next morning, the room safe malfunctioned, so I couldn’t secure my passport. I asked for a different room and had to move all my personal possessions to the next room. What a hassle. Very annoying. I was told that I would get a 50% discount of the $300 Singapore dollars and was led to believe it would be for the 4 nights. At checkout, I was told it was 50% off for one night only. Then I find out it was $330 Singapore dollars per night, not $300. They also charged me for service charge of $30 Singapore dollars, on top of the $300 for he room charge, stating it’s a “service charge.” For what. I did not agree to that service charge. Booking dot com should review my bill and explain. It is a nice hotel but it has problems being straight up.",Anonymous,Solo traveler,,4,"2, 2019",United States of America,us,[List]
Poor,3.8,"1. the design of garden wing is really beautiful!
2. Room service was enjoyable.
3. Some of the young staff at the Italian restaurant and room service was professional and nice.","Totally disappointed!!!
It makes me not want choose Shangri-La anywhere ever again!
1. They downgraded our room without any apologies when we arrived at midnight.
2. They downgraded our room by charging us the exact same price of the original higher price room we have booked, which over charged 120 SGD. Instead they offered you breakfast that we didn’t need at all.
.
We booked pool view room which changed 320 per night, and the order was non refundable. They downgraded our room to city view which was 280 SDG per night. And they still charged us 320 per night without any explanation!
This is the first time I have ever experienced situations like this in 5 stars hotel or any hotels. Ridiculous..
.
3. Annoying fake smile and rude attitude towards elders. Especially during check in and check out. Their attitude and solution to this situation was really disappointed and not reasonable. Their fake smile and rude attitude towards elders really pissed you off!
.
4. After we insisted that their offer was not reasonable,they have taken almost an hour to a conclusion that they would offer a 50% off of the first night ,the 50% percent off was still 50% off 320 SDG. And the last 2 days in city view still charges us 320 per day! unbelievable!
We asked for city view price of the other 2 nights because we have not stayed in the pool view room. We spend 3 nights in the lower price city view room and we still have to pay the pool view price?
The funny thing was they said they could offer us a 40 SDG discount of the last 2 nights, which was actually how much the city view room was charged. Unbelievable!
They called this discount like they were doing a nice favor to us.
Too ridiculous to have any more word to say.
I had to ended the check out as soon as possible so I could head to our next hotel, Mandarin Oriental, which was spectacular. I wish I should have gone there at first place so I didn’t have to be this disappointed...

Großartiges Hotel für einen luxuriösen Familienurlaub in Singapur,10,"Zimmer:
Wir haben 10 Tage als Familie mit 1 Kind in einer ""Horizon Club Junior Suite"" im Tower Wing verbracht. Die Ausstattung war hervorragend (und exakt so wie auf der Website des Hotels gezeigt), die kleine Küche inkl. Kühlschrank, Kaffeemaschine etc. war ein schönes Extra (und täglich neu mit Wasserflaschen und Kaffeekapseln befüllt), die Ankleide hätte auch für 6 Personen gereicht. Die Beleuchtung im Zimmer ist durchdacht und vielfältig einstellbar, es war unglaublich ruhig, die Betten waren bequem, die vielen Sitzgelegenheiten im weitläufigen Zimmer machen auch einen ""Hoteltag"" zum Ausruhen zwischendurch angenehm. Wir haben nichts vermisst.
Hotel-Annehmlichkeiten:
Erstaunlich kinderfreundlich, ohne ein ""Familienhotel"" zu sein! Die Kinder-Wasserspielwelt ""Splash"" ist nicht riesig, hat aber für kleine und große Kinder was zu bieten und ist eine tolle Ergänzung zum Pool, wir waren fast jeden Tag da (in Corona-Zeiten kann man jeden Tag 1x 1h Slot dort buchen). Die Indoor-Spielwelt ""Buds"" ist ebenfalls liebevoll gestaltet, für größere Kids aber eher langweilig, und kostet pro Session einen kleinen Aufpreis. Das Kinder-Kochstudio, das es ebenfalls gibt, sah toll aus, haben wir aber nicht ausprobiert.
Für die Erwachsenen gab es dann die Horizon Lounge im 24. Stock, wo Kinder Mo-Fr erst ab 12 willkommen sind (Wochenends gibt es dort sogar extra Kinderbesteck, Bücher etc.) - das war für meine Frau und mich eine schöne Gelegenheit, in ruhigem Ambiente ein paar leckere Häppchen zu essen und einen leckeren Tropfen zu trinken.
Die Origin Bar macht herausragend gute Drinks, die auch nicht teurer sind als gute Drinks in der Stadt (20+ SGD).
Das Frühstück in ""The Line"" ist super vielfältig.
Lage: Das Hotel ist ein paar Fußminuten vom Ende der Orchard Road entfernt, dort gibt es auch direkt eine Bushaltestelle, von der aus man zügig weiter kommt (auch zur MRT). Für manche Ziele ist es wg.","Mir fällt nur eine Sache überhaupt ein: Salz- und Pfeffermühlen statt Papierpäckchen in ""The Line"" wären toll - evtl. ist das aber auch noch eine Corona-Maßnahme, ich habe nicht nachgefragt.
Auf der anderen Seite gibt es so viel 5*-Service ungefragt on top, wie zum Beispiel überraschend eine Geburtstagstorte für ein Geburtstagskind in der Familie aus der hauseigenen Konditorei, dass mir dieser Punkt am Ende wirklich schnuppe war :)",Florian,Family,Horizon Club Junior Suite King,9,"16, 2022",Germany,de,[List]

Our room got upgraded as well, that was a pleasant experience! Smooth checkin and check out, and good housekeeping.","The food quality can be much better, especially at the Line. The seafood platter was very salty and not fresh at all! Even other food items were mediocre and very salty - was expecting a much better quality of ingredients. 
The room service was much better, although I think it was served from the same kitchen.
The pool was very busy during our stay and we couldn’t get any space for the first two days - there was no reservation system like for half a day or something, so everyone gets a spot.",Aditi,Family,Garden Wing Deluxe Pool Twin,3,"15, 2021",Singapore,sg,[List]

Disappointing,4,Room view and in room breakfast selection.,"No valet parking unlike other hotels of the same status.   This meant we had to park ourselves, outside, and walk to the hotel lobby in the rain.
Waited 2hrs over the check-in time till the room was ready....and the consierge said he'd call me when the room was ready, however, after being sick of waiting I went back to the check-in desk only to find my room ready but he'd not bothered to call me.
When I booked the room I informed them that it was for our anniversary and I received feedback that they would arrange a special presentation.  Upon being told that my room was ready (2hrs late) I asked if they'd remembered my anniversary request....the check-in gentleman immediately checked his phone then ran off....after 5mins he returned to say it was all arranged......upon entering our room there had been no such arrangement and then we got a knock at the door upon which a housemaid brought a cake....meaning....they had done nothing and I had had to remind them.
Only after complaining about the 2hr delay did I get a 1hr late check out and $50 off any room service....this was not offered... I had to argue my disappointment.

the person who helped me to do the check in...i feel he is quite passive aggressive and sarcastic. just dont feel comfortable when he talked. 
the service at THE LINE restaurant is also dropped a lot. maybe after covid lack of manpower? all staff seems stress and never talk much. when you talk to them, they won't reply, no acknowledgement. they just do it quietly without talk. need to wait sometime before we are seated to eat our breakfast buffet. 
when i want to take complimentary parking coupon from the reception, i said sorry may i get the complimentary parking ticket? she no answer. she just take from drawer and pass to me. never say sure...have a nice day. or anything. so cold right? i expect more warmness from a 5 stars hotel.  oh yah . their room fridge is really not cold. i almost thought it was spoil.

In our room the wallpaper came off the wall, not acceptable at all for that price. Also the towels are old and some of them look like an old rag. The kids club is not for free and only an hour. In the splash Park you need to accompany your children until 12 years old which apologies I find insane. The breakfast is to crowed and stressful and the food has lots of variety but the taste is lala. outside the birds fly on your table which is very unhygienic. the staff at breakfast is very inattentive and couldn’t care less. there was only one nice waiter his name was Manoj.

check-in process was fast and made arrangements for us to check in earlier","1) Service before stay- kept sending me long automated messages requiring me to submit details before stay. only to realise I have to submit again at check in
2) Housekeeping- the housekeeping team did not replenish toiletries until we requested. when I asked for child amentities, I was told to pay $85 or use adult’s ones. 
when we requested for additional housekeeping service in the day, we were told that it’s chargeable. and the senior housekeeper started taking photos of the room wanting to report to their management. she even told us that the mess made by the kids would cost us additional charges, in a very stern and unfriendly tone. not something I would expect of a supposedly family friendly hotel
2) check out- we wanted to check the bill with the staff but was told to just drop the hotel cards and leave. subsequently, we received a charge of almost $200 without telling us what is the breakdown of charges or any invoice sent to my email.",Yiling,Family,Tower Wing Deluxe King Room,2,"22, 2022",Singapore,sg,[List]

It was our first-ever time staying at Shangri-la Singapore and not sure if we should ever return.,4,The kids-related facilities - Buds and Splash - were good. The staff there were very welcoming and accommodating to the kids' needs.,"The check-in process was bad. Supposed to have gotten a room at 3pm (check-in time) but only managed to get a room almost at 6pm in the end. The front desk staff - Amanda (intern, I believe) and Ashwinder - tried their best to assist but unfortunately, they couldn’t do much. They had to repeatedly go back to the duty manager - Andreas - to get updates on the room delay and what could be done to keep us comfortable while waiting (frankly, nothing much except a ""welcome drink"" at The Line). The duty manager didn't even have the courtesy to come out and speak to us to explain the situation despite us waiting for ~3hrs. To make things worse, when we eventually headed to the room (after 6pm), it was already time for the kids' dinner, and we had to do in-room dining service. The food delivered had missing items (e.g., chicken congee with no chicken in it, chicken biryani with missing papadams) and is a poor representation of Asian cuisine tastiness (obviously prepared with Westerners in mind). We had to follow up repeatedly for things. Breakfast at The Line was another ""surreal"" experience altogether. We had not even stepped into the restaurant yet (and we were standing with 2 kids) and the front desk staff was already telling us that we need to leave in an hour's time. Frankly, very disappointed with the whole experience esp. given the price we paid and service we got.

We booked the Garden wing but ended up downgraded to the Tower wing with complimentary to Buds.
We took the public transport. It is not advisable if you have toddlers. It's a long walk. Maybe the hotel should consider a shuttle bus to nearby shopping malls.
We didn't have any chance to taste food of Shangri-la as there's no halal kitchen and utensils.

I have stayed in Shangri-la in Sentosa a couple of time and their service is NOT comparable at all, they are miles away and honestly I don’t think this hotel will ever catch up the one in Sentosa.

If we wanted the room we had booked it would have been an additional 1.5 hours (of course upgrades are nice however we specifically had booked a certain room for a reason).

So is the changing room (health club). Have Sauna, steam bath and jacuzzi.  Nice well equiped dressing table. Large hotel grounds to stroll (by Singapore standards).","The requirement to do payment of the holding charge before I step foot in the hotel.   The hotel told me they did this because I made the booking through booking.com.  Otherwise, they will do the charge upon checkin.
The breakfast queue for the Line is very long. The hotel has an alternative breakfast at the waterfall but the breakfast is less than 50% of the variety of the Line.  Hotel can allow customers to sit at another location  (around the pool) and still come  to the Line to take the food. This is the only issue that pisses many guests who pay high Room rates to enjoy the hotel.
The free bus shuttle to the city.  Shangri La apts residents get first choice and priority to take the bus shuttle as the bus route starts there.

The choice was much bigger, but the quality was far inferior than the food at the lounge. I was a bit dissapointed by this, especially after having read good reviews about it. Also I felt a bit rushed at the checkout, as I was asking if it was possible to check out a tad later and they made quite a big deal about checking out at 12:30. Also we had a small incident with the food at the lounge; while everybody was apologizing a hundred times they could have handled the situation better; e.g. by sending a small card or gesture to the room.

Operations Manager Ms.Zubeda at The Line and her team were absolutely superb taking care of our various requests and remembering our choices, whether it was breakfast or the champagne brunch on Sunday. 
Jaya at the breakfast egg station will surely be missed, loved his sweet smile and funny jokes in the morning which was more refreshing than coffee. Thank you Jaya!! Your friend will look for you in her next visit definitely 😄
A special shout out of heartfelt thanks to the lady who made me a coffee at 3.30am on Friday 21st Feb. She took me from the lobby lounge to the Horizon Club lounge with a cheerful smile and with such good humour at those wee hours. This was exactly what i needed to cure my insomnia. 
Loved the personal touch in everything and all the staff were truly an example of service with a smile at Shangri La.
Thank you to the The Waterfall and the cheerful male service staff during our late dinner on Friday night. My youngest niece had her first pasta at The Waterfall!! 
Buds will be remembered by my older niece who is counting down the days for her next visit there.
Truly an amazing home away from home experience. Will miss you all at the Shangri la.

The bed was very comfortable, and we slept like babies :) the blackout curtains did a serious job of blocking any light. The coffee pods provided in the room were rich and aromatic. The bathtub was nice as well, as was the rain shower. The breakfast was alacarte, but sufficed the purpose. Things could get a little tricky for vegetarian guests, but we managed fine with the given options on offer. We strolled down to Orchard occasionally, and also walked around the property.

First day after arrival our luggage was not delivered into the room. About 4 pm when kids were sleeping there were 4 telephone calls (we did not answer the call cos kids were sleeping, but they just keep on calling which really disturbed my young toddler’s sleep.

We were brought directly to the reception area at the Valley Wing and were made comfortable and welcomed with our choice of drinks while waiting for our turn to be checked in. 
The staff at the counter was thorough in explaining all that is expected from our stay and even kindly got our afternoon tea delicacies delivered directly to our room since we arrived at that timing. 
The entire stay was such a delight. We did not need to order food as the array of food and well-spaced timing from breakfast to afternoon tea to canapes kept us filled. The room was such a joy to be in especially when they considered that we had children with us and had decorated the room with a teepee and children's activity bags. It was made even more special when I received a cake for my birthday even without being told. 
We also appreciate the staff who served us during afternoon tea and canapes who were very helpful in ensuring we were served food items which were halal. 
Not to mention, the kids enjoyed all the available activities at the hotel. We simply stayed put at the hotel and did not leave the entire 3 days 2 nights we were there because everything was available. What more, our Valley Wing room was so comfortable and kept neat and clean daily.
