Merely average accommodation in Singapore,Sameer R,"I stayed here for 4 nights while on business in Singapore.  As others have noted, the location in the Marina is quite good as its walkable to Marina Sands, and there are several adjoining shopping plazas.  This was the principal reason for selecting this property as we were hosting our annual meeting as well as attending conferences at Marina Bay Sands.    I used their airport transfer service as the attendant was waiting for me just outside of baggage claim and quickly whisked me to the hotel.  Check in was quite quick and efficient, and I was given a club room (3502).  The room itself is adequate and of average size.  The bed comfort was ok, and the bathroom was a little dated.  I did have a decent view, and the accompanying club lounge was also somewhat average.  It only opens at 1p, and I found the canapes to be not that great.  Similarly, the buffet breakfast selections were not that tasty as they recycled the same items daily.  The coffee was atrocious.  Fortunately, the fare at their signature Japanese restaurant is very good, and I would return.  Other Cons - Service was somewhat inconsistent.  While the check-in folks were great as was the hotel operator, the restaurant staff were slow and not as attentive. - Lacking attention to detail.  The elevator buttons, as an example, didn't always work, and I had to push them multiple times even after registering my key card.  Also, they didn't leave out any sanitizer to clean workout equipment.    Again, I think its an average hotel at best, and I would consider an alternative next time I'm in Singapore.‚Ä¶",3
Pan Pacific - wonderful,Michaela230000,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location, great food, wonderful facilities, brilliant staff. My second time. Outstanding pool, gym, food restaurants and buffet - wow. Lovely room. Could not have chosen better.",5
Celebration dinner,manidab2016,"We came over fora family birthday celebration.  We were seates at the teppanyaki table, and chef Tommy Yeo hosted us.  His cooking was amazing and he has a great sense of humour.  Our favorite dishes were the beef tenderloin and the garlic fried rice.  We had a great time and will def be back.",5
High tea,Ashrina Majitha,"Went with a friend (2 pax), and had the afternoon tea with Bacha coffee (chocolate hill and pistachio)  Loved the sweets! Savoury options were fusion with Asian cuisine. Great steady service, especially Alan! Great experience.",5
Pan Pacific Singapore too good,Vlado B,"As a 20+ year Grand Hyatt guest, I found myself looking for a new location due to the recent closure for renovation. Having to build a relationship with a new property takes time and can be so hit and miss.   I was recommended the Pan Pacific Singapore at Marina Square, so I thought I would give it a try.   Let me tell you the property is well maintained and the staff are delivering a very high standard. I was there for four days, and every interaction was a pleasure. My room was pristine, and the views were awesome.   I dined at the Edge for breakfast which was included, and the multiple buffets were so extensive I didn't know where to start.   The Atrium lounge in the lobby was huge and perfect for casual meetings as I was there on business.  I couldn‚Äôt recommend this location enough, Staff 10/10, room 10/10, restaurant selections 10/10. Location 10/10.‚Ä¶",5
A great stay at this iconic hotel.,Stuart S,"Check in was speedy and check out was flawless.

The room was clean and the service from Service One when I called every day addressed me by my name.",5
New menu is great but,Justin Loh,It‚Äôs value for money but pls consider the following  - more savoury and balance out the sweets  - more variety for sweets. Less chocolate types and more fruit type of cakes?   Overall it was a great experience and impeccable experience.,4
Great hotel in a super location,Phil C,Great hotel in a superb location - stayed in a club room so get access to the 34th floor and it is worth lying there extra.

Weekend dim sum brunch,Wayne Tan,Good food and the customer service is friendly and approachable towards customers eating here for the first time.

Excellent service by janice!,Tiffany,"Stayed at pan pacific for 4 days 3 nights. As our hotel room includes breakfast, janice remembers us despite seeing each other once. She obliged when we wanted to change seats and reminded us that our club room has perks of sitting near the view area.  When we went for breakfast the next day, she happily greeted us and gave us a more cozy space where it‚Äôs more private. We would like to compliment her excellent service and all other hotel crew who remembered us. We enjoyed our stay here and will be back again!",5
Most memorable stay in SG City Centre,eciralc,"Having stayed in so many hotels locally in Singapore and overseas, Pan Pac Singapore really stood out with excellent hospitality. The room, facilities, and building reflects the 5*. The panoramic room booked is clean, big, and modern. Bath salts are provided amongst other amenities.  Location is just a stone‚Äôs throw away to Millenia Walk, Suntec City and Marina Square. It‚Äôs impossible to run out of food options in the vicinity.  The service is amazing from check in, to breakfast, to checkout. Amanda checked me in and could even remember and addressed me at checkout. Takes a lot of dedication to remember guests she interacted with despite meeting so many on a daily basis. I‚Äôm deeply impressed by her level of service!

Fantastic experience at Hai Tien Lo,Shirley Eu,"Hai Tien Lo @ Pan Pacific Singapore did a fantastic  job with my son's engagement dinner.  Their hostess Genevieve  was most efficient in assisting all my enquiries through to ensuring all my requirements will be taken care of on the night.  Special thanks to the assigned service team for that evening - Kelly, Weijian & Huiqi who did a marvellous job in rendering their excellent service from start to finish on the night.  Everything went smoothly without a hitch.    All my guests enjoyed the scrumptuous dishes, a sincere compliment to the chef and crew.   I found out later that a guest couple had their engagement dinner at Hai Tien Lo a few years ago and they were very also impressed with the food and service then.

Worst staycation ever!,celesgoh,"This is the WORST staycation EVER!!! TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Visited precovid and they were decent so decided to book it for my girl's birthday celebration. Requested for a baby cot twice, upon booking & checked in at 2pm but at 8pm when we returned from dinner, the cot is not even in. I called and they said will expedite. 9pm, cot still not delivered and it was passed my kids bedtime. Called and chased and finally cot arrived at 9.30pm. Requested for 2 sets of kids amenities but only 1 set was delivered (2 kids) and their excuse is that their supplies are running low so they cannot give me 2 sets...

The perfect staycation,KingMing,"Celebrated my daughter‚Äôs birthday at the hotel, every aspect of the establishment met my expectation. Very good location, stone‚Äôs throw from Suntec and Marina Square.   Service: Excellent, staff were all well trained, warm and friendly. Lanky counter staff (Jonathan) was professional, genuine and thorough, proactively suggested kids activities and was friendly to my daughter.   Room: Jonathan apologised for the renovation noise we may experience, but we did not hear any drilling or knocking throughout the 3D2N. Soap smells very nice.   Edge: Food and service was nice, variety was good, porridge fantastic. Female China chef makes gorgeous and delicious omelette. One auntie staff kept removing my cutleries whenever I leave my seat for seconds, not great.   Pool: Nice and clean,‚Ä¶",5

"Professional staff, View of Marina Floating Platform, Breakfast could be better",maryyeo,"We had various unique questions and requests, and the reservations team was prompt and professional in handling them. Thankful that they arranged for us the two conjoint rooms with the best view of the National Day Parade happening on the Marina Floating Platform, and we could witness all the live action of the parade from the comfort of our room. Checking in and out took less than five minutes each, even though they only had two staff at the Front Desk at any one time. Front desk manager Alicia was quick to come out of her office to offer assistance whenever she noticed that guests were in the queue for a few minutes. Amazing proactiveness.  Location-wise, it is amazingly well connected to Marina Square, Suntec City and Millenia Walk as they are all less than 3 minutes' walk‚Ä¶",4
Would not correct error in reservation. Completely non-responsive,ronazevin,"I made an on-line reservation for this hotel and the dates came up wrong - wrong month, wrong year.  I immediately tried to contact them, but had to wait several hours as the office was not open.  After being cut off twice (I think the office is in China) I was told to write an e-mail.  Then I got a response that they would not correct the ""non-refundable"" reservation.  I'm extremely frustrated as I won't be in Singapore when the reservation is dated.  Its not a cheap hotel, so I won't pay $1500 for an error from their website.  BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU BOOK, OR BETTER STILL, PICK ANOTHER HOTEL.",1

Comfortable Hotel Option,Nick G,"3 night stay in a City Suite was a comfortable experience. Check in process was quick, staff friendly and room was available early for us to access.   Room itself was spacious, pretty well appointed with good electric block out blinds, big Samsung screens in both the bedroom and separate lounge, well appointed bathroom with good water pressure, and a second toilet near the entry door which was handy.   Fridge was on the small side whuch limits your own storage of cool drinks. Mini bar was  complementary and contained the basics, but was not restocked during our stay. Plenty of bottled water was available though and was restocked each day.  The room we had was weirdly not on the same lifts that service the Pacific Club lounge so for us was Level 11 down to Level 4, change lifts,‚Ä¶",5
Birthday Lunch at Keyaki,Mark Wong,"Went to Keyaki for tenpayaki lunch to celebrate with my sister. We were served by chef Tommy, he was very friendly, detail (advise on the sequence to start eating when the dish was served for best taste) and skilful in displaying his teriyaki frying skill. We were also surprised with complementary mini birthday cake and a birthday 'card' made from salt on plate. Highly recommended.",5
Great Location,samandgary3,"My wife and I stayed in a standard room for 5 nights in early January. The hotel is in an excellent location just a few minutes walk from the Bay and its attractions and it is also very close to the Singapore underground which is excellent.

Overpriced - lacked in customer service,Claire C,"We spent ten days at the Pan Pacific. Very central to everything but this hotel was overpriced with room service as well as drinks and sweets. It lacked customer service. We asked for directions to the Big Bus pickup area,  we walked for one and a half ours going around in circles .. eventually the bus stop was only a 15 min walk from our hotel. We showed up and it was closed on Wednesday's . The hotel reception had no idea it wasn‚Äôt operable on Wednesday's.  We asked to have drinks and dinner up at  the restaurant on top floor, reception told us we weren‚Äôt permitted to go up unless we were staying above 22nd floor. Very disappointing.  We were jibbed but the taxi drivers in Singapore as well. This was our second trip - would not go back again.",2
Consistent service standards from Kelly,Reddotz,"This is our second time at Hai Tian Lou and we were served by Kelly for the second time.

Best when you travel with kids,Tif_mack,"Spacious harbour suite with MBS view was very lovely. We enjoyed it very much. Hotel is just a step away from Marina Sq, Suntec City, Millenia Walk - so convenient for foods/supermarket/shops.

It is small, but very well decorated. Pools were great with bar next to it. Thank you for providing kid‚Äôs ammenities and the lovely treats surprise prior to arrival.

WAITER STEVEN,Rosalind Goh,"Steven is very kind and helpful. He provided us with excellent service. We have a very memorable experience at the restaurant because of Steven.  I will come back to Edge again because of his good  service.  Edge is very blessed to have a good employee like Steven.   In my opinion, the seafood buffet wasn‚Äôt really worth the price charged at $115 as the chilli crab meat were soft and not fresh. The crabs were small too. I was expect pure cheese lobsters and oysters as mentioned in the menu but it was not as appealing as it sounded.   The restaurant also demanded for advance deposit payment for late cancellation. I expected a seafood buffet from Edge to be of better quality than other restaurants. It was quite a disappointment despite its wide variety of dishes. Tea was also ‚Ä¶",5

Great Hotel let down by disappointing Club experience,Peter I,"We have been staying at the PanPacific for many years. It has always been our hotel of choice. We returned after the couple of years od covid lockdown expecting the hotel to be the same as the pre-covid days. We stayed for 13 nigts from 27 JUne 2022 to 10 July 2022.  The hotel itself is the same and the Club suites are just as they used to be. The staff at the Club lounge (eg Shine, Macluther are still there are doing a wonderful job as they always have. A lovely group of professional and attendtive staff - who have become friends over the years). We stayed for 2 weeks. Lovely suites.

Especially so this time as we waited for 4 years due to personal reasons & Covid.  Unfortunately our experience this time was terrible & we left very upset & honestly are thinking of not going back again, which is unheard of for us.  The stay didn't start well.... We arrived from the UK at 6 am which we have done many times before. The receptionist was unhelpful & basically gave us a ""don't give a toss"" attitude! We were told we couldn't check in for at least 8 HOURS!!! We asked if there was a room we could freshen up & change so we didn't have to sit in reception for this amount of time.

Staff who attended to us, a man & a lady (wearing a black suit)  didn‚Äôt met our expectations as the basic body language, the tone of voice as well as the communication, how they carry themselves is very unprofessional.

Great Views and Decent Food but lacks the extra to be a Flagship Hotel.,xinli29288,"The Pan-Pacific Singapore is one of the hotels I wanted to explore for a long time. I booked a Club Harbour Room for a National Day stay. It was expectedly busy due the public holiday and National Day celebrations.  There wasn't an rooms for upgrade as well due to the peak crowd and a late check-out was offered as per membership benefit entitlements. If you are holding a GHA Discovery status, the benefits and service ends there, this pales in comparison to IHG or Marriott Bonvoy. For a flagship Pan-Pacific property, I find this rather disappointing.  The room was generally good, measuring about 38 sqm.

Highly recommended‚Ä¶ check the review for details,Fatima A,"Overall the hotel was very good, location was prime, staff extremely helpful and friendly, rooms were comfortable‚Ä¶ If anything needs an update it would be the carpets in the room as carpets in general are not the most hygienic things in hotel rooms.. I also like the fact that the hotel showers had big bottles of shampoo, shower gel and conditioner installed, as this reduces the amount of plastic waste from the small disposable bottles.. this is the best thing for an environmentally conscious hotel.. The hotel buffet had a wide variety of different cuisines and the room service was good as well..

Will never return - very disappointed in Singapore,Bertrand T,"Property was decent, service and processes are horrible. Room itself was musty and old, but decently-maintained.   1. Pre-charged me 150% of the room fee on booking. When asked why, staff had no idea why and refunded me the extra 50%. While emailing reservations support, the staff tried to upsell me a package instead of trying to resolve my problems.   2. Did not give me the free carpark coupon which was my entitlement. The carpark fee would have been $50 otherwise. Had to queue all over again to get it (oh, and check in is very long!)   3.

So we wanted to go to this Urban Jungle Village place which was a kids playground and they had this socks policy which was fine. But we didn't have any and asked if we could purchase one but no they didn't have any for sale and just pointed us out without any form of solution.

"Nice hotel, good location‚Ä¶,.",Robert S,"Nice hotel in a good location with good food options and great gym and pool facilities.

Testimonial for Jeff,Qi,Dinner was good and service was excellent. We were serve by Jeff who was really attentive and service oriented.

Great work mr Jeff! We had a great time a keyaki and would definitely recommend my friends here.,5
What an unforgettable Lunch,mix1987,"Jeffery, the waiter who served us, really went above and beyond to ensure that all our needs were met. When he knew that one of the member in the family is celebrating her birthday, he arranged for a complementary birthday cake. What an enjoyable experience. On top of that the food was fantastic as well.",5
"Beautiful hitel, highly recommend.",Hester W,"Beautiful and centrally located hotel. We had a very comfortable room with balcony and magnificent views of both Marina Bay Sands and the merlion. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We were here on a 2 day layover and it was very nice to relax at the pool and recover from jetlag. Lots of sunbeds in the shadow, great views from the pool. Hotel is connected to a shopping mall and we walked to the Marina Bay area in 10 minutes ( partially via the the shopping mall in the airco).",5

Highly recommended.",5
Buffet lunch,Clarencec,Food is great! Love the duck and Buddha jump over the wall. Patrick was attentive to the needs of the kids and great with the service. Would highly recommend those who love dim sum for a weekend brunch. Left a very happy family :),5
"Large, great conference hotel",asiagirl511,"This hotel has a great set of facilities for big events. Gym, pool and ballrooms are very nice. Food is generally good.

Great Service at a reasonable price,Dae-Seong (ÎåÄÏÑ±),"Been 2 years since I last visited Singapore. Booked a business suite. Checked in was prompt and smooth.

Lovely Stay,Dr. Stephen-Claude Hyatt,"I had a really good stay at the hotel. Great location, well-trained staff (although they gave me a higher rate when I needed to extend my room for a few days, and with no breakfast included :-( ), and great room service.",5
Oh Dear..........................,Andy S,"We have very fond memories from our previous stays, but standards/service has slipped. As previously, we booked a Club Room - there is now no dedicated easy to use check in late in the evening as before, and the Club now closes at 22.00 rather than midnight..............so doubly disappointing when we arrived after 22.00.  Room service and housekeeping were also very patchy and our laundry disappeared for nearly 2 days. The Club also no longer serves breakfast and now only opens at 13.00. The one positive is the excellent breakfast buffet, which remains the best offering in any hotel I've ever stayed in.",3
Birthday celebration,Jojo,"Wan was very kind. He was very friendly and created a very comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere for me and my family while we were dinning throughout. He provided excellent, top notch service. Can't be more satisfied from the whole experience :) Thank you so much Wan for making it an enjoyable experience for me and my family! ^o^",5
"Top notch food , service and ambience",amostet,The food and service is spot on. I came with my elderly aunties and the chef cook it accordingly to what we request. Service and ambience is great too. Will recommend to my friends and my loved ones. You should try the Ee fu noodles and the clay pot fish.,5
Great service and hospitality,Dave Wong,We were surprised that Mr Patrick recognised us when we sat in at Hai Tien Lo for a quick bite.  You are always attentive towards your diners and definitely an asset to the company.  Have to mention the quality and taste of the food we ordered is delicious as expected. We will definitely be back soon!,5
Pleasantly contented,AtomAnt62,"Stayed 3 days & 2 nights‚Ä¶.just to chill & relax.  Hotel was conveniently located in the heart of Marina Square area, where shopping & dining is of no worries. All are in the walking vicinity.  And if you are looking to look for the attractions like The Singapore Flyer, Marina Bay Casino or Gardens by the Bay or Marina Bay Shoppes are also nearby. Walking will probably be 15~20 mins, depending on your pace.  Checking in the hotel was a breeze for me & my spouse, with the professional work dedication of front desk staff, Triciaüëç We checked in to our room at 3pm, on the dot.

Super late check in,Guardian A,"Another communication problem. Was informed to let them know when will I arrive. Arrived earlier but couldn't find GHA dedicated front desk. Went to the reception counter and was told that room will be ready by 3pm.   I took initiative to ask if I can go gym first, reception only told me they have booked it for me without passing any card access. Then I saw GHA front desk, approach them but somehow the front desk (Ayaka) look so blur that she has to asked Jayrick for assitance. Got the temporary access card to gym from him.   After a while, I waited until 3pm and ask again if my room is ready. The room was not ready yet. Waited until 4pm then finally room is ""ready"". Went inside room but it still wasn't ready yet.

"Doing what they do best, and more",Yeo S,"I would like to write in to compliment Pan Pacific team. My wife and I held our wedding during Feb 2022, which is still during the circuit breaker phase. At that time, the rules were constantly undergoing changes, so it made planning a little more complicated than usual. However, we are happy and most delighted that Vasant, our hotel coordinator, was super professional in handling this. He gave us insights on potential issues that we have successfully avoided, not only that, personally I was truly surprised that nothing went wrong at all during the wedding. To be honest, this truly exceeds our expectations as we thought definitely something will go wrong during the whole ceremony.  The stay with Pan Pancific was also an excellent one. We were almost constantly eating, from the‚Ä¶",5

"Great hotel and location, but some room for improvement.",Lovetiger,"Hotel is in a great location where you can walk to the train station, shopping malls and places of touristic interest. Unfortunately there was no information available in the room or at check-in on this though so we took trains everywhere without realising that we could easy walk over to Marina Bay Area.   We had fantastic views from our Balcony and the rooms were good. The room positives were the view, Balmain toiletries, complimentary water (although never left in the fridge).  Breakfast had an extremely good variety catering for everyone‚Äôs needs.  We arrived early and the hotel kindly gave us a hospitality room to shower up and get ready, this allowed us to make the best use of our time in Singapore instead of waiting until 3pm to check in.   Things for the hotel to consider‚Ä¶",4

Lovely little high tea,Carmen M,"Had a high tea at Atrium in the lobby of the Pan Pacific. Enjoyed my raspberry mocktail and the savouries. Enjoyed some of the sweets more than others, but overall the quality was good. I think they do the japanese influence well on their dishes. They also offer a pot of tea or coffee with a choice of mocktail or sparkling tea with the $62 package. Kishore, our attendant was attentive and helpful and was happy to take some pictures for us.",5

Nice customer service at Edge,Linlin,"We were having staycation at Pan Pacific and had add on for breakfast for kid. I was served by Janice upon reaching Edge. I told her about my situation as my boy is not feeling well, can we bring some bread and porridge up to the room for my boy as we had already paid for my boy's breakfast.  Janice is very helpful and helped us to seek approval from her manager to allow us to bring porridge to our room. They even offer to deliver the porridge for us since the porridge is a hot item. Before delivering, her manager decided to heat up the porridge for us as he himself is a parent and understand that having a hot porridge is comforting. We really appreciate the service and the extra miles they went for us.",5
Bad Family Staycation Experience,Karl T,"TLDR;  1) Have 2 rooms booked for a weekend staycation   2) Communicated early with hotel staff that I have 2 rooms for the entire family.   3) Check in timings for the 2 rooms different by 3.5 hours (1 at 2pm and another at 5:30pm) affecting the itinerary planned. (Bear in mind there are young kids as guests who cannot just go ahead and sleep late just because the hotel didn‚Äôt prioritise my room availability earlier at the standard time of 3pm)   4) Was rejected a late checkout request of 12:45pm for one of the rooms after screwing up my itinerary for the first day.   5) Mini bar was empty for the suite when I received my room.    6) Socks requirement at the jungle playground was not mentioned throughout the entire booking and check in process.

High tea on the 25th of June,Kevin,"Service was alright. Took a few moments to get the waitresses attention to order. There was a soiled serviette on the floor before we arrived. Was served a single portion of sauces desserts amongst 3 pax, ended up asking for more 3 times. Asked for complimentary parking after paying the bill, waitress informed us that complimentary parking is only offered to bills over $150+ not knowing that $50+ X  3 pax entitles us to that. Only realises her mistake after reminding her that there are 3 of us. Comes back with one ticket and when we ask for 2 tickets mentions 1 parking ticket for every every $150 spending and Walks away without a care in the world.   Would I eat there again as a paying customer? No Free? Maybe.   Oh yeah scones were seeverly dry in the middle.",2
"Spacious room, great for family stays",taraonhols,"Did a staycation with my family and loved the location - the connection to 3 malls and the scenic walk to esplanade.  Opted to upgrade to their Panoramic room which comes with floor to ceiling window with a view and bathtub which my 2yo loved.   Another feature my lil one loved was the Urban Jungle Village - the hotel‚Äôs kids playground. Unlike some hotels‚Äô playroom, this one is generous in size (more than the size of 2 hotel rooms) and looks out to the pool which lets in natural daylight. The mat at the end of the wooden slide does shift a fair bit though when the kids land - something the hotel needs to take note of.  ",5
Nice Father‚Äôs Day Dinner,CharleneKQ,"Large variety of food and friendly, attentive service by the staff and special thanks to Aidil who provided excellent service and attentiveness. Food was generally nice but some were too salty like the crab, duck and prawn noodle soup. Desserts were yummy!",5
Great stay for exploring Singapore,Georgeous097,Fantastic room with a skyline view and a balcony which made the stay really special.  They acknowledged my husband‚Äôs birthday with sweet treats and our anniversary with balloons so do make sure to tell them of any special occasions.  Location is great for exploring the city. We used the hop on tour bus which picks up from Suntec City.  On the first day our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned. Not a huge problem but you would expect it to be.  The Edge restaurant for breakfast was really good too.,4

Dinner and lunch in town ( pan pacific ),Charles_Phua,"Came to this restaurant on 2 separate occasions. Once during dinner and once (a day after) for lunch. Always have a great impression on the restaurant food, especially their dim sum. Food is as usual great as before (Pre Covid). The only problem is during the very initial stage when arrived at the restaurant front entrance, there is like no one there to welcome the guest (ie. show the guest to an available table). Same incident happened 2 days in a row. Waited almost 10 mins before we have to approach one of the staffs (waiter/waitress) that we can grab hold of. It looks like they are fully occupied but that shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse. There‚Äôs a front counter or reception, but there‚Äôs no one there all or most of the time.

Families with babies pls take note,Kit H,"We are a new family of 3 and was looking forward to our staycation. We chose Pan-Pacific because of its proximity to parenting shops at nearby malls as well as the presence of the urban jungle adventure, which for us meant that the hotel was familiar with child friendly practices.  Overall, we had a good time there but there are some points that could be improved.  One was the presence of a court. Upon booking, I had written in to request for the reservation of a court and was told that it would be dependent upon arrival at check-in. I then wrote in a day before check in to ensure that there was a court, if not I would have to make arrangements. A cot is essentially a bed, and there shouldn‚Äôt have to be such uncertainty as to whether there would be one or not. There either will‚Ä¶",4

it was meh for a high end hotel,Emir H,"I have ever paid for a much much cheaper room rates at other hotels in Singapore and was treated way better than here. By cheaper I can say 10% of what I paid Pan Pacific.    Most staff at Pan Pacific(except the concierge staff at the front door) has no urgency or initiative and seem to treat guests differently.  I am not one who expects royalty treatment, but I do come from a customer service oriented worklife and paying Pan Pacific that amount for the 3 days, I feel regret and disappointment.  We even gotten our room at 3:30pm when we checked in at 2:30pm.  Apparently the staff decided not to inform me that my room is ready and just made us wait until I went to a busy front counter.

However, on our first day when we checked in, there was a small blood stain on the pillow and we brought it to the attention of the Housekeeping Dept. They gave us a new pillow and a fruit platter as compensation. We like the big TV screen and the toilet seat is always warm which we love it! The big bath tube was welcoming too.

Good value hotel close by to tourist spots,Kelvin M,"Value for money hotel, the bars, restaurants and lobby looks modern, but rooms can do with a little refurbishment.

Wonderful Staycation,Kulaprimo,Had a wonderful stay at this lovely hotel. Booked 2 rooms for a staycation for 4days and 3nights here. Check-in at 3pm was fast and simple and room was ready upon arrival. Room condition was clean and the wonderful tub (bath salt included) was huge. Room was huge and quiet. Linked to Marina Square and Suntec City which solved our food issue. View in the Panaromic Room was superb. Special thanks to staff Mr Akbar who checked in on us and made sure that all our needs were attended to. Would definitely recommend this place to those who want convenience.,5

10 year anniversary,gryphonmonster,"I decided to spend our 10 year wedding anniversary at Pan Pacific. I booked a Harbour Studio Room as I needed space for my family. It came with a huge bath tub and sweeping views of the Marina Bay. The room came with a 2 seater sofa and a bar top. At night while my daughter is asleep, i‚Äôd sit on the bar sipping wine and enjoy the breathtaking skyline of Singapore. Same thing in the morning, we‚Äôd sit facing outward with coffee from the Nespresso machine. We were given a box of pastry as gift. Small thought but appreciated.   I felt that the rooms were modern and clean, no complains about that. My Discovery membership was recognised but they could not upgrade me higher since this room was the highest tier.

We also love the bathroom layout with a large walk in shower. There were some minor hiccups with housekeeping, such as some bathroom amenities not replenished, stains found on towels, water bottles not provided, and room not vacuumed during our stay. It seemed room cleaning was carried out as a rush job. We were wondering if Housekeeping was understaffed due to Covid. However, all issues raised with Housekeeping staff were attended to satisfactorily. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel. Pan Pacific is now our preferred hotel in Singapore.",4

Remarkable services and Excellent food,Leon Leong,"Had a wonderful dinner at The Edge. The food was good and fresh. My family was impressed by Jes (waitress) services. My youngest son was not feeling well prior to the buffet dinner so we requested for some warm water. Jes noticed that my youngest son wasn't looking too well and asked if we require any panadol to go along with the warm water. From that moment on, Jes constantly provide additional effort to ensure that we are enjoying the buffet dinner and checking if my youngest son require any special request. Jes is so caring and helpful. I am so impressed by Jes's services. I will definitely recommend The Edge to everyone who enjoys good food and excellent services.  Thanks you Jes üòä",5

Pleasant stay,Edna,"My family and I (3 people) stayed here for vacation. We got a packaged deal through Expedia. The hotel Is close to public transportation (MRT and bus). Very central in the Marina Bay area. The hotel was clean and appearance was beautiful. Our hotel room was pretty clean. We stayed in a deluxe room, with a balcony and view of the Marina Bay (MBS and the Flyer were in view). Which was great. The room and beds were also comfortable. The hotel is also steps away from Suntec and Marina Square mall. There is also a small grocery store in the Marina Sq. Mall if you need any snacks, drinks and/or essentials. Everything was comfortable, especially after a long day of sightseeing. Overall we had a pleasant stay. I would highly recommend this hotel.",4

Great location but that's about it.,Jeremiah C,"The location is great and so is the quality of hotel rooms. But the service could use some improvement and elevators are extremely slow (or inefficient). It once took me 5 minutes to get to the lobby (with waiting and frequent stops between the floors). I only timed it once but that's because after so many delayed elevator rides, I was frustrated and wanted to know how long it actually took. Also, it is very difficult to get a taxi and at times, doorman/concierge would ignore my request for help.",2
A disappointment in many aspects,Ego13sg,"Stayed here for a family vacation which turned out to be a disappointing choice. From the mediocre food/breakfast at Edge (3days in a row) to drilling noise going off in the middle of the day (no advance notice).  This is an establishment that has lots to offer in a prime location, cooperating w Kidztopia for a kids friendly amenities is commendable but the let down seem widespread from lack of staff at Edge to housekeeping standards.   It is obvious manpower /shortage is an issue in areas that needed attention. Charging extras for kids under 6 to the club lounge for tea ($25++) was abit interesting esp when a suite was booked.   Overall the experience was startling terrible and hope they will improve prior to tourism returning full steam to our sunny island if not the hotel‚Ä¶",1

William was patient and professional as he summarised the main points of the contract and shared the common blind spots that young couples omitted when planning for their solemnisation. He was prompt with his updates, understanding the anxiousness of young couples as we sought to plan a solemnisation while facing the ever-changing rules and regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is parking right below the hotel, which connects to Marina Square as well.   We stayed in the Pacific Club Room with 2 young kids, and we were really grateful that the hotel granted us 2 cots. We also had club access, which was great for the kids afternoon tea break from 3-5pm. There was also evening canapes with alcoholic beverages from 6-8pm, but this was not so applicable to us.

Disappointing experience,AChitnis,"Visited Pan Pacific after 3 years and came away pretty much disappointed. Right from the website which did not allow me to make a direct booking to staff who were cold at all times., it appears that the pandemic has  made the the property rusty in their approach. The iron in the room had chocolate on its plate and the tea / coffee had not been restocked. Inspite of the fact that the gym is supposed to be open for 24 hours, i found the same closed till 7am. Breakfast spread remains good and the bar on the ground floor is a good place to meet for a late evening meeting. Overall pretty much disappointing experience.",3

Weekend Staycation,DY9923,"The team at Pacific Club has been fabulous. Great attentiveness from Harris, Shine and Charles. Kudos to the rest of the staff on L38.

I do recall being accorded a room upgrade from a Club King to a Club Harbour King (not sure if its a double room upgrade). Checking in and out was a breeze.  The champagne breakfast was a very underwhelming. I was seated away from the Pacific Club Guests not knowing that there was a designated area for us.

Fortunately, some extra staff processed our check in at their discovery counters.  Then we partook of their executive lounge. The service here was excellent. I would like commend Shine for her attentiveness to our needs.   Part of our needs was the extra water. We asked for this from room service, and it took more than 4 hours for the extra bottled water to arrive.   The beds and room was clean and their pillow menu made our sleep super relaxing.

The staff told me that the facilities team will come to us shortly.  So, in the end, the extra bed reaches me an hour after the call!  I am not sure is it still my fault, what if I keep calling them to make it until frustrated. then I will not deserve to wait for the 2 hours.

Pan-Pacific - almost excellent,Chris_Munn,"Very good hotel and with a bit more effort would be excellent.  Kettle missing in room and the app chat request is a bit clunky making it a long-winded process to have missing kettle and request extra towels.  Staff weer friendly and competent.  Biggest complaint was the quality of the food/compared to the very high price and the ""process"" at breakfast.  Serving yourself buffets (especially for things that don't have to be cooked especially) are not likely to add to the COVID risk and the weird way in which the buffet is set up makes it much more likely that if a hotel guest had COVID, he/she, by walking all over the giant and complex breakfast room, would be more likely to spread it than having guest serve themselves at a more logically arranged buffet.",4
Long weekend at Pan Pacific,Christy G,"It was maddening at first, long queue at check in, long waiting time for room to be available, long queue at breakfast line and food running out.... but I must say, it is to be expected on long weekends, as much as we want to enjoy with our family, the team at Pan Pacific makes it more bearable.   What I see is the vision of Pan Pac team to provide the best for the guest within it's limited constrains. Room make up was expedite, line at breakfast queue was cleared as fast as they could. Frankly speaking, this is the first time I see 3 staff concurrently clearing the table and it was ready within a minute. Manager in suit was also down at ground zero helping to clear plates and clean up the mess that diners left behind. Some diners were really messy with all the crumbs left all‚Ä¶",5

Breakfast was also good at Edge and Ms Siti delivered extremely good service as well, table was also cleared very promptly.

Jayrick and Shine's attention to detail is remarkable. They have made our check-in process seamless and a pleasant one. Our experiences at Pan Pacific Club were memorable, the views are stunning both day and night, where Shine and her team ushered us into a private dining room for our ad-hoc virtual meeting with our offices. There are many hotels in Singapore, and there are only 5 hotels made it to our listings. Pan Pacific is among them. My GHA membership is valued and a pleasent experience.

You can request from Oneservice on the phone or they even hve options like if you want ice/toiletries etc. instead of ringing up the operator.

I have booked 17 room nights with Agoda in April 2022.  It was a delightful experience for my eyes when I arrived at the hotel and saw the atrium and the lobby.

Nothing special and No need to pay extra for view that is so far away!,Chiang Loon C,"Not up to expectations when you have to pay S$400++ upgraded to view the Singapore river. It would be better off paying for a better view at Ritz or Park Royal right opposite Pan Pacific.  Firstly, your sofa are so dated that is already ""'dented'' in. The comfort level is Zero. I believe this should not be a standard for a 5 star rated Hotel. If you do not wish to change the damaged sofa, please just removed it from the rooms. It only reflects badly on your hotel image. Furthermore, we have already stated that we will celebrating our Son's bday, we thought some sort of little surprise from at typical 5 star hotel. This is something you should learn from Park Royal, there little surprises prepared during our stay when we were celebrating for another occasion. It is bemusing that‚Ä¶",3

We have stayed here only 3 times over the past 30 years. Our go to hotel has always been the Fairmont Hotel but this time we chose 4 nights at Pan Pacific and 3 at Fairmont. What a mistake. Pan Pacific hands down for us. From check in to check out was with ease. Although we noticed a lot of new staff in training they were always well supervised with an experienced hand.

Very poor service.  Also, when I realised I forgot to bring my swim shorts, I called Service One for help. Response was basically ""too bad"" and ""go figure it out yourself"". Service quality needs improvement if Pan Pac really wants to up the game. Definitely not planning to return given this extremely poor service",1
It's an old hotel,R K,"I chose this hotel for its location around different malls. However, do remember that this is an old hotel and everything in it is very well used.

The pool's filtration system is questionable too - with many debris and a salty taste when you accidentally get some water in your mouth",2

Beautiful property,CanberraSteve38,"It was a pleasure to stay at the Pan Pacific Singapore. The interior of the hotel is dramatically beautiful, the atrium being 1980s architecture at its best. My room, 1917, with a balcony offering a grand view over Marina Bay, could not have been better. The furnishings, lighting, decoration -- all was spacious, totally up to date, and so comfortable. The huge bathroom certainly stood out from the crowd. Dinner and breakfast at the Edge Buffet were cheerful experiences -- it was especially good to see how popular the buffet was with local family diners. Why I do not rate the Pan Pacific was ""excellent"" was that the hotel was not fully prepared for overseas travellers observing the vaccinated traveller lane arrangements in force in March 2022. Arriving passengers needed to have a‚Ä¶",4
PAN PACIFIC SINGAPORE VERY ENJOYABLE.,RockyBubbles,"My wife and I stayed at the Pan Pacific Singapore for two nights recently, though the hotel is a little dated, it was very nice and the Club Room was very comfortable. We arrived early (1000am) and we‚Äôre happy to drop our luggage at reception and have a look around town. I received a phone call from the hotel about an hour after check in to let me know the room was ready. Our luggage was delivered to the room. The hotel staff we‚Äôre very helpful with any questions. Because of Covid, there are no buffet style meals at the Edge restaurant, per say, all dishes are served by the staff there is no self service. The Edge Buffet is a must, it is the biggest Buffet I have ever seen and the food is outstanding with a very big variety of choices from western style dishes to Asian. The Club‚Ä¶",5
Outstanding customer service,Angie,"Highly recommend this 5 star hotel for all travelers. Their staff are professionals & are very responsive to their guests' needs most specially the reception staff & concierge. Special mention to Bell Captain, Thiagu who went out his way to retrieve our Grab order that was delivered to the wrong hotel! Thank you also to Jimmy, Day manager(?) for facilitating assistance to the matter. We will have stayed here for 7 days by the time we check out and it was an excellent choice. This will be one of our ""go to"" hotel when we visit SG; except for this damn pandemic we are here usually for the CNY festivities. Would like to thank also the housekeeping staff for making sure of our comfort & providing for our needs. As we say in Las Vegas, ""winner!"" Pan Pacific Singapore",5

Check-in/out was fast and smooth. Abhi upgraded our room and got us an early check-in late check-out, he‚Äôs most attentive to details and made sure our room was ok. Peggy and Boon from the phone one-service team were helpful too!  The pool is one of the better ones with lounge beds. Club sandwich and cocktails were delicious!   It was delightful to spend time with my toddler in the Urban Jungle. The play area is clean, new and inviting. They have many areas to play in and are sanitised regularly.   We were most impressed, the best staycation we've had.",5
Fun for kids!,Ben & Joy,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pan Pacific Hotel during the March holidays. Not only did we dip ourselves at their huge pool, there were also pool side activities for us as a family to play too! Pan Pacific also has recently launched a Jungle themed indoor play area for the kids (pictures attached). The food at Edge was fantastic...my kids love the wide selection of yummy cuisine.

There were minor hiccups in the planning phase due to the change in the COVID-19 measures, but Vasant, our coordinator was ever patient and accommodating to our requests. We are very grateful for that.  Actual day things went very smoothly, and we were surprised as we were prepared for things to go wrong. Super thankful to the Pan Pac team on the ground for making it such a success. All our guests were very happy.  The stay in the bridal suite was pleasant. Room was spacious and clean.

Dated rooms and ok breakfast,ericfwp,"I recently had my stay at pan pacific Singapore 28march to 30march 2022, booked a Panoramic room. We always go around staycation to try out their rooms or breakfast.   The rooms we had is a dated. Few of the lights kept blinking, bath soap at the shower area not functioning. Location is great, but the breakfast we had is kinda disappointing. The selection is limited. There isn‚Äôt soup. The waffles is hard and dry. Pastries limited. I‚Äôve been to edge before so was kinda expecting something will wow us. But we just had lunch outside.   Maybe they just re-open at February the standard may takes some time. I would say is not really a memorable experience.",3

Service crew are okay...but i was very upset that i didnt get the pod seat for my friend's ROM celebration..... called in twice to check and they confirmed that I'll get the seat. The day before my booking, they called and reconfirm about the pod seat and booking. But when i was there, i was told by the staff, everyone requested a pod seat, i am not the only one.... i think that was very rude.

Great choice for family staycation,Life is Good,"This hotel is one of the few in downtown Singapore that I wanted to experience since I was a kid in the early 1990s. My family really enjoyed our staycation, hats off to your team. Pan Pacific stands out as family oriented destination with facilities such as urban jungle village, shallow pool and outdoor games. Comfortable walking distance to the malls and easy accessibility to the key attractions in the city. Areas for improvement: Cleanliness of the swimming pools, swimming floats for toddlers etc.",5

"Great Customer Service, nice hotel and good location.",ChanC05,"To start off, Mr. Abhi from front desk made our check in a breeze and enjoyable one. He was very friendly and even took note of the request stated and wished the guest a happy birthday. Little gestures like this made our day. Complimentary dessert was sent to our room as birthday gift, that was very thoughtful. Only thing that caught me aback as I used to have frequent staycation at Pan Pacific,  this room came with totally no coffee cups, complimentary teas or coffee. As we were also too tired to be bothered by it, and the great service from Abhi and TJ has kind of compensated this oversight. So we did not make any request for them to be sent to our room. Overall a very nice hotel, clean, spacious, conveniently located.",4

Overall Good Stayca but cleanliness can be improved,bluedottie,"Overall Good,  Balcony deluxe room is quiet as the main door is a few metres away from common corridor. However, the balcony is a disappointment, can't be enjoyed as the food smell is always there, perhaps due to 12th floor not high enough, or due to poor smell filtration of the restaurants at lower floors. Had I known, I would have considered a room with bath-tub and forego the balcony. certified SG Clean? I have my doubts as there were obvious food crumbs on the office chair upon check-in; also noticed a very long hair at the shower floor before I used it. Check-in and check-out were efficient, counter staff were nice. No cutlery in the room except spoon for making tea/coffee. Bed is firm and good but Pillows are too flat. TV channels have good reception",3
Great room-only experience!,Hburn10,"Check In ‚Äì The lobby was empty when I hopped over from Conrad at 1pm on a weekday and was immediately attended to.

Being on 22nd floor and above also means I got to take the exterior bubble lift which offers super nice ascending/descending views of the neighborhood.   The space was quite enough even for 2pax, with a corridor leading into the main space containing the big and very firm king bed with double bedside tables equipped with charging points and lighting controls. Laid out‚Ä¶",4
Enjoyable Staycation,Fion L,"Room was clean and comfortable.  Few comments - Refreshment that should be preloaded in the fridge was not done so until requested.  Screen in the bathroom was not working upon check in, wasted like 30 mins for technician to rectified.  Went to the club lounge with my child.  Confectionary were served by default, have overlooked that there was a kids menu.  If was asked of this option, the lounge experience would be more enjoyable for my child. Order from room service (kids meal) took quite a while to arrive.  Other than the above, housekeeping service was prompt, this is excellent service.  Overstay stay experience was good and look forward to our next stay.",4
Nice Business Trip,IOM,"Nice Hotel with wonderful views (Singapore skyline and Suntec expo) and Internal Deco. Loved the shower experience despite not having a Tub in the room, as there were 3 shower methods, Rain, shower head and an angled one for sitting (I love this).  Loved the connectivity in the room for HDMI, USB, eternet and wifi. Unfortunately the pillows were not that comfortable (perhaps not to my preference). I wish there were more Halal options for breakfast but I enjoyed the pastries, salmon etc.",5
Inhumane treatment,Fed,"After arriving at Pan Pacific on the 20th with three other colleagues, I tested positive for Covid on the 21st. Pan Pacific not only failed to inform their staff, resulting in mixed situations with people visiting my room and delivering food products not according to health regulations but in the 5 days I have been in isolation I have not been catered to with water and the basic necessities incl. water, toilet paper, etc.  It was only when I complained to Johnathan on the 24th that I received some items. Atrocious and inhumane treatment. The hotel also never bothered to check in to see how I was coping with Covi. I will be contacting the Singapore authorities, my consulate, as well as the Singapore Ministry of Health to express my mistreatment during this trying period.",1
Weekend break,JellyB,"Had a weekend break. I like the location as it has easy access to the malls. Location is close to Esplanade, MBS, National Museum, Arab Quarter. Lovely for morning or evening walks.   It was fun being a local tourist. Walking through the malls to cool down, we walked comfortably to Peninsular Plaza for Burmese food and also Golden Mile Complex for authentic Thai food at Nana‚Äôs.   Morning strolls took us along Esplanade, Collyer Quay, Lau Pa Sat to end at Ya Kun China st for breakfast.  Another morning we made our way to Purvis Street to another famous traditional breakfast scene, YY kafeidian. The kaya buns are so fluffy.

A reputable hotel and friendly staffs,Vincent8190,"Stay: 21/Mar to 24/Mar (3 nights)  Pan Pacific Singapore, a very reputable hotel. Excellent location and room is big. However it does look abit old interior but overall is very clean! All of the staffs I meant are very friendly. Breakfast is international buffet.   Personally, I do not like the toilet basin as it make washing alittle difficult.   Lastly, I would like to give my direct thanks to a waitress named ZEHUA working part time at The Edge restaurant.

Basically they treated me as though I was a criminal/leper/pariah or worse.   They showed zero concern and offered no support despite the fact that it was highly likely that I contracted COVID while staying at their hotel.   Not once was I contacted to find out if I was OK or if I needed anything.

"Overall pleasant stay, although let down but breakfast experience",Wilson S,"The Champagne breakfast at Edge was a big letdown though. Although the restaurant reserved a corner for Club guests, breakfast service at Edge was pretty generic and inconsistent, unlike the personalized service you get in the Lounge. The spread for breakfast was pretty limited and quality of food was very average, definitely not what I would expect for a Champagne breakfast, which I expect to be more lavish and decadent. Simply serving a glass of Champagne with breakfast doesn‚Äôt qualify it as a Champagne breakfast in my opinion. On my second day, the staff who brought us to our table was not properly briefed, and we ended up being seated away from the designated Club guest area, where service was quite spotty and inconsistent.

Edge buffet :),katyh,This review is for the buffet restaurant located at level 3 of pan pacific Hotel Singapore. Firstly. It was difficult to make a reservation. But. I was surprised I got a call back and mu reservation had moved up from initially the waiting list. It was nice to know that it was followed up. Great job on that.   When we arrived. It was really crowded. Long queues while entering but was very efficient in getting in. Service was very warm and friendly from everyone.   Some food stations were swarmed. Especially the seafood. We spent time queuing for quite long but I think it was evident that that particular buffet station was overwhelmed. So was the salad cheeses station. However it was still and enjoyable time.

Impeccable Service ,Casmine,"Stayed with Pan Pacific as part of their A Taste of Japan staycation package, and we felt extremely well taken care of from check in to check out. Mr Abhi at reception provided wonderful service, upgrading our room, arranging for late check out etc. Right off the bat our staycation started on a joyful note :)   The room itself showed its age (carpets coming off the room edges etc), but we could also tell that it was cleaned up nicely. It was still very comfortable. The Japanese amenity gift was such a sweet touch.   The only part that wasn‚Äôt as lovely was the pool- it was quite small and overcrowded despite the reservation system. There was barely a clear spot to get in.

Nice buffet dinner at Edge restaurant,Char A,Went for the buffet dinner at the Edge restaurant. The range of food is quite extensive. The highlights are the sashimi and seafood like oysters and lobsters. Good and attentive service by Sonia and the restaurant manager (Raj). Will consider coming back again.,5
Amazing Club Lounge View,mic_leow,"We booked the city suite which is under the great fun-mily escape package for family with young kids.    It comes with an adorable bedding which is simply just a colourful kids design quilt placed on the sofa and to be converted into a bed. A teepee ( kids play tent ) and a portable kids luggage that was being placed right beside the tent.  It will be an added bonus if some kids amenities can be placed inside the luggage instead of just being an empty one. The kids were looking forward to some elements of surprise when they were opening up the luggage but found nothing inside..   Suite was spacious and came with two bathrooms which was great. However, room felt dated and old with the furnishings and dust can be seen at the coffee machine and wardrobe areas.  Thankfully, the TVs‚Ä¶",4
Excellent stay. I'LL BE BACK,andychua73,This is my second time coming back. My son loved it. The environment and surrounding. Food is nice and become a Discovery member to enjoy up to 25 percent discount on F&B. I ate there practically throughout my stay. I will definitely come back again.,5
Service feedback,Jon,"Service was good. Our server Sonia was very prompt with her clearing of plates. Am glad that she was the server for my dinner.  Food overall was very delicious, there was a great variety of food to choose from.",5
"Great service, great food! :) worth the money",Li Yan,"Enjoyed our time here. Was serve by Sonia and her service was great checking in from time to time, ensuring our meal was good. Food was great! Minus the fish and beef but everything else was prompt, especially for oysters",5
Family dinner,Ivan,"Food variety is good and nice, but certain counter need to queue very long. Sonia, a very fast, humble and responsive lady, hope to be served by her again when our next visit. Think some counters are short handed.",4
The Edge restaurant,Lily,"We had dinner buffet at the Edge and were served warmly by Sonia. She was attentive and quick to service for our table. It was a wonderful dinner with the family. However, there's a rather limited selection of food available here as compared to other international buffets. 5 for service, 3 for buffet selection. Chefs were kind to my children requesting for different kinds of food.",5
"Great room, location, service",koh,"Everything was wonderful but could I make two suggestions: in-room refreshments could be improved with a Nespresso machine. Many other 5-star hotels at similar price points have that in their rooms, it would be a nice addition.   Secondly, guests are required to book facilities such as the pool and gym however there does not appear to be a limit to the number people allowed at the pool since it was so crowded there was literally no space to swim. I think either the booking system could be scrapped or there should be a limit to the number of guests in the pool.",5
Charissa,Charissa,We had lunch in the edge and Sonia the server was incredibly professional and polite. She introduced herself and gave us such warm friendly service.   The food unfortunately was only ok and not up to hype. I guess the durian pudding was the only hit cos it disappeared very fast.,4
Nothing to be wowed about,Philip T,"Check-in Process on 12 Mar (Poor) Arrived at PP at about 12.20 pm. Saw that there was no q and approached one of the counters which was manned by a Ms Clarissa. To my disappointment, she didn't bother to acknowledge my presence at all and seemed to be bothered by serving one of her colleagues instead. Her colleague is not in uniform and he had some kind of staff pass in his hand. I suppose she was attending to him but the least she could do was to let me know. Her colleague who was standing beside her (can't remember her name but it starts with a 'D') also failed to acknowledge me. At no point in time did she apologise or at least acknowledge me though I think I made my presence felt and I was kept waiting and waiting for close to about 20 minutes. My wife then discovered there‚Ä¶",2
Terrible Experience,Jason D,"Terrible experience, when I first checked in they did not tell me I needed to pay a deposit and then at the restaurant they claimed I could not put charges on the room and then they charged my credit card without my approval. They stored my credit cards details which is against the law and visa policy. I will never come back to your hotel again.",1
First time staying with Pan Pacific,Ervi Margaretta,"Definitely not 5 stars hotel standard. Shower head was leaking, make up room service feels subpar - had to call twice. Toiletries not fully replenished, used glasses are left untouched & not cleaned.   Could have had a better experience than that.",2
Short staycation,Kevin Y,"The stay and breakfast were good. Expect queue for some of the breakfast counters. Check in and out was a breeze but do note that the entrances connecting to Marina are closed after 1030pm. Pool is a little smaller than usual 5 stars but it is not a major game changer. Staff are polite but didn't experience exceptional services that I have experienced in another 6 star hotel. Overall, for the price factor, the hotel is excellent.",4
"Good solid hotel, repeat guest",Yanxylovestotravel,"4.5 stars. It's what you expect. Efficiently run, large hotel, reasonable price, great location. No big surprises, you're in and out. Friendly staff for the most part, I'm impressed they can run it so well with such a big room count.  All my request were quickly taken care of. Impressive. Excellent location.

A wonderful staycation for a family of four,Mrs Ang,"After a hellish staycation at another 5 star hotel in Singapore, our staycation in Pan Pacific renewed my confidence in the service standards of hotel in Singapore.   Starting with the check-in process, everything was well-managed by the service team of the hotel. The staff so attentive that I hardly have to wait to receive service at the lobby. Moreover, the person serving me was actually working at the check out counter but did not hesitate to come over to assist me in my check in. She also did it so seamlessly that I had to applaud the versatility of the staffs in this hotel. Followed that, we managed to enter our room much earlier then expected.

Nice and comfortable stay,Shive81,"Came for a staycation with family. Very pleased with the hotel‚Äôs cleanliness and comfortable beddings. Check in with Mr Abhi is a breeze and he provided lots of helpful information and also got us a room with a nice view!   The indoor playground, Urban Village Jungle, is newly opened and it‚Äôs bright, clean and nice. We went there twice and also swam in their pool twice. Their pool is a lot of fun, they had a big ducky and donut float and it certainly brought lots of cheer for the kids!   The water pressure in the room is great and the toiletries provided are adequate and their Balmain bath amenities smells very good.   The only downside of the hotel is that they have very limited tv channels so not much tv entertainment at night time.  Overall it is a comfortable and good stay‚Ä¶",5

Edge Saturday brunch ,Anne Hannah,It was a Saturday buffet brunch and it was full. I brought my elderly mom to edge for lunch and didn't pre request for a table nearer the buffet due to her not being able to walk so well. The restaurant was full. Every table was taken. However Crystal took the extra effort to find me the best available table and took care of us. The food and service were great. However being a semi self help buffet there were long queues at the buffet lines as there seemed to be limited ppl behind the kitchen stations. But everyone did such a great job and still served with joy. Will be back. A must try. ,5

Rooms with Gorgeous Views,Timothi Ellim,"Thank you Ahbi for making this a great experience! Pan Pacific is an amazing hotel with lovely rooms, and their customer service makes it an even more excellent stay. Truly an awesome experience knowing the hotel cares about your experience every step of the way!    Context: We had initially booked the Panoramic room, which afforded a full length glass view of the Katong River area. However upon entering, I noticed the blinds were of the top to bottom nature and had a bit of a sag in the middle. Ordinarily this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue, however I have to admit my expectations for a panoramic room was to have a full length view (due to the promotional materials available online). Due to the sag in the blinds, my view was obstructed at my height of 1.78m. As such I didn‚Äôt have a‚Ä¶",5

Personalised and Attentive Service,Dave Wong,We were delighted to be sitter at an area served by Mr Patrick at Hai Tien Lo in Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore today.  Once again we were served by him since our last visit in 2019 before the pandemic.  You could feel that he serves with his heart and made us feel very welcome to have a meal here.  His attentiveness and warm service is beyond our expectations.  During these few years it is tough to be in the F&B and service industry and Mr Patrick deserves a word of encouragement for his commitments.  Thank you once again.  Regards Dave Wong  (Ig @checkushere),5
Hai Tien Lo,J.W.A,"Hai Tien Lo is a must visit Cantonese restaurant when you are at Pan Pacific.   Advance reservation stretching a few months shows how well loved Hai Tien Lo.

Seafood were fresh and we had an enjoyable time.  Our favourite is the durian Pengat which is the star of the day. Recommended to come again.,5
"Great service, but outdated rooms",Izwan,"After multiple visits to the Pan Pacific Singapore, I was horrified at how dilapidated the older pre-renovated rooms on the lower floors are. The design of the Balcony Deluxe Rooms were very much still stuck in the 1990s, with an irritating buzzing sound coming from the console behind the bed and exposed wires everywhere.  The part that immediately threw me off were the dirt, dust and even a dead spider in the lights of the bed's headboard console. Thankfully, the front desk was able to accommodate an upgrade‚Äìat a cost, to the Harbour Studio, and were helpful in finding another suitable option despite the busy Saturday check-ins. Though I have to say that this took a few attempts as they were insistent on getting a technician to fix the said issues.  Concierge were approachable‚Ä¶",2

Edge is a must visit!,dani,The buffet experience in edge is wonderful. The food selection is varied and there was just too much to eat. Guests are able to walk around to take their food with chefs assisting behind the screens. The safety measures put in place allows us to enjoy a buffet-like experience seamlessly. My toddler wanted to sit at the sofas near the seafood counter. I could tell that no one was sitting there and probably was a closed area. Crystal graciously led my kid to the sofa and let her choose where she wanted to sit. She even personally took care of our table. It was really a very happy time as a family. It's been great and team was really attentive and amazing. Looking forward to more visits soon! ,5

Wedding at Keyaki,Wanting,We had our wedding at the Garden Pavilion at Keyaki and it was really just the perfect casual and cosy wedding that we wanted.

Worst stay ever,Nur Rafhanah K,"Checked in at 3+ pm, it was smooth and fast, went out for shopping and dinner, came back to the room around 7pm, wanted to have a shower and bath because omicron is on the rise and I don‚Äôt think its hygienic to not shower. Only then to realise toilet was dirty, shower had hair scrunchie from previous guests.   Went to tub to clean before i fill it with water, to find dead skin and hair on tub, despite that i was ok to clean with hot water but drain was clogged. Was very accommodating and requested to change room so tht i could have my shower. 2 hours of wait and i still did not get a room change until i had to call and chase for a new room. After 2.5 hours room was changed, funny thing was room was only 4 doors down ours. Customer service gave the reason tht housekeeping needed‚Ä¶",1
Not yet fully recovered from Covid closures,Jeff K,"As a former professional hotel critic, I've stayed at hundreds of hotels for work reasons ‚Äì including the Pan Pacific, which I first visited (for purposes of reviewing it) nearly 20 years ago. I gave it five stars at the time, and cited it as one of the better bargains in town, as a five-star property at a fraction of the price of more famous places such as the Raffles & Fullerton Bay. I've also stayed there a couple of times while in Singapore for non-work reasons, or at least non-travel-work ones. I was continuously impressed with it in every way.  Which is why it pains me to give it three stars this time around. I'm guessing the property has been closed for most of the pandemic, but at this juncture it's lost a step or two ‚Äì which is all the more jarring given how many‚Ä¶",3
Amazing staff!!!,Juls,"Great experience, we enjoyed the hotel, room, facilities and most of all the personnel, absolutely amazing. Abhi, at check in was incredible. I‚Äôve made a big mistake, did a reservation for one night and went to the hotel to check in the day after! Abhi remained calmed, explained to me what happened, searched in the system to see if he could help, got me and my family the same room we reserved for the previous day, same rate, same benefits‚Ä¶ he saved our lives. Incredibly professional and friendly. He did our check out too, we thanked him again. Also, Siti in the club pacific and Edge restaurante at breakfast treated our kids and remembered that I didn‚Äôt take diary, asked if the latte I was ordering was with soy milk like day before‚Ä¶ these people make a huge difference, I‚Äôd return‚Ä¶",5
Outstanding Service by Mr Vasant and Team,muphium,"We held my wedding banquet at Pan Pacific Singapore and Mr Vasant was the key person who made our wedding absolutely memorable. He coordinated well with the rest of his team and made sure that all our needs were well taken care of, right from the event planning all the way even after our banquet was over.  We were offered two nights' stay at the ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay instead of Pan Pacific Singapore because Pan Pacific Singapore was designated as a SHN hotel. However, we were so impressed with Pan Pacific's hospitality that we paid to stay in their bridal suite a month later to reminisce our wedding.",5

"Worst Hotel Experience in Singapore- As a Singaporean,  it is shameful and disappointing",Alvin T,"My experience at Pan Pacific during my SHN  was the worst and most shameful from a 5 star hotel. I felt embarrassed as a Singaporean as I know there are there foreigners in the hotel who are having the experiencing. The food provided was simply not acceptable. By the time the meals were delivered to my room,   the food were cold or at room temperature. The quality of the food was disappointing and not tasteful. I ordered Grab food and the delivery of the food to my room was slow. I had to call the service line several times to make sure my food was delivered. Check in was slow and not efficient. There was no assistance.",1
Lovely takeaway standards from Pan Pacific dining.,TravelnLive89,"With the heightened alert phase still ongoing, any plans we have of dining at Pan Pacific's Hai Tien Lo or enjoying high tea at the Atrium is out of the question. Thankfully, they've made their dining offerings available online. And that's what we took advantage of over the last weekend and got it all delivered right up to our doorstep.   We had a little bit of everything. Some seasonal rice dumplings from Hai Tien Lo, some cold cuts from Marketplace and some sweet cakes from the Atrium's Bakery.   Everything arrived on time and more importantly, packed with care. Odd thing was when we asked for chilli sauce for our cantonese rice dumplings, they threw in packets of Heinz chilli sauce!?! We had a good laugh and overlooked the faux pas. Imagine squeezing Heinz on those elegant‚Ä¶",4

A Love Since Childhood,JonasCN,"Pan Pacific at Raffles Boulevard hopes a special place in my heart. I have visited the hotel at least once during my childhood, my teenage years, and when I started working. Whether it was celebrating birthday of relatives, to a meal before celebrating at the Singapore River during Chinese New Year, to meals with friends after work, it has been a prominent landmark during my childhood. I was very excited with first staycation in Pan Pacific during the Covid Period.   I love my stay and this is why:  1. The view in my room was awesome. I requested for a high floor and I was pleasantly surprised was granted at the 19th floor. Having a balcony is a bonus because I can view the Marina landmarks from my window. The night view is a must to capture. I took many photos.  2. My room was‚Ä¶",5

Phase 2 HA experience at Pan Pac Club - Almost comparable to pre Covid days!!,MonkkkC,"Booked a staycay at Pacific Room with full club benefits. Unfortunately, it coincided with the 1st day of Phase 2 HA in Singapore. No dining in allowed at all dining outlets meant there won't be buffet breakfast at The Edge, the Pacific Club was closed, no cocktails served as well. The gym was also closed.   A big blow and dent to our staycay plans as previously we stayed at the Pacific Room and Pacific Harbour Studio and were always blown away by the whole Club experience. We decided to go ahead with the staycay plans after several email and phone calls with Pan Pac and being assured that most Club benefits were still being met.   From the checking in process onwards, every staff we met was friendly, cheerful and hospitable. They were patient in answering our queries and quick‚Ä¶",5
Bad experience,Escape59291546722,"Although the stay started well despite long check in times, the hotel ambience and experience was good. However ended on a bad note when I was interrupted by super loud construction noises in the unit above mine which awoke me from my deep sleep at 8.30am and lasted till 10am. This spoiled my overall intended stay for relaxation and rejuvenation. This was bad management and oversight from hotel staff to allow such construction to occur above an occupied room. This has changed my perception of the hotel brand and image and was left severely disappointed. ",2

Family staycation,reena b,"We booked a staycation at the skyline executive suite for our family of four 4 for two nights.The highlight of our stay was the very friendly staff, high tea, cocktails & the breakfast. Once we were at the hotel, It was very nice, except for the malfunctioning of the window screen which made it difficult to sleep one out of the two nights we were there for. There was way too much light coming in the room for the kids to sleep.  The biggest downside was the entire booking process & the very uninterested phone assistants. Every time I called to inquire, I was made to talk to 4-5 people & still didn't get any satisfactory response. I was asked to confirm the booking first, only then I would get any definite answers.

The pool was awesome and the kids had splashing good time. There were plenty sun beds for the adults to relax. Our boys are into chess game and were so excited when they saw the big chess at the garden. The hotel indoor architecture was beautiful and we loved the elevator.

Great Staycation top with Great Breakfast,mav68,"Stayed at Pan Pacific Singapore with my friends. It is an established hotel and they have gone through a thorough renovation and remodelling many years back.   Located at Marina Square, sits above the mall, location is second to none. I love the lobby, with the lantern shaped private seating area, makes hotel looks very trendy and chic. They used colours, mosaic and many art pieces to adorn the entire hotel, transformed the blend gigantic hotel into a hotel with an immaculate taste.  My room is generally OK, facing Suntec City and the Swimming Pool, view is pretty decent. The room is clean and neat, but the design element is starting to age. TV is huge enough viewing from the bed, and bathroom is clean and functional, with a blind to protect your modesty.  I love the swimming‚Ä¶",5
Relaxing Pacific Club room stay,Pink_Piglet,"Booked a Pacific room which comes with Pacific Club lounge access. The room is clean & comfortable and pillows are very comfortable compared to other hotels. Toilet looks a bit dated. Pacific Club lounge located at level 38 is beautiful with nice view of Marina bay as well as city views. Shine, Angel & Haris were attentive and replenish orders very efficiently.  Would have given a 5 stars if not for less than satisfactory check-in experience. There wasn't clear indication of club rooms check-in counter which understood there was one, and was directed to the wrong counter. When checking if the club rooms have Marina bay views, Instead of explaining what views are available. We were just bluntly told that we booked a Pacific king and it only comes with city view.",4
Nice staycation,Fromhome123456789,"We enjoyed our staycation and had a pleasant time at the club lounge. Do note  the enforcement for dress code for the evening cocktail was rather strict. The selection of food for breakfast at the Edge was reasonable, the champagne was the only plus point. ",4
Satisfying Staycay,cedswsa,"We checked in on 12 May and was immediately greeted by the friendly doorman that greeted us despite busy handling a food delivery person at the door.

Mr Abhi was wonderful and engaging that made the otherwise tedious checking in process a breeze. The room we had had a great view, well maintained and clean.

Worth it! Great location!,PxPanda18,"Overall experience is great. Booked the panoramic room package for staycation on klook at a great deal that included breakfast. Location wise can‚Äôt get any better, marina area is always our favourite staycation location due to accessibility to many malls, shops and transportation.  I would say the room and hotel in general needs upgrading as the amenities and system is a little dated, but overall the room was maintained well.   The sound system in the bathroom is also better than the sound output from the TV, as such able to enjoy the TV while dipping in the bathtub.

Yay to Buffet Breakfast,Raymond Wee,"What I really liked was the return of a breakfast buffet service that was quite similar to the pre-COVID experience, just that the food can only be handled out by a server at each food station.  The Pacific Club was still running a reduced a la carte service menu for the afternoon tea and evening cocktail though. Service and ambience was still excellent as always.  The Pacific Harbour Room I stayed at felt kind of old, but it was spacious and well maintained. It had good internet speed with 24Mbps download and 23Mbps upload and there were plenty of electrical and USB sockets all around. I liked that HDMI passthrough was available to view our own content.  All and all, it was a very pleasant stay.",5

Not worth the money if you have similar budget,Roam820982,The Grill food is terrible there.  The stay in the room feels like a budget hotel. Totally no-frill amenities in the room.

The upgraded room comes with an espresso machine that only offer 3 tablets of coffee. 3 For $40.   ,3
Disappointed stay,Maggie M,"We had been choosing pan pacific Singapore as our choice of staycation for a number of years now and sadly, this is the last time we are going to be there. The service at check in and check out was excellent, the room was not up to our expectations; even had to clean up the room after we used the bathtub (minor flooding). Promised a cake as it was my birthday but it did not turn up. Most disappointing part was when we were at the Edge, which I would leave it as it is now. Have already given our feedback to management and I do hope they would have done something about it. ",2

Worse experience ever,Desmond,"Booked Pacific Harbour Room with Pacific Club Benefits to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were pretty disappointed with the service as they mentioned to me that there will be birthday amenities for my wife but when we arrive there was nothing, which is ok because we can't expect much right? Another thing is that we thought the room comes with a balcony because of the photos provided has a balcony but the room we got does not come with a balcony and we were told that balconies are allocated upon requests, that's fine, we can go without the balcony. The most disappointing thing is that when we were about to sleep, we found out that the inner side of the comforter was torn badly with a big hole and this is very unhygienic especially during this pandemic, the hotel should pay more‚Ä¶",1

During my breakfast at the edge, the manager was attentive to all our needs especially when I am with a toddler.  It made breakfast much more enjoyable. During my checkout, the reception staff was friendly and most importantly the staff was attentive, when I went back to collect items that was dropped off to be kept in the fridge, she could remember and identify me.

Could be better ,nyu2n,"Stayed on valentines day and the queue for check in was terrible.  Requested  a room change after found out that the deluxe room has no bathtub. While we were waiting for the new room, some other guest went into our room. I guess the front desk team has release our current room without any further cleaning or inspection. I thought with COVID, this will be better managed. We stepped out from the room and waited outside for the staff to bring us to new room.  I would suggest to opt for at least panoramic room if you need bathtub. The view is good too. Be prepared that the swimming pool is crowded. Can't really swim with such crowd. ",4
Enjoyable staycation with 5* service ,Angela,"Returned to stay at Pan Pacific for the second time in Apr and was very impressed by the check in by Natalie though we had to queue for about 15 mins for the check in. We booked the Deluxe Rooms however the rooms look old and doesn't come with a bathtub according to the website. So we took an upgrade to the Paranomic Room at an additional cost of $40++ which was totally worth it and was given a very nice and modern looking room compared to our last stay.

Pacific Harbour Studio (Suite Stay),Cal_TheHotelLover,"Back to Pan Pacific Singapore after seeing some photos on the newly renovated Pacific Harbour Studio. Trust me, if you're into large spaces and large tubs, this is for you!   PPSG is no stranger in my group of friends. No doubt I like spending time here, but every time is always something new or memorable. The studio suite, is even better in person (although I kinda hope the view will be full view instead of 90 degrees view of the Marina Bay only.) If you have stay in PPSG before, you'll recognize the warm hospitality, the comfort in your room and the quality of the amenities. This time no change, but extra friendly services from Jayrick. Kudos to him for all the arrangements.   The suite includes a big tub (which take a long time to fill, ensure you fill it in advance to use).‚Ä¶",5

Staycation at Pan Pacific,Ms J,"Our one night stay with Pan Pacific Singapore was delightfully marked with exceptional great customer service. We were greeted by friendly front desk manager, Abhi, who professionally assisted us in checking in, and tried his best to accommodate to our various requests and enquiries.   We had brunch at Keyaki, which serves authentic Japanese cuisine. The food was pleasant to the palates. However, due to a miscommunication, there was a slight unhappiness which was quickly resolved by the manager, Vincent, who addressed our concerns in a prompt and caring manner.

The tatami floor and seats were absolutely gorgeous. We booked the entire space to ourselves, and for the whole 3.5-hours, we were served by the Japanese restaurant manager who was exceptional - very polite, detail-oriented and thoughtful.

The club access brings you stunning view of the city.. the food spread was not as sumptuous as pre-covid times but I must say it is pretty decent.   If there is one reason I'd return to the club lounge, it would be to enjoy the conversation and service of your staff Evan and the crew serving at the club access floor.

Review,karensail,Lack of trash bins and housekeeping service didn‚Äôt appear until late afternoon when we were getting the kids ready for their nap. Had to wait outside sky room for 30min with a cranky child to wait for housekeeper to do her work. Didn‚Äôt refill the necessary items. I chose pan pac as I was gifted a stay as a healthcare worker. This is my third stay and it has disappointed me.,1

Terrible Stay,Tourist-joe1981,"Hotel is clearly not ready to receive so many bookings during March School holidays so ending up a long queue for almost 2hours just to check in. Room was small and old, not much refreshment was given, internet connect was super bad.  Pool is super dirty, the pool walls and floor are slippery and slimy. Imagine the bacteria growth in the pool, simple no maintenance. No lifeguard around and with so many kids, its dangerous.  ",1
Amazing and awesome stay! Will definitely return,Cara,"Pan Pacific has always been our first choice of staycation in Singapore for a relaxing getaway due to its friendly staff and the level 38 lounge with a breathtaking view for many years, however our previous staycation ( a first since the start of the Covid) was disappointing. We are having 2nd thoughts if we will make Pan Pacific our next staycation option. What has make the difference and have made Pan Pacific our preferred hotels again, all thanks to 1.	 A staff who is professional and genuinely interested in asking feedback  during our previous Dec‚Äô20 checkout 2.

"A quiet, classy and well-designed hotel",Alyssa O,"The room was well-equipped with automatic curtains that could black out both the bedrooms and toilet. Loved that the toilet had three shower features too!   I‚Äôd like to thank Ahbi for the smooth check in and also Azminah for walking me through over the phone with finding the hotel lobby in the mall after 11pm (and all the usual entrances were closed). Really appreciate the service and comfortable stay despite the new Covid normal. Although many guests were staying over this period, it was nice to see the staff being so friendly and kind :)",5
Worst staycation ever,DancingQuin,"We understood that it was the holidays and the hotel was packed. We booked a breakfast slot upon check in for next day‚Äôs breakfast.   As we turned up at breakfast, we were ushered to the lobby view. We placed our orders and was curious as the drinks were not in the menu. We asked about the choices that the restaurant offer.   From then on, after placing our orders, we were treated invisible, not even our attempt to raise or wave our hands could capture anyone‚Äôs attention to get some dark soya sauce for my soft-boiled egg. The nasi lemak‚Äôs rice was as though it was not cooked at all.   Janice also saw us seeking assistance but decided to speak with her 2 other indian gentlemen in suits.   After waiting for 15 minutes of no availability of assistance, we called the hotel main line‚Ä¶",1
Not what it seems,renu561,"The deal I bought gives me room upgrade and some free amenity( 2 local delights) but I didn‚Äôt get any of the 2. Housekeeping was abysmal. They still left all the dirty mugs, cups and bags of rubbish in my room. Housekeeping staff is irritated and one particular staff at the edge raises his voice at my hubby for asking for a spoon. Room service is equally bad. My food trolley was left outside my room for 24 hours at least! The leftover food started to smell that‚Äôs how bad it was. The only thing fast and efficient was the check out.",1

So-So,craois,"For the price I paid for the family package, I don't think it was very worth it. Kids' activities were only happening on the weekends. Given that it's school holidays, they should have more kids activities even on weekdays.   The worse experience was at breakfast. I felt like I was eating in the canteen. Food choices were very limited, pale in comparison to pre-covid days. There were other hotels who could offer better menu even in covid times.   We were rushed to finish our breakfast within a certain time, food cannot be customised. They were all prepared beforehand and thrown onto your table. It was really a far cry from before.",3

A big thank YOU to Roxanne Caluza for personally attending to my reservation and ensuring everything was in order by the time I checked in. Got a room at level 11. Wished I had a room at a higher floor but I understood that it was not possible due to an ongoing event.  Had some issues at first on the first day when our room was not turned down at 8 pm despite 8 pm being the agreed time but eventually that was sorted out & since then, the housekeeping dept did a fantastic job of ensuring that our room was kept clean and tidy twice a day (daily housekeeping at 10 am & turn down service at 8 pm).

Staycation to feast,trvkaki,"Stayed here more than 15 years ago and during this re-visit, the first impression of the lobby was that it was somehow ‚Äúoff-focus‚Äù, probably due to the domes of Atrium at the background, giving it a clustered feeling within the same area and doesn‚Äôt give you the grand feeling of an open field like the Shang Orchard. The lobby also could do with more sofa to provide some ‚Äúfocus‚Äù and also for the guests families members to take a seat while one of them is checking in.   Despite 8-9 counters functioning, the check-in still took half an hour at an off-peak 1pm timing but hey, this was the school holidays in a staycation craze year so I was in a way lucky when they informed me to check in at a 1pm timing.

Check in was smooth with the assistance of Mr Jayrick and through his recommendation, we upgraded our room to the Harbour Studio facing Marina Bay. View was amazing, especially at night!

The personalised welcome message on the TV screen when we entered the room was a pleasant surprise and nice touch on the part of the hotel as well. The 19th floor room also gave a good view of the cityscape.  The gentleman on duty at the poolside bar on the afternoon of 14 March was also friendly and professional. Would like to take the opportunity to also commend the kitchen staff for whipping up a great dish of truffle fries to go with the Tiger Crystal.

Other than that, the bathtub is amazing and the showers are great. Did not get to use the facilities because the online system was too slow.

Checkout was 100% hassle free with the express checkout . Only issue encountered was the delivering on amenity. We received a note saying we were away when they tried to deliver. We called to request them to deliver to us again. We were in the room for more than an hour, decided to not wait. The amenity never came. This was never the case at other hotels we stayed in under Discovery brand. ",4

Beautiful and tasteful club lounge with a breathtaking view. Wonderful selection of food and drinks, especially the royal blue pacific prepared by mixologist MC Luther. But what made the experience truly exceptional was the impeccable hospitality of the staff, in particular, Ms Evan, guest service officer at  the Pacific Club. She was warm and professional.

Worse experience ever,Miguel C,Worse 5 Star Hotel ever. You could do so much better on your service area. Especially on your dinning restaurants.  Called Service One to make a reservation for keyaki but was told that it was fully booked. Was blindly transferred here and there and have to keep repeating the story over and over again for my request. Finally a staff by the name of Yi Han from dinning reservations took the call. Asked him if he could help find a place for me to dine at keyaki. Told me he would check and get the duty manager to call me @ 3pm. There was no call back at 3pm. Waited till 4.30pm as I understand you guys might be busy due to the weekends. Spoke to your Service one staff again and was told will get the dinning reservations to call back.

A Wonderful Staycation!,Its-DD,"Stayed at Pan Pacific for 2 nights from 27 February to 1 March.  Check-in was rather smooth, except for the queue as many guests were also checking in around the same time.  I am pleased with the change of practice in collecting the full payment for the hotel stay upon check-in, and allowing express check-out.  This was a great move as compared to the traditional queuing at the reception counter just for check-out.  I just need to pass my room card to the staff nearby the reception when I checked out.  This practice should continue even when one day things are back to pre-COVID times.  Ultimately the guests still need to pay when they check-out.

EXCELLENT VIEW FROM HOTEL ROOM,snaem85,"Everything during the stay was alright except during check-in when we were told to wait a while as the room we booked is not available. We had to wait for about 15 mins before getting to our room. The room had pretty much all the essentials that were required. We particularly loved the view of the marina bay from our hotel room which made us in awe. For those who needs to use the gymnasium or swimming pool, booking could be done through your mobile device which was very convenient. However, much of the gym slots for the day were taken up when I tried to book a slot at about 4pm. In gist, it was a pleasant stay besides some hiccups here and there. Needless to say, the location of the hotel is within walking distance from a number of shopping malls.",4
Keep up with the times,Dee D,"Only giving 3 stars because: 1. Check in was slow, had to wait 40mins. In comparison, Fairmont hotel had an electronic check in system which allowed guests to check in 2 days before our stay. We just had to scan the QR code generated from our online check in when we reach the hotel to get our keys. Check in at Fairmont only took 15mins. Considering Fairmont and Pan Pacific were opened around the same time.. Fairmont is definitely keeping up with the times.  2. We extended our stay from 1 night to 2 nights. Staff failed to inform us that we had to reactivate our room card therefore we were unable to enter our room past the first night. Luckily we chanced upon a cleaner who told us that we had to reactivate our card.  3. No halal food or much vegan friendly food to be found‚Ä¶",3

Compliments to Pan Pacific Staff,Jerlene,"From check in to breakfast, there‚Äôs nothing we dislike about this hotel. The service rendered by their staff was excellent, especially by staff, Nash. He approached us with a big smile on his face, despite the crowd during check in. He told us to take a seat while he process the check in procedure. After we got into our room, he called to check if everything was okay. Knowing that it was my birthday, he even prepared birthday treats for me and my family, we were deeply surprised by the gifts that were placed in our room while we were out. Kudos to all staff in PAN PACIFIC SINGAPORE! Keep up the excellent service! Big thank you to you, Nash! üëçüèª",5
Smooth check in.,Uniquelysh,"We came earlier than planned to and staff ABHI is patient and attentive. He made our check in and out comfortable and smooth. However, the paranomic room was not as paranomic I felt it would be as it was being blocked by SMBC building. The facilities at the gym , mini games corner is good; not old. The complimentary breakfast was disappointing with little to choose from via ala carte order. Hoping that it would have more range with past experiences from other hotel stays. However, breakfast was decent to eat. Hotel bed: hard but comfortable. Pillows were very soft. Hence recommend to ask more pillow! Or else risk a neck pain. Overall, this hotel is good for family to stay in. ",4
Great staycation not to be missed,lee15121512,"Great experience. Food and ambience is great for relaxation and catching up with friend. However, the pillow is too soft and low for my liking. Great customer service. Requested for HDMI cable and staff provided it promptly",4
Lukewarm food at best,bedelialow,"In room dining and even breakfast at the Edge served was lukewarm at best. Cold scrambled eggs, overcooked soft boiled eggs, burnt toast . Was expecting a nice hot breakfast only to be disappointed.  Only thing warm was the duvet, too warm in fact. Pillows too soft, sleep was inadequate and meals were unsatisfactory , wouldn‚Äôt go back there again. ",2
H.E.R.O.,1984,"Thank you appreciating the health care workers. I was able to celebrate my birthday from the complimentary  one night stay at Pan Pacific Singapore. Staycation really help us to relax and recharge. The hotel has  easy access to shopping malls. They also able to control the crowds during check in. Strict compliance to maintain social distancing by opening more receptions to attend to their bulk guests.

great stay,Wilfred L,"service from staff was excellent, room amenities were great and in good working order. bed was very comfortable. view from room was good as well. I felt very productive working from my room. breakfast can be improved",5
Think twice before booking,Esther,"Booked for 7 nights in the paranomic room with their staycay package that covers breakfast over the lunar new year period, just to relax and chill.   Room was not clean when arrived.  There were purple stains on the bathroom blinds that you lower down and around the bath tub area. Blankets and sheets weren't that clean there were blackspots and some stains. These aren't the worst , the worst was getting the make up room service u can wait for more than half a day and was not done, twice the room was not made despite confirming over their one service via the desk phone, was rolling in the same sheets for 3 nights straight. Only way to get the room made was either giving feedback via their digital concierge Mika or call the service line don't bother pressing the make up room‚Ä¶",2

Simply Amazing !!,blacXtherapy,My wonderful stay began with the big smile on the staffs upon arrival at the hotel. Check-in was a breeze with the help of Khalili & Stella although there was a long queue(probably due to the long weekend..) Was given the room on the 21st floor and it was super nice with a really nice view. Did have some minor problems with the TV but it got rectified straight away by the technician. Pool was nice and kids-friendly. We were give a pack of face masks and a hand sanitisers too. Not forgetting we were given an hour late checkout as requested. Would love to stay again. Thank you.,5
A hotel that doesn't disappoint,DionneSingapore,"Owing to the Covid situation, we decided to spend Chinese New Year at Pan Pacific Singapore and opted for 2 nights instead of our usual overnight stay.  Notwithstanding some inconveniences due to the Covid measures, we are still happy with the service and facilities.  Attention to details such as collecting payment only at check-out because of Covid and bringing new toiletries (without us requesting for it) does differentiate the hotel from others that we had stayed.  It is not our first time at this hotel, and it remains one of our favourites.",4

OVERALL STAY IS GOOD BUT MESSY IN ROOM ARRANGEMENT & BREAKFAST DELIVERY,jimong2011,"Overall the stay is good but the room arrangement is a bit messy, I happy to pay more to get an harbor studio room to enjoy nice view & I especially request to have a bathtub in shower room. However, it is not, end up I have to wait for 3 hours for the room change. It was tired long wait. The breakfast that we ordered does not deliver to our table in full. Our next table neighbor keep asking & chasing. it was another mess that we can see. I feel the restaurant is too close to other table, I didn't feel there proper social distancing measure. ",3
little CNY staycation,Kaisel D,"I stayed in Pan Pacific Singapore on 11-13 Feb 21, it was a short and sweet stay! Due to pandemic and  regulations set by the local authorities to combat COVID-19, a few things have changed but one remains the same, the service remained impeccable!   Even before I officially checked-in, I received a phone call from Mr Jayrick at about 11:00 AM to inform me that they are extending an early check-in for me since my room is already available! I was surprised since I was initially told that earliest check-in is at 2:00 PM! I wasn‚Äôt ready, but was glad to come in earlier than expected. The service from check-in was personalised and efficient. The assistance offered by Mr Jayrick to me was greatly appreciated!   As they say, it pays to pay extra, and was very true for my case!

A pleasant staycation at Pan Pacific Hotel,Q4912ZUrose,We stayed one night at this hotel. Staff were friendly and very welcoming. The room was clean and facilities were great. Breakfast were served quick and staff also served us very nicely. We surely would recommend to our colleagues and relatives to choose this hotel when they come from overseas!,4
an underwhelming 2night stay (reinforced a poor staycation experience back in 2019),Wilfred T,"yup, we were disappointed with our stay back in 2019. and yes, we came back to try again in 2020, and, again, we walked away disappointed. I guess we were disappointed this time cos we thought they have improved... but they didn't.  we did a 2nights stay this time.  the Positives: 1. Balcony had a good view (but restricted because it was a lower floor) 2. Bathroom water pressure was great for a good shower. :)  the Not-So-Good: 1. Gym: No improvements made. the machines where rubber has melted still there 2. Check-In: Long wait (not because there were alot of ppl, but it is just that, everyone took a long while. not sure why) 3. Housekeeping: room wasn't clean. we went out at 8am and asked for housekeeping. we returned at about 7pm to a room of the same state as we left it.‚Ä¶",2
Pan Pacific Staycation,Naurana,"Great stay. Started right at the front entrance, being greeted by the friendly Encik Ismail and GSE TJ. TJ immediately instructed me to park my car at a reserved lot when he noticed my crutches. Both men then assisted with my luggage, all the while showing great empathy, warmth and concern. Check in was a breeze. The rooms were clean and spacious with a gorgeous view of the harbour. Did have an issue with the TV console but was quickly rectified by the technician. The coffee machine was an added bonus, and top up of capsules was a call away. On my departure, Encik Ismail and TJ quickly assisted with the luggage, always with a warm smile and a helping hand. The first impressions of any establishment is at the entrance, and in these 2 men, Pan Pacific got it SPOT on!!!!",5

Not worth staying during this pandemic ,Vivian,"Booked 3 nights with club privileges to have a relaxing CNY without hassle to settle meals. Totally not worth paying additional price for club access. Club lounge only opens from 1pm. Left with no place to relax, except in-room after breakfast till 1pm.  Breakfast served at the edge with seating at dedicated corner which serves same food as the rest of guests with addition of champagne. I rate breakfast at the edge 3 out of 10. Braised peanuts in congee tastes sour on both mornings. Congee on day 2 was way too salty. Belgium waffle was served cold. Kind of like eating convenience food.   Tea and cocktail presentations at club lounge are quite the same for all 3 days with too much desserts. It‚Äôs really boring for multi- night stay guests.  Will not be back despite having‚Ä¶",3

Excellent hotel with great club benefits,do_be_kind,"Stayed here for staycation end Jan 2021. Got a surprised upgrade to the suite room thanks to GHA Black membership. Check in by Yun Hui was great, he is so professional and really made us feel welcome. Our smooth check out was also by him, hence the warm overall experience i must say. We were put up on L33 which has a fantastic view of Marina bay area, its just like a postcard view. Highlight of hotel has to be their club experience, one of the best i've tried. Service at club floor was great, everyone seems friendly and accomodating. Will definitely return again.",5
Soulless hotel,Skylark995,"Stayed here for 2 nights to celebrate birthday and CNY. Everything here is underwhelming not that I expected much from this brand. I know it‚Äôs the pandemic but I feel precisely that is the case for brands like this to up the game since occupancy rate is way manageable. The rooms are tired looking although the size is good. Basic hot beverages of instant coffee and TWG tea provided. To my surprise daily housekeeping is only upon request. I have stayed at other 5 Stars hotels during the pandemic in Singapore and they do provide daily housekeeping without request. I am perfectly fine with housekeeping on request, but at least make it known to the guest upon check-in.  Won‚Äôt be back at this property or it‚Äôs same branded properties elsewhere. My advice is to consider other‚Ä¶",3
Excellent service and wonderful amenities,meleesamz,"The staff were genuinely friendly and happy to serve you. Despite the pandemic, they have managed to adapt to the demands of it with the buffet service via ala carte online ordering; food gets delivered to you to your table seamlessly by choosing from a menu online. The rooms were very nice, they don't have those card slot things that turns off all the power when you take out your card and leave your room; so your room can stay cool with the AC on when you get back. The hotel is connected to a mall so you don't even have to go outside to shop or dine.  I left behind a valuable item and the housekeeping team did an excellent job; I got back my item the following day. So my faith in humanity is restored. Kudos Pan Pacific! I will be returning again in the future.",5
Excellent service ,Scully,"I have booked a suite for family staycation, and did not expect to check in until 2pm according to the allocated time slot.

A refreshing staycation,DTTP,Upgraded to a room with balcony facing MBS and city view is a right choice. This is a quiet period where we get to enjoy the pool and the gym upon booking.

A senior member at the entrance even sang a birthday song to a guest when he found out the family of the guest were there to celebrate.  The room was nice. Basic amenities provided in the bathroom. It was a clever idea to place the luggage rack in the bathroom area. Makes the bed area free of stuff.  I personally had issue with the pillows. There were four, and all went flat when i rested my head on them. Couldn't get a good combi. So my two nights were kind of restless.

Online booking of pool/gym facility for 1.5 hour duration, as well as choosing your prefered breakfast time puts you at ease that you can enjoy these peacefully without worry for overcrowding.

The location is also great, there are a ton of shopping and food options at your doorstep with Suntec City and Millennia Walk next door.  However, there were a few things that I think could use improvement:  1) Check-in policy: we called the morning of our arrival to see if we could do early check-in.

It was quite expensive for 2 nights so we expected good quality and on the whole we got it. Covid meant that not everything was available all the time but that is easily understood.,4
Pan Pacific Singapore,Aziz' N,Service is satisfactory. Location is good. Did not meet my expectation as housekeeping was not around to clean the room throughout our 3 days stay. We were put on hold on the line for quite some time when we wanted to book for a spa experience.,3
Wonderful staycation,tantzechin,"Room was quiet ,clean ,spacious and modern, bed was firm and large. Slept well. Dinner at Hai Tien luo was yummy . Breakfast nasi lemak was delicious, although I really missed the buffet selections (no fault of the hotel)  But the gems from Pan Pacific are the serviced staff , they are ones that make my stay amazing. Thanks to all of you, i had a most enjoyable time at Pan Pacific.",5
Awesome stay!,yeefei123,Clean and comfortable hotel! Great customer service. Check in was hassle free and quick. Dining experience was great too. Ambience of the hotel was classy and cosy. Overall highly recommended! Thank you Pan Pacific Singapore!,5
A lot of room for improvement,Howard_bai,"Booked a stay for 3D2N titled ""Pan Pacific Singapore Staycation with Breakfast at the Edge (Exclusive)"" via klook but was told by the hotel staff that my booking did no include breakfast because the fine print didnt indicate so. The hotel staff insists that Klook may not advertise the promotions according to what they entail e.g. while the title says there is breakfast, the fine print will indicate what is exactly in the booking.  My question back to the hotel and klook would be, if the fine print didn't mention the room booking is in Pan Pacific Singapore (which the booking indeed didn't), will I be denied a room at Pan Pacific Singapore because the venue was not mentioned in the fine print? This is misrepresentation if not highly deceptive marketing. What made it more‚Ä¶",1
Relaxing stay,Alicia,The hotel isn't brand new but very well kept and taken care of. Check in and check out were pleasant and fast. The buffet is great for breakfast and dinner. We enjoyed the pool and fitness center. The capacity at some facilities is limited due to covid so you need to book your time. All was conveniently arranged and made our stay comfortable. The location of Pan Pacific is great as well.,5
Staycation to Usher in the New Year & New Life,SamFong85,"Thank you to Pan Pacific Singapore for letting us transit into the new year, and our new lives at your hotel. We got ROMed on 31 Dec 2020, and chose to stay at Pan Pac from 30 Dec 2020 till 2 Jan 2021, as it was near to our ROM venue and had an on-going staycation promotion at that time, making it one of the more affordable choices.   Our stay with Pan Pac has been nothing short of Excellent Service and Cosy Comfort. All the staff were warm, friendly, and ready to assist whenever. From the Door Greeters (tending the SafeEntry station), to the Front Desk, to the Bell Boy, and the Housekeepers, it was a pleasure interacting with everyone.  We also loved the hotel's modernized interior and up-to-date room designs, which were all well-kept and looked current to times, despite the‚Ä¶",5
Staycation ,Mel K S,"We were fortunate enough to receive a voucher for a one night stay at pan Pacific.  Social distancing measures in place, but overall awesome stay.   PROS Many thanks to Abhi who ensured a smooth check in and gave great advice on how to book restaurants and amenities. Location is great, there is link to marina Square mall from hotel. The mall links to citilink, suntec city, raffles city, etc. Our room was great with city view and comfy beds. We slept really well! Breakfast at edge was good; instead of traditional buffet  team bring the dishes to you. Can order on phone.  CONS -Room was cleaned as per WHO standard, great. However, noted ants in coffee machine and small bugs in bathroom.  -suggest you book restaurants early, before arriving. Most were fully booked when we arrived.‚Ä¶",4
Excellent hospitality and cleanliness,Nandar K,"The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home.

New Year's Eve Staycation,cenriquez1983,"Our family (my husband & 4 yr old son) had 3 nights staycation last 29th December to celebrate New Year's Eve. Our booking was done via the hotel‚Äôs website. We booked the Pacific Club Room. It was efficient and fuss-free and received a prompt confirmation from the hotel the day itself. Was able to get a complimentary room upgrade to Pacific Harbour Room (free of charge for 1 night & the rest we have to top-up, thinking it was free for the duration of stay) but still, Thank you to Chrizel for accommodating & arranging this for us.

Unexpected from a 5-Star hotel,xuthes,"I needed ice cubes and had to travel all the way down to level 1 to collect them myself, I had to make multiple trip to level 1 to collect them as 1 bucket of ice was not enough and collecting 2 buckets at once was also not possible as 1 room is issued with 1 ice bucket. I also had to make my way to reception to collect extra cutlery that I needed. This is not something I expected from a 5 star hotel.  The food served at breakfast was also disappointing, the pastry served was stale and cold (imagine cold and soft croissant), limited choices of breakfast to choose from.  However, service from staff was fast, efficient and friendly.",2
Another Impeccable Stay with PPSG ,Cal_TheHotelLover,"A pre-christmas stay with Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore that leaves only memorable memories.   This is my second stay with the hotel, and it wowed me the second time. The last time stayed with Panoramic King room and this time book the same with a complimentary upgrade from my Discovery membership to Harbour Studio. Quite frankly, I'm not impressed by the photos online, but I kinda like the layout in the end. The room doesn't have floor to ceiling windows, but with a view and slightly larger than the previous one. The two seater sofa/daybed is a nice touch to the room too.   Expect the same amenities, same amazing hospitality. Kudos to Jayrick who handle our check-in and check-out. Love the idea to handle members check-in without the need to queue! Keep that up :) I'd say Pan‚Ä¶",5
Splendid service. Nice room & view,Sue S,"My family and I booked a stay over the weekend and was served by the Guest Relation Officer Abhi (Abhishek) who was very accommodating and went all out to cater to our needs. He made sure we had a pleasant stay. All the service staff there from the reception to the doorman at the lobby greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcomed. The room was very clean and we had a good view of the marina bay area. The only sad thing was there were very little selection of the breakfast buffet spread though perhaps may be due to covid. Other than that, all is good!",4
Great place to staycay,Raphyde,"We checked in during New Years Eve, of course it‚Äôs busy but the check in was so smooth and we didn‚Äôt have issues with checking in. Front desk staff, Stella, was accommodating and very informative with regards to the process of reservation for amenities, breakfast and the like. Pool is open and you need to book by scanning the QR code provided upon check in. Breakfast timings are divided into three: 7am-8am, 8:15am-9:15am, 9:30am-10:30am.   The quality of sleep is good, nice pillows, clean smelling beds and blankets. The staffs, especially at the main lobby, were also attentive and approachable.

NYE Staycation,Li0nHeaRt07,"Chose Pan Pacific for it's strategic connectivity between Suntec City and Marina Square, as the weather on both NYE and NYD turns out wet, the location becomes a plus point that allows us to walk seamlessly between hotel and malls without getting wet. The bed is comfortable that allows us to both rest and enjoy the NYE countdown. ",4
Pan Pacific singapor,Ashish6675,"Will not recommend Singapore Pan Pacific, the room had cockroaches and when we asked for an extra toothbrush or soap we were told we will e charged for it , given that its a 5 star and given the state of the industry one would have expected the hotel to be better than this",1
Superb view,Jasmin O,Very comfy room with lots of space! Big and comfy bed and pillows! Big bath tub! Room is very tidy! Superb view and great view of course! Plus very accommodating and helpful staff. It provided a very relaxing stay! We will definitely come back for sure! ,5
Terrible Hotel,Thomas G,1. No slippers provided 2. $3 per extra bottle of mineral water 3. $5 delivery fee just to deliver a bucket of ice to the room  What kind of service is this to charge a $5 fee just to deliver something to the room? You are more expensive than Foodpanda and Grabfood.  ,1
Very good weekend stay,goncalves,"Spent a weekend stay over at Pan pac. Very satisfactory on service, convinience of location, and the e-concierge for facilities booking. Room is very clean and wifi is good throughout. Some glitch with the e-order on breakfast which result our food were there very late. Swimming pool have plenty of deck chairs available. Will def return next time. Also special thanks for the little gifts for us (healthcare workers)",5

cockroaches seen in the room over both days,Shuhui84,"unfortunately every day when we come back after dinner we will be greeted by this breed of bug. we successfully killed the first bug on first night but AGAIN, we see another one on the second night. disappointing for a 5star to host us with such creatures. please do something about cleanliness of ur room.   avoid staying here if u are scared of cockroaches.",2

A room with a great view marred by disappointing food and service standards,MsTIny,"The room was very decent, but similar to other 5-star hotel club rooms that I've stayed in - comfortable, and clean. The view was fantastic, as it was a Harbour Club Room. My main agenda was actually chilling out in the Pacific Lounge and that was disappointing for me. Firstly the air-conditioning in the Pacific Lounge could be adjusted slightly for the afternoon when the sun was streaming in. But the most important aspect of the lounge is the service. I do not blame the staff at all, as I believe they might be  overwhelmed. But the lounge was less than half full, I believe in part due to the hotel's safe distancing measures, so I was surprised that they weren't coping. Both times (afternoon tea and evening canapes) that we sat down at our tables, it was a good 10-15 minutes‚Ä¶",2
Great Service as always,aidivedder,"Stayed for 2 nights with wife and my 3 year old son. Though the queue is long upon arrival, checking in were rather smooth and systematic. All the staffs is very warm towards us. The last time I stayed in Pan Pac was years ago and looks like their level of service has always been maintained till today.  Got a high floor room facing Suntec Convention and Swimming Pool. Room and Bathroom were clean. Wish for a bathtub but I believe it's another type of room, my boy loves Bathtubs :) . Location wise, it's one of the best in SG. Hotel is linked to Millennia Walk, Marina Square and Suntec City, it's best for every type of traveler, be it local or tourists.  We missed the Breakfast though as my boy is not at 100%. I remembered clearly the breakfast were great the last time I went‚Ä¶",5
Wonderful staycation!!,Joey C,"Friendly and approachable staffs, at counter, gym and swimming pool. Good room service. Nice and big swimming pool and gym. Apart from that, games are available and there‚Äôs a garden. Good location to various nearly shopping malls and attractions. Thanks.",5
Good stay overall but poor breakfast ,WhiteFlagSingapore,"Our room package costs more than $700++ per night and included champagne breakfast but the hotel did NOT have champagne at The Edge during breakfast. The waiter offered sparkling wine or rose instead which were much lower cost than champagne. This is unacceptable of a 5 star hotel which we still could not believe it happened.  The breakfast food was of the standard of a 3 or 4 star hotel - very limited options and the quality was average/below average. A very disappointing breakfast quality/experience at a 5 star hotel.  If possible, guests with club access should have the option to have breakfast at the pacific club. This is the usual for other hotels. Understand there may be challenges to implement this during COVID times but hope it can be considered given the higher price‚Ä¶",3

Lovely staycation,joviajace,"Great staycation experience, nothing that I would really fault. The hotel was organised in the way check in was done, prior email was also received received few days before check in of your check in slot. Upon check in, you can then make your necessary bookings such as next day breakfast slot and the high tea booking. Like the way everything is done digitally through their concierge app, I think it works well for most savvy travellers. I am keen to have my elderly folks book a staycation sometime soon so just a bit concerned they might feel lost.   Room was lovely, had a fantastic harbour view facing Padang & Marina bay sands direction. Our  package was inclusive of a high tea set and it was served at their lounge on 38th floor, it was a nice experience and you get good views‚Ä¶",5

Great Service and Food,chrlt,"We recently placed a order for Hai Tien Lo's bento sets for an important event. We had a wonderful experience with the BD manager, William, when we held our wedding at HTL the last year. We approached him to assist us with this and he was once again extremely helpful and provided top-notch service.   Our dietary needs were accommodated, and William also went out of his way to personally deliver the bento sets as we were worried about delivery delays. We really really appreciated his help with our extremely last minute order (it was placed for next day delivery).  The food arrived in thermal bags, and was very well packaged. The food was warm and every item tasted delicious despite the long journey to our location. Would highly recommend the takeaway bentos!  Thank you William‚Ä¶",5

The breakfast is good but just that the side up egg a little bit not fresh and smell weird. Overall are good. Check in and check out experience also pleasant. ,5
Wonderful experience,Tif,"Pros - Wonderful bed - Good spread of afternoon tea - Nasi lemak is good for breakfast - Balcony view of the marina bay is wonderful - Mini bar is empty (bring your own drinks) Cons - No slippers - TV in the room is a SMART TV but their software make it a normal TV  - Could be more clear with afternoon tea and breakfast that is a alacarte buffet spread - Checkout process was bad. There were extra staffs stood around reception area but they seem to be just wondering around. I flashed my room card (obvious to checkout) but they ignored. Had to wait and queue to checkout. - Calling them for any service require a fee of $5  TLDR, 5 star hotel with 2 Star service.",5

Relaxing staycation,clwl8,"Was a relaxing stay. Not our first stay the hotel. The room we stayed needed to be revitalised.

Wonderful family hotel,MohammadFahmy,"Efficient reception, and great concierge. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, with a pretty good view of Marina Bay. My only issue with the room (room 910) was that it had a pretty dusty carpet.  Location-wise, the hotel is within easy reach of shopping centres, restaurants/bars and is easily accessed by public transportation.  Due to the covid situation, the hotel was a little quiet. Which allowed us ample opportunity to book and use the facilities. ",4
Be warned - Cockroach issue!!!,Crumbsta,Please be warned - the Pan Pacific has a cockroach problem. If you look back thru reviews it‚Äôs been an issue for over a month.  Christmas staycation initially ruined by this additional guest in the bed! Manager upgraded the room - but was hard to relax for remainder of the stay. Paying for Club Access has always been a highlight and didn‚Äôt fail again this time (from a staff perspective) but sadly it did not live up to high quality expectations for breakfast in the Edge - food was cold and felt staff were overwhelmed (we opted for Starbucks for the rest of our stay). As a regularly customer - there was a noticeable difference this time. Completely understand Circuit breaker probably lead to a reduction in staff but sadly their standards have been lost with them.

Fantastic Christmas staycation ,Christine,"After reading all the reviews here, I was apprehensive and prepared for long waiting time. Called the hotel beforehand to check if they have any system in place to alleviate the long check-in issue, esp since we are checking in on Christmas Eve. They kindly informed me that I can check in anytime before 3pm and they can just process our details first and give us a call when the room is ready. Sounds good, so we reached at 11am for check in and was told that our room was already available. Awesome! Managed to get a 2pm late checkout on the last day too so really pleased on a whole as everything wasn‚Äôt too rush. Double awesome!  Breakfast and pool booking was simple and easy.

They mentioned setting up the amenities for the room and nothing was done, when I shared this with the manager, they sent a box of chocolates- sigh.

Managed to get the ice from the breakfast area, but they said they had no bottled water and asked me to see the Concierge for that!  Concierge was doing double duty checking in guests.

We were very happy and satisfied with their service; they really‚Ä¶",5
Disappointing Stay,Petrina A,"Upon arrival, our encounter with the entrance bellboy was already a first impression let down. He blatantly ignored providing any assistance, while my husband unloaded all our bags from the car and had to then approach him for the check-in procedure.   Check-in was a nightmare. We queued up with our 1 year old and 4 year old for over 30 minutes. Ironically, there was hardly any queue, we were actually just next in line. A line which unfortunately never moved for 30 minutes, a very slow process indeed.  Once up at our room, we were greeted with a pretty decent space and a lovely view. As a result, we tried to ignore those small blunders however Pan Pacific did not make this easy at all. Amenities were limited, even though we had specified 2 adults and 1 child, 1 infant during‚Ä¶",1

Would not recommend,LMJ0804,Checked in on my son‚Äôs actual birthday. Staffs was friendly and allowed us to bring presents in earlier so they would placed it in the room before our arrival.

Cozy Staycation,scissors02,"Nothing feel like home in Singapore, though not able to travel, a staycation was good enough for kids to enjoy and relax.  Pan Pacific is near to the city and everywhere still looks pretty and great to us, especially the night view, this what makes Singapore look proud in it's own way.   We hope 2021 will be a better year so that we can bring more review from other countries hotel, till then sit back, relax and enjoy the Singapore Skyline!  Thanks Pan Pacific for the terrific view!",5
Wrong Booking Made by Staff of Reservations Department,hansyyy90,"I booked a stay at Pan Pacific, for a marriage proposal. While it was a success, the experience was almost spoiled by an erroneous booking made for me by the reservations department.   Before my booking, I had written in to check if the hotel is able to help prepare a complimentary swan decoration in the room. I chose Pan Pacific, as the hotel was helpful and responsive in accommodating my request. In my email booking, I specified that I wanted to book a room with breakfast. I trusted that all would be in order, as I had faith in an established hotel like Pan Pacific. Unfortunately, the staff handling my reservation booked a room for me without breakfast.  Worse still, I only sensed something amiss when the restaurant staff told me my room doesn‚Äôt include breakfast, after I‚Ä¶",3

You can go for walk at the eco garden where u can fine curry leave, passion fruit and etc..  Overall my family had a  great time at Pan Pacific.   ",5
Turnaround for potential disaster,FannK,"This is my 3rd staycation during the December school holidays. We decided to give Pan Pacific a tryout this last round after having fantastic stays at its sister properties. Planning a staycation has been trying for us because we have to personally call the hotels of interest for room info and requests. That is because we have two teenagers with autism, so ensuring that we are guaranteed adjoining or connecting rooms is a definite must. We just cannot afford consequences otherwise. We were not very hopeful when we called up Pan Pacific reservations the first time because we were trying to secure rooms the following day, and was told that only the lower category rooms are interconnecting. However, when my husband called again, a patient and more informative staff helped us‚Ä¶",4

Harbour Studio :  Room with excellent view,nipone2002,"Booked a panoramic room for a staycation during the weekday. In fact changed a weekend stay to a weekday one. Glad that I did the change, as I started to read news of long check time due to year end bookings.  Checked in 30 min before designated check-in time. Was fuss free and without queue! Choose the complimentary upgrade to Harbour Studio and was impressed with the view! Was given the 31st floor by friendly receptionist.   Room is spacious, classy and decked in dark wooden hues. There is a large moveable table complete with a Herman Miller work chair.

Poor check-in process,Ninaz Zinkie,"What i like about the hotel: Great hotel with an awesome location and view. Helpful and polite staff.  Clean bathroom (with bidet).  Comfortable bedding and pillows.  Nespresso machine provided!  That awesomeness was marred by: Horrible check-in procedure. A huge crowd waiting to be checked-in was present at the lobby on 12 Dec. No communications with guests other than an apologetic smile from occasional staff who walks by. My check-in process took about 2.5 hrs, only to be given an alternative room because the room i requested for was not ready at the time i was at the counter. Didnt want to wait any longer.  Hotel wasn‚Äôt pre-emptive with the influx of local guests over the weekend, and didnt take on any measures to ensure smooth check in procedures. They simply do what they do‚Ä¶",3
Nasty experience with queueing being the key theme of the stay,Wrenkahn25,"Overcrowded. Was made to queue up to 2 hours to check in, then breakfast was another nightmare.

First of all, i will take into account the current COVID-19 pandemic and the impact that your hotel might have faced due to manpower shortages etc. However i will still write my review the way i experienced it.  My partner and i arrived at the hotel at approximately 3.15pm on Saturday 12/12/2020 to check-in, knowing that the check-in timing was 3pm. We were met with a line of approximately 300-400 people. Even though most of the counters were open, each check-in took approximately 10-15 mins.   We waited in line for 2 hours.

Disappointed & appalled. ,LEO_SG,The start of my first stay that so far has been nice and enjoyable was spoilt by cockroach crawling into my bed when I was about to sleep. I called the reception who send a staff to clear the cockroach which i just killed. To my unpleasant surprised the staff told me this was not the first he encounter. I request for insecticide and he told me not to spray as more roaches will come out!!   So what's the level of cleanliness does this hotel practice. I felt so disgusted. I'm not staying in a fly by night hotel. This supposed to be reputable one.   There was a hiccup initially as I'm the platinum member but was not given any welcome amenities till I've asked for it.   Get your act together!!,1
Cockroaches infested room / self service ice bucket ,Kenneth T,"Checked into Harbour Studio King room on 13 to 14 Dec 2020 for staycation.   1) Cockroaches were seen crawling around my room. Managed to video it but unable to upload video on TripAdvisor (as TripAdvisor only allow photos upload). This is absolutely unacceptable for any hotel. It shows how dirty this place is! Would you sleep in a room infested with roaches?! Made a complaint and was offered to change room.   2) Called for a bucket of ice and champagne flutes. Was told that $10 is chargeable for the service. If I want it free, I will have to get it at the cafe on level 1 on my own. Can you imagine hearing this from a 5 star hotel?! Best thing is, I was told that they do not provide ice bucket after 10pm as per their hotel policy as they are discouraging drinking after 10pm. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶",1

Easily accessible to shopping centers around but again due to covid restrictions if you walked back after 10 pm you can only go thru the main entrance and all the links from shopping centers are closed.

Not recommended. Go book somewhere else.,Tricia S.,"I do my research everytime I plan our travel. With the current sit, we had no choice but to celebrate our anniversary again in SG. We celebrated last year in MBS¬† so I thought of trying other hotel. I found Pan Pacific and thought that booking with Club Pacific privileges would be great and -- spoiler alert -- afternoon tea and evening cocktails were the only good things throughout our stay.   Our check-in was friday at 3PM since they said on the booking confirmation that they have staggering check-in times. We arrived around 3:30PM to a two long queues, about 30-40 people each.

Pan Pacific Singapore,Alan,"Think twice before u book. In general, the hotel is still not ready to host customer. 1. Check in need to wait for more than 1hour+ even with the reserve time slot.

Had good ones before in Pan Pacific Beach Road and Pan Pacific Hanoi. Pan Pacific Singapore's however was disappointingly dry and tasteless. They can do better with the fries too. And this for 41SGD (with GST).  Breakfast - Breakfast was served at Edge, even for Pacific Club guests. I was told at Reception that a separate menu will be provided for Club guests and can look forward to a Champagne breakfast.

His attitude and warmth were really top-notch - he anticipated our needs and offered practical solutions each time. I am truly amazed at his reading of guests and his friendly approach towards us.

Please convey my appreciation to Sufian for his excellent service. He really went the extra mile to delight his customers. He offered us a shawl as it raining outside and my daughter used it. When he found out from my daughter that it was a belated birthday celebration for me while I visited the ladies, he presented us with a slice of birthday cake.

In the meantime, she attempted to chase our car away!   In summary, I gathered that treating regular supporters as pests is Pan Pacific Singapore's Philosophy?!   I thought F&B outlets would be hungry for business during this pandemic period, although dine-in option is open for now, I wish to know if Pan Pacific Singapore F&B segment has exceeded their sales target and started driving customers away!

The pool area was very nice, with a poolside bar.

"Best hotel stay, ever ‚Äì Fantastic!",Steve K,"I have stayed at more than 500 hotels all over the world, and my stay at the Pan Pacific Singapore in early March 2020 was absolutely the best hotel stay ever. My wife and I booked a Pacific Harbour Room with access to the Pacific Club Lounge on the 38th floor, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and they treated us like we were royalty. The food and drinks served at the Pacific Club lounge at breakfast and again at afternoon tea and cocktail hour, was delicious and they served a good variety of gourmet food. The room itself was large, very clean, very comfortable, and had a great view out to the harbor and Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Gardens of the Bay supertrees.

Deluxe I think not,bighalders,Stayed here November 2019. Disappointed with deluxe room with balcony.  The room was tired mark's on the wall certainly not deluxe. The manager was good & bad. Bought us a drink took time to show us other rooms but no upgrade unless we paid extra.  The public areas are very nice and breakfast was good. The manager did say that upgrade had happened to the glass in the hotel so rooms would happen in the future.  However right now not a deluxe room ,3
Pan Pacific hotel,Martin B,Well positioned for the bay and a short walk to the Promenade and Esplanade MRT stops. You can exit straight into the shopping mall from the rear exit. The staff were exceptionally polite and accommodating. Hotel itself was very clean as was our room. Changi airport is a short 15-20 minutes away by taxi. Marina bay is a short walk. The central atrium of the hotel is like something out of the matrix with bubble lifts going up into the distance.,5
Fantastic visit! ,Rebecca Pickering,"Thanks to the team at Pan Pacific. We recently visited for a couple of nights and could not fault any aspect. The staff are very nice and helpful, the rooms spacious and clean. The gym is well equipped and the pool / poolside area great size. We only ate breakfast here- wide selection and very tasty. Overall, we had a 5* experience and would highly recommend for anyone staying in Singapore. ",5
"Not just great promotion, but wonderful service!",ErvinKoh,"I was informed of the free room upgrade promotion and quickly checked the website and called up the hotel to confirm (6Mar 9.36pm). The reservation lady wasn't very friendly. She was cold and did not seem interested to help me at all. I almost wanted to check out the neighbouring hotels, e.g. Mandarin Oriental, Westin, Ritz Carlton, Conrad, etc. However, I am really keen to celebrate my wife's birthday in their City Suites room, and that was why I can tolerate her poor attitude. She responded that there are 8 such suites in the hotel and it is better to check the availability at the counter upon check-in. On 7 Mar, I stopped by the hotel to confirm the availability of City Suites room. I was impressed by the professionalism of Rhea and especially the Duty Manager, Roxanne.‚Ä¶",5
Fantastic Club Lounge with Glorious Views of Marina Bay,secretlifeoffatbacks,"In March 2020, I checked into the Deluxe Balcony Room at Pan Pacific Singapore. Conveniently situated close to the Marina Bay area, the 790-room hotel offers easy access to Promenade and Esplanade MRT station as well as nearby shopping malls such as Marina Square and the sprawling Suntec City, with an air-conditioned underground connection all the way to City Hall MRT interchange station and the Raffles City shopping complex.

Prime location and excellent services,Stephan_MUE,We stayed a couple of nights in Singapore after travelling through Laos and Cambodia. Pan Pacific was a great stay in all respect. We had a view towards MBS and Gardens by the bay. Breakfast at the restaurant Edge had a large variety of all different European and Asian styles. All in all a great experience!!! - Thanks to the whole Pan Pacific team!,4
"Great location, great service. Spend the extra for Club Level",SGSmith1492,"We were in Singapore for the Lunar New Year. We selected a club level Harborview room with the buffet breakfast. The view across the bay was spectacular. The staff was always helpful and courteous.  Location was convenient for most of the things we wanted to do and there was a metro stop less than 200 m away.  The cocktails and light dinner option available up on the Club Level was really nice and there‚Äôs a great view from there as well. I recommend getting down to the restaurant for the buffet breakfast early. Around 9 o‚Äôclock, the line to check into the restaurant can get quite long!",5
A true 5 star experience,Neil W,"Everything about the hotel was exceptional. The staff were great, the breakfast buffet was sensational, the room clean and comfortable, location is close to most attractions. We would definitely stay againwhen is Singapore next.",5
Five Star Service from start to finish.,Gus_Riboldi,"Spent four nights here recently. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the service is superb. Central location close to Metro stations and walking distance to all the attractions along the Bay Area. You‚Äôll need to walk off the buffet breakfast, every type off food that you can imagine. There is a well equipped gym for those of us who need our exercise in. Make sure you try the Japanese restaurant, Keyaki, in the grounds of the hotel. A hidden gem. Food, setting and ambiance is superb.I‚Äôve stayed in other hotels in Singapore but this is definitely the best I‚Äôve experienced.",5

Fantastic Brilliant Wonderful!,DebbieB-G,We arrived early from A flight from UK and from the doorman onwards we felt welcomed and the staff were superb. We were booked into a Pacific Room and then upgraded to a suite. It was lovely. The room was clean and didn‚Äôt look tired as some hotel rooms do. We were on the 33rd floor and had a wonderful view of Marina Bay. We left our blind up at night. The view from there made you feel so good. The Pacific Lounge on the top floor is fantastic and worth paying for the room upgrade just to have this. We never made it to Afternoon Tea however cocktails and canap√©s in the evening meant we really didn‚Äôt need to eat out in the evening.   We ate Dim Sum one lunch time. It was so tasty especially the one with truffle in it!  Didn‚Äôt want to leave and will definitely be returning. Thank‚Ä¶,5
Perfect location ,Christine S,Loved the hotel! Paid for upgrade to Pan Pacific club room which was well worth it! The room had tremendous views. The tea and evening drinks were lovely.

Consistent hospitality,WelbyAltidor,"Great location next to the convenience shopping at Marina Square mall. Lots of choice for all meals during the day and a dedicated, professional staff, passionate about hosting guests from around the world. It's my go-to hotel for shorter business trip in Singapore that deliver huge value, but I could see myself stay here as well with my family. Finally, it's very convenient in taxi to drive in and out of the hotel to the best spots in Singapore. ",4

"Stunning location, stunning rooms, stunning service",Duncan M,"When our cruise had to be aborted mid way due to C-19, we found our selves ""stuck"" in Singapore for a few days in mid February 2020. Staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore turned what could have been a nightmare into one of the highlights of our lives. What an amazing place, perfectly situated in an amazing country.  While present at an uncomfortable time for the staff, they stood their places with exceeding grace and hospitality. When our reservations got turned inside out by ongoing changes, management continued to ""straighten out"" our account even after we had been suddenly flown back to Canada!  It's not cheap but the value is there in return. If you have the chance - go for it!",5
A wonderful stay in an excellent place with charming people around,AndreasRMB,"The title actually says it all. However, we would like to underline the true 5-star hospitality. Especially the cleanliness, the service and the friendliness of the very much international service team has been top of the class and even more than expected. With a tear in the eye we fly home today as the stay was so marvellous that we actually don‚Äôt want to go.  Especially mentioned shall be Charlene from Edge and Muhammad from Front Desk Lobby services - two examples of very positive service orientated workers that helped us to bridge difficulties and served our requests with excellence.",5
Worth the experience!,jessih150,"Centrally located in the Marina Bay area - it's really easy to get around to the Marina Bay Sands, Suntec shopping and convention area, even into the Orchard Road area... The views if you can get a window room are really good. I was easily able to get some great pictures of the river and all the surrounding hotels and businesses. Have to talk about that breakfast buffet. Wow. A huge spread of food across so many different cuisines - lots of choice for even the picky eater. Dumplings, curry, rice, noodles, cakes, jelly, chocolate, the staples (egg, bacon, sausage, tomato, mushroom ...) and much more. The other thing is they are great at providing a little extra something should there be a birthday, anniversary or other special event during your stay. It was an anniversary on mine‚Ä¶",5

We were on the 34th floor with a view across to the Marina May Sands and the CBD.  Rooms was spacious and comfortable, with a great bathroom, though not an enormous amount of cupboard space.

Old School Luxury,LuM,"The Pan-Pacific Singapore, I daresay the flagship property of Pan Pacific Hotels Group (which has now recently expanding their branding to include Parkroyal Collection) is reminiscent of old school luxury that is not typical of todays 5 star hotel environment.  Contemporary it is not, traditional more like. Big grand lobby with a view straight up to the ceiling (30+ floors). Property seems large and grand upon first glance.  Check-in:  Quick, and improved such that the paperwork is on an iPad. Coming in during the period of COVID-19, a quick declaration was needed which did not take long at well.

Return stay after 11 years!,VincePayne,Returning  to this hotel after a previous  visit 11 years ago proved to us just what a fabulous  hotel this is!This time our stay was at the end of a three and a half week multi  hotels cruise and train trip. We loved this hotel and it was our favourite  of the hotels we stayed  at on this trip. It has very spacious  communal  areas and since we were last here has had a major upgrade  qnd was very impressive.  The rooms are extremely  comfortable  with excellent  bathrooms ours didn't  have a great view but it was a corner  room so was extremely  spacious.

Large open atrium and narrow walkways to the rooms. Elevators are glass walled forcing to to stand as close to the door as possible.",4
Monetizing Coronavirus epidemic: Refuse to give refund/extend Hotel Credits after flights got cancelled,Eric L,"In early Jan, 2020 we booked our stay with Pan Pacific Singapore (and a few other countries) for our Asia vacation in late March. As the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak became more serious, our flight from LAX to Asia got cancelled by American Airlines. Subsequently, our connecting flights in and out of Singapore also got cancelled/delayed as well. Every major hotel chain in Asia did not hesitate to provide a full refund back to my credit card due to the epidemic outbreak (all non-refundable rooms).

Not up to standard,Toon,"We stayed for 5 nights in a club room . The room itself was very small with only 1 chair and a desk chair. The wardrobe hanging space was very cramped , enough for 1 person .   The club lounge was a nice room but the breakfast was a disgrace .  Just a hot plate with a chef cooking sub standard eggs .  The fruit selection was extremely poor and un varied . Probably the worst club breakfast we have ever had .  You can eat in the normal breakfast room but it was packed and very noisy .  All in all we were very disappointed and would not use this hotel again .",3
Sweet Singapore stay,John,Great hotel with all the luxury expected and great staff. Location is super with easy walking to many or the major attractions.

Excellent breakfast with amazing options for every palate. Loved our stay and would recommend this venue to friends. Hope to make it back one day.,5

The space for the cocktail reception was quite limited. There were instant photo booths and game machines to entertain the officers and the limited space appeared packed and crowded.   The ballroom was quite large and the stage was central. The sound system was excellent. The food was sumptuous.

I stayed in the pacific club room, with pacific club access and the amenities were equal to or exceeded any other ‚Äòclub‚Äô offering in many other hotels in Singapore. I travel here 2-3 times a year and have sampled several.  To be fair to people considering this hotel, the room size is very good for a ‚Äòclub‚Äô level room, the bathrooms are ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô and I did have an issue with a broken toilet seat and the shower mixer setting control which was faulty, but maintenance was on to it within minutes and both were repaired/replaced promptly, (I was on the way‚Ä¶",5

The Gardens are fantastic by day and the light show at 7.45 is absolutely amazing as the Big trees light up in time to music. Follow that with the Marina Bay light show(8.00/9.00) and eat at the Merlion Park restaurants and you will have a perfect night out within a short distance from the hotel.

On arrival at 9am  following a 13 hour flight we found the room was already available for us which doesn‚Äôt happen very often. The amenities were all first class and it very quickly showed why it is a 5star hotel. As with a top class hotel you expect to pay a bit more for food and drink, but to be honest it wasn‚Äôt much more than bars and restaurants around the city. Our room on the 21st floor gave fabulous views of downtown Singapore. The bed was very comfortable although I was that tired after the flight I would have slept on a wooden bench. The room came with mini bar and the usual room service. Breakfast was extra but it was plentiful to feed the day ahead sightseeing. As a five star it was great value for money‚Ä¶",5

This was my first time staying at a Pan Pacific property and as I‚Äôve heard so much about it, we wanted to try it out - not disappointed and highly recommended! ",5
A most memorable experience,Manikandan Venkataramanan,"The Pan Pacific must arguably be the premier hotel in Singapore. With excellent rooms, kind and courteous staff and first class service and amenities, it made my first business visit to Singapore an enjoyable experience  I shall be taking memory snapshots of the wonderful stay here and wishing you the best of luck to continue with your sterling efforts  Special mention must be made of Mr. Shawal Bin Musa who very kindly assisted me on one occasion  Regards Mani Venkat",5
Pan Pacific Singapore,SueHobby,"Nice hotel.....dont pay for buffet breakfast.....it at the a la carte on ground floor ""pacific fair"" I think its called...as far less people , quiet and far far cheaper if just after basic breakfast...Buffet breakfast is 113.00 singapore dollars for 2 adults ...if not booked with room.",2
Birthday stay,Christine R,"We arrived at the Pan Pacific at 9am, our luggage was stored for us and we were directed to the swimming pool complex where there was a guest lounge. We showered, had a cup of coffee and ventured out into the heat of the city. The hotel is in a good location near shopping malls with air conditioning. On returning to the hotel we were given our room keys. We had a club room with a birthday card and fruit basket for my husband. A plate of delicious cakes followed. Breakfast was buffet style with healthy options and chefs on hand taking requests.  We also had access to the club lounge, though as I hadn't packed shoes I could not attend the cocktail hour, however we both had the afternoon tea which was delicious and the staff were friendly and polite. Cocktails in the lobby bar were‚Ä¶",5
Wonderful pre cruise visit!,Mrsct2008,"Hands down, one of the nicest places to stay! We were fortunate to have a beautiful club room overlooking the bay during chinese new year. Staff members were accommodating,respectful and just plain lovely. It made my week in Singapore extra special. ",5
Staff Assistance ,Leigh S,We were very happy with assistance provided by Shawal Bin Musa when we checked out at Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel. We have always had excellent service each time we have stayed here because of its central location to the city.,5
"First visit, overly satisfied",Kaustabh C,"This hotel became our first choice primarily because of its location - Marina Bay, Gardens by the Bay, Merlion statue, etc. are within 2 kms radius. Secondly, it's connected to Suntec City mall from where you can easily get a bus to commute to/from Singapore Zoo/ Safari and other attractions.  Only after we checked in, we realized that there are many more things to appreciate about this hotel apart from location and connectivity. To begin with - extremely helpful staff in the front desk and concierge willing to go that extra mile to help their customers. Secondly, their service desk - you need something just dial 0. Someone would be  there within minutes to your help.   Lastly, and probably the best part - breakfast in there in-house restaurant Edge. There are wide variety of‚Ä¶",5
Highly recommended,Cindy Z,"Nice locatio, nice room, very convenient, Counter people are very helpful, you could just go the other side road direclty to shopping mall.   very handy to everywhere, enjoy and will definitely come again. ",5
Pan..tastic!!,janeT5417VB,We have just spent 3 nights in the Pan Pacific and what an experience - the surroundings are beautiful but it is the staff in this hotel which really make the experience extra special. I must give a special mention to Shawal Bin Musa who saw us struggling with luggage and went out of his way to help us - I must also mention the staff in the breakfast room at the Edge restaurant who greeted us every morning with great courtesy and a smile üòä  the location of the hotel is great and it is only a small dander to Raffles for the essential Singapore Sling!! would highly recommend this hotel.,5
In the shadow of the Ritz Carlton but no slight intended,FrankCGlazer,REALLY a pleasant surprise; great location and the rooms are fabulous. The buffet breakfast is world class; sooooooo much to choose from. No need to stay at the Ritz unless you want to spend more money. ,5
quality as expected,jwrde,"big hotel crowded with Singapore tourists and business guests. room ok. pool ok. nothing to criticize. breakfast okay: big location with vast breakfast buffet for people from all over the world, no problem with the service at the table. situated in typical Singapore environment: MRT, bus stop, shopping mall",4
Location & Comfort!,immelek,We stayed in this beautiful hotel three nights. The bed was very comfortable! The room was well appointed with an awesome bathroom. The location was perfect! The hotel connected to the Marine Mall and it is across the street from the huge Suntec City Mall. The Hop on Hop Off bus was across the street too. It staff was very friendly and helpful. It was perfect!,5
Fabulous hotel,hazel l,Stayed here for two nights in December on the way to Australia. The hotels location is great and our room had fabulous views of the Marina Bay sands and the bay. The hotel is connected by a walkway to a shopping mall right next door. It's only a couple of blocks away from Raffles hotel. We used the 56 and 57 bus to get to little India. Hotel concierge staff and doormen extra helpful. Would definitely stay there again.,5
Excellent Resort-like Hotel for Vacation,CapeLewis,"Beautiful hotel!  Our room on the 32nd floor was brilliantly designed with access to the Club Room on the 38th floor.  The pool and gym facilities were great and the staff was incredibly hospitable, friendly and helpful.  Edge Restaurant for dinner was amazing.  I highly recommend this hotel, which is a short walk to Gardens By The Bay.",5
Great location and superb view from balcony,Georgia M,"The hotel has a fantastic view; great amenities; loved the balcony; it was very clean and quiet; technology was evident everywhere; loved the spacious shower, and the design of the bathroom space. When the front desk was called, they always addressed me by name and were extremely accomodating.  ",4
End of cruise stay,gillianandmau,This hotel was booked for us as part of a cruise package and all we can say is that the choice was perfect. The staff were excellent in all departments and although we are not really buffet food fans the food was very good and value for money especially if you pre pay on check in.,5
Wonderful place to stay in Singapore,Peter S,"My wife and I stayed here with another couple for four days.  We got the breakfast package - an excellent option as the breakfast buffet is an amazing spread of food from multiple cultures that seems endless!  The hotel is in an excellent location, though because it is surrounded by huge shopping malls it might not seem that way.  But taxis are easy and there are two subway stations (the system is easy to use) nearby, one a 5 minute walk north through a mall and the other about three minutes walk outside to the south.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed, with excellent amenities.  The staff is especially gracious and helpful.  We had a deluxe room with a view of the harbor and a nice balcony, and it was worth the small price upgrade.  With the malls nearby there are‚Ä¶",5
Great Location,Sue K,"This hotel is well presented, clean and spacious. We enjoyed the breakfasts and having drinks in the bar. Room service was awesome, takes a while though. The hotel is well located close to shopping malls, and other attractions like the gardens and Marina Bay Sands.",5
Convenient,ReluctantReviews,"Beautiful lobby Lovely room, comfortable bed Interesting bathroom, it had a full window into the shower and bathroom from the main room - took awhile before we found a button for a screen. Our ‚Äúcity view‚Äù room consisted of a view of the swimming pool and we were so low that the only ‚Äúview was the surrounding high rises without any sky???  And don‚Äôt forget the window not the bathroom that was in full view unless you closed the curtains or find the screen button! Lobby beautiful, bar quite nice, bartenders attentive and friendly. Very strange - they have a lounge on one of the upper floors that we wanted to go to for drinks but apparently we were not on a high enough floor to be allowed to use it - even though our room was to be a ‚Äúview room‚Äù. Go figure.",4
Excellent hotel with great location,Mango60,"Upon arrival, there was a lot of people checking in, but the front desk for checking out helped us directly. Efficient and professional.   Our room (clubroom) was on the 34th floor with large windows overviewing the Raffles hotel, the cricket field and Singapore river. Nice sized room with plenty of storage for the clothes. A bathroom with both a bathtub and a separate shower and toilet.   The lounge is on the top floor with 360 degrees view over Singapore. From here you can see Singapore river, downtown or all ships. Take your choice. Breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks with snacks are served here including real Champagne. The staff here is terrific!   There are several restaurants within the hotel to choose from or plenty within walking distance.   There is a pool area‚Ä¶",5
Great hotel for a stopover,Rosie B,"We had booked this hotel 4 years ago for a stopover from Australia to UK but our plane was diverted via Japan instead.  The hotel was very good about us cancelling at the last minute so we promised we would book with them next time.  This was honouring our promise and so very glad we did.   Arriving jetlagged and tired the reception staff were lovely and even upgraded us to a fab room with wonderful views of the city.  Special mentions to the concierge and the lovely man who greeted us both times as our taxi arrived (we stayed on our way back from Australia as well) .   Breakfast particularly good with all pallets and tastes accommodated - you could have anything from curry to omelettes, chinese cuisine to sprouts!   We will definitely stay here again when we next head down‚Ä¶",5

Don't Expect a 5 Star Hotel - Families looking for 5 star - Stay somewhere else,C.Richmond,"We are a family of 8 travelling through SE Asia for 6 weeks with 2 parents, 2 grandparents and 4 younger children (3,5,8,9).   Being our first stay in Singapore, we weren't too sure where to stay to maximize the walking to attractions, restaurants, and malls. My wife and I couldn't book the 'front' bay hotels as the only rooms left were $1500/night and we couldn't justify it for the 1 block difference in distance.   I mistakenly booked the wrong dates for 1 of the 2 rooms directly through their website; one club suite and one 'regular' room. The grandparents are leaving back to Canada and we are continuing to stay in Singapore for a few days. I called immediately after the mistaken date was booked, to be told nothing could be done and to send an email. The hotel would not allow‚Ä¶",2
Lovely Stay,1Joybelle,"We returned from our cruise to stay a few days here. The a staff are extremely helpful and friendly.

"Terrible check-in experience, expectations certainly below standard expected.",brobinsonau,"Dear Pan Pacific Team, Despite being incredibly excited about staying at your hotel, we were very disappointed with the following aspects: - Although we booked through your website, during check in we were informed our reservation did not exist.  After providing a printout which I had luckily kept, and showing emails between myself and one of your guest relations personnel prior to arrival, the booking was remade for our stay.  Check in took around 30 minutes while the problem was sorted out, not an ideal way to start after a long flight from Melbourne. - Our reservation included a childrens amenities kit.  This consisted of one cheap penguin toy, which is not an amenities kit in my view.  Further, the stitching fell apart after one day. - The booking included turndown service,‚Ä¶",2

Perfect location to tour the City,Darryl UK,"Out of our short list of where to stay, Pan Pacific was decided. As we had never been to Singapore we didn't know which was a better choice. We were so pleased we chose Pan Pacific. The hotel is modern, clean and has all the amenities you would expect.   We did have a problem with the room next door using their mobile phone on the balcony in the early hours of the morning. reception swiftly sent someone up to end it. In the morning we requested an alternative room and The lobby ambassador Shawai dealt with very quickly and was always happy to help with whatever we asked of him.

Caught the train to Gardens by the Bay and walked around during the day. Had a bite to eat then on to the night which is breathtaking, mesmerising night show the Gardens put on every night (?). After walked over to the Marina Bay Sands for a look and eat - fabulous. Upstairs and on top of the MBS walked right around on the rooftop (?) which has the most amazing views of harbour and the CBD. This led us to the Science building then the beautifully lit up bridge over the harbour and next to the Grand Prix stand. Continued walking around up to the entrance to get back to Pan Pacific.

Amazing Hotel Amazing City,MIKE J,"We wanted to spend New Years Eve in Singapore to see in the New Year with the fireworks. We were amazed by hotel, it‚Äôs perfect location to get out and about, our room, the food and the hospitality given at the hotel. We know requests can‚Äôt be guaranteed but we really wanted a balcony room overlooking the bay so we could watch the fireworks. When we arrived our perfect room still hadn‚Äôt been vacated so we had to wait a couple of hours. But it was a wait worth waiting for as our views were amazing. The Breakfast was varied with plenty of choice. Would highly recommend this hotel and we will definitely return. We stayed for 4 days and still didn‚Äôt see everything this amazing city has to offer.",5

Luxury hotel,minnesotans4,"We stayed 3 nights in a Pacific Club room which was on the 33rd floor.  I would highly recommend spending extra to stay on the Pacific Club level for the sweeping views of the harbor and access to the stunningly beautiful Pacific Club Lounge for complimentary breakfast which included a buffet plus ordering off the menu, afternoon tea,and evening cocktails and appetizers.  The cocktails weren‚Äôt the standard well drinks but delicious Singapore Slings for starters.

Fabulous hotel,Masami M,"We stayed in a suite for 7 nights. Rooms were huge and very well appointed.

We also had room service one night....Hainan chicken and char kway tweoh were the best is anywhere in Singapore, and far better than at the hawker centres. Could not fault the hotel for food.

Disappointing start....beautiful hotel...fantastic location...awesome staff,smz7811,"We had booked the Pacific Harbour Studio room months in advance and had requested 2 things. Early check in and room with balcony. Upon arrival around 1pm we were unfortunately told our room still wasn‚Äôt ready. How sad considering this room type gives you VIP status but couldn‚Äôt be ready after so much notice was given.  We then got our room eventually, and yes it had the balcony we requested, but it was completely outdated compared to the pics on the net which we used as guidance to book the room. Instead of a newly renovated room and bathroom, we got an outdated bathroom that looked like it was last renovated in the 80‚Äôs. The carpets as well were worn out and dirty. A reminder that we paid a pretty penny for this high end room so it left us feeling disappointed. The next day‚Ä¶",4

Highlight was trip to Old Ford Factory museum. Would love to go back to city and hotel.,5
? Is quality declining,Eve,"We booked city suite for 7 nights over NYE period and this is my third stay.   We just returned from Beijing (Hilton Beijing Wang Fu Jing) and the differences are obvious.  1. Our bathroom had mould.  2. The second toilet sink tap is leaking 3. Poor housekeeping standards - yes we have a 3 years old so I don't expect 100% as it is unfair , but I at least expect the the dirty plates are cleared , miscellaneous rubbish is off the table and at least the sink is wiped and cleaned. 4. We found the Edge buffet spread is always excellent- but perhaps due to high level of crowds- less personable.   We are slightly disappointed as we had an excellent stay last year but regardless  will always consider Pan Pacific Hotel due to its excellent location but I am not sure if I would choose to‚Ä¶",3
Family holiday,Brian M,"Be careful booking & paying 100% upfront with this hotel - upon checkin, what we had paid for could not be provided and hotel seemed to be in no position to offer what was paid for. Room was not ready at checkin time of 7pm nor was room ready at 2230 despite two phonecalls to reception seeking the second bed for our child who, exhausted, ended up sleeping in the main bed on our first night. It seemed we had two options at this point; continue in 'dialogue' with the hotel and let it consume us or try to 'make do' for the reminder of our stay on our once in a lifetime trip to Singapore. We chose the later. Location was ideal for us and after the above, our experience with all the other members of their staff was perfect",2
Holiday,Tour172568,"We booked a room with upgrade and breakfast. Poor marketing by the hotel. Read the fine print - if you book a  room with a up grade you may not get it, even if you did book months in advance and forced to pay in advance to claim the best price and special offer.",3
Poor New Years Eve Effort,Allan C,"Booked for all included NYE bash with friends. What a disappointment that regular spirts like Jim Beam were not available neither were beer choices.  Pretty sad state of affairs for Pan Pacific.  Even towards the end of the night (circa 1am) the drinks were cut back.  NYE at Pan Pacific for the money next year? Nah, give it a miss.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, most of the staff were superb but I knew something was amiss when spotted early arrival of couple who departed after about an hour.....  Nope from me.",2
Perfectly Lovely Hotel,Hope B,"This was a lovely hotel located in a very convenient location.  The room was lovely.  The bathroom was lovely.  The service was lovely.  The meals we ate there was lovely.    We didn't find anything about our three nights there special and I think we expected to.  Everything was just.... lovely.   Overall, it was a nice hotel and we would have no problem staying there again for the right price.  The value wasn't there for us because by the time we chose a room with an upgraded view we could have stayed at the MBS for a little more, which is what we'll do the next time we are in Singapore.",4
Wonderful location and good service.,Phillipe I,"I booked a room with 2 single beds and sent an email to confirm this need. However, upon check in they said there were no rooms available with this configuration. They upgraded to a larger room with a queen size bed and a sofa bed. However, the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable and I had to request a room change. Finally, they put us in a room with 2 single beds without balcony because in my reservation there was a balcony as I had booked. Anyway, my expectations with the hotel were not so satisfactory for its high price.",4
Staycation,Janice M,Specially booked Pan Pacific to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. Made the booking via Agoda and requested for high floor and baby cot as well as indicated that it was for our wedding anniversary. Not too sure if my request was fully communicated to the hotel as only the baby cot was provided and was allocated 5th floor to stay. The check in process was abit long perhaps due to weekend. Would have been a nice gesture if the hotel provides a cake to commemorate our wedding anniversary but the hotel did not.  Nonetheless it was a pleasant stay and the breakfast was good,4

We were told to wait for our room as our room was having some maintenance and yet to do the housekeeping.

There were not many people at the bar, yet we have to wait for about 15 ‚Äì 20 minutes for our drinks!

Great location and value,Yuri K,"We enjoyed our staying in Pan Pacific! The location, breakfast, staff and rooms were great! It is worth adding breakfast when you book the hotel. We booked one King bed and double bed room without knowing they were on different floors. When we checked in, one of the reception staff helped us to find connecting rooms together and we were upgraded to the panoramic view rooms. Early check in was not an issue either. ",5
Pan pacific review,Isiah D,"Deluxe room was excellent. Staff in the lobby were always happy to help out. Great selection of restaurants in house if that‚Äôs your thing or the Suntec city mall connects directly from the hotel to the MTR for a cosy aircon walk, before hitting the street for some outdoor eats.",5
Nice services and comfortable place,Ella709,"Staff are very kind to suggest a room upgrade for nice river view with a reasonable price. In the balcony, signature buildings of Singapore are mostly able to be see. Bed are comfortable for sleeping. Staff in the hotel restaurant are nice and did the bet to serve customers.",5
Grande Prix,TBE,"As far as central positioning it was great. The Lobby Cocktail Lounge was amazing as were the service staff. The food and cocktails delicious.   The customer service at reception could do with some serious attention. The suite while spacious was old, tired and very worn.   Arrival- asked to hand over new credit card so they could take out the whole accommodation fee of $6k? Why you ask if it had been prepaid 4 months prior in full? Apparently the new credit card was not the one the payment had been made with which was no longer valid but the new card was the same just ‚Äònew‚Äô. Not sure this makes sense?  We agreed but handed it over anyway with the assurance they would credit the original payment.    So on the 5th night at midnight we receive a note wanting payment of hotel‚Ä¶",3
Lovely stay,Diane B,"Choose this hotel for a staycation for the brand and  it‚Äôs location.Had a restful stay ,booked a Club room which was excellent.Enjoyed the afternoon tea and cocktail hour.Beautiful lounge with an amazing view staff are friendly but not intrusive allowing visitors to sit and relax for ages if they wish too.Location perfect for the Gardens by the Bay etc A lovely gesture was that on my check out day I was able to enjoy the club room tea one last time.",5
December 2019,glengifford,"5-night stay as part of a longer multi-stop trip, so it was good to compare this property to several others around Asia. Booked a Pacific Harbour Studio and that was the only disappointment of this visit - the room did not resemble the website‚Äôs photos, which seem to show a refurbished version. Our room was tired and although clean, looked nothing like the one advertised, which was a big shame. Also at the time of our stay, floor 35 had half of the rooms replacing their windows, which was not brought to our attention at any time prior to our stay, simply a letter left in our room explaining this. The noise created by the workmen was not too intrusive in all fairness however getting to / leaving the room and having to negotiate past workmen in and around the rooms opposite was‚Ä¶",4
Pleasure at Pan Pacific,lozza1957,"This is our second stay here and always find the Staff to be friendly and helpful.Recommend staying in a ""Club Room"" as the extra benefits are with the extra money.Close to shopping Centre and Metro Station.",5
Shout out to Breakfast Manager!,likest0travel,"The Pan Pacific is well located, and rooms are well appointed.  Reasonable sized rooms, and nice communal areas.  There are so many hotels in Singapore, and not much to distinguish between many of them frankly.  This hotel appears popular with air crew, as we saw many during our stay.    We happened to mention that we had vegans in our largish party, and the manager of the breakfast buffet arranged for us to have some additional vegan dishes made (as is common in SE Asia, vegan and vegetarian options are fairly limited, even at breakfast). He organised some splendid additional vegan dishes for our table, which was much appreciated, so a special shout out is much deserved for that good level of service.",4
Fantastic service by William and his team,chrlt,"We recently held our wedding dinner at Pan Pacific's Hai Tien Lo. We were most grateful to the BD manager, William Koh, who was extremely helpful and provided fantastic service. William was always contactable and ready to provide recommendations whenever we needed some help. We really appreciated that he went out of his way to make sure that everything went smoothly. The food at Hai Tien Lo was excellent, and so was the service provided by Kelly and her team. A special shout out to Kelly, who was very personable and made sure that our guests were comfortable. We are extremely glad to have chosen Pan Pacific/Hai Tien Lo for our wedding as the professionalism and service displayed by William and his team made the event such a success. ",5
Great Location ,Edward D,My wife and I stayed here for our Singapore portion of our honeymoon. The location was great. Connected to a mall and walkable to Marina Bay and other attractions. The hotel presents an image of luxury and it was great.,5
Great Choice,OzSooty,"We chose a room with Pacific Club access and this proved worthwhile. The hotel room itself was spacious and on a high floor. Great King bed and curtains did a good job of keeping the room dark. Bathroom has separate bath and shower, and a WC which, while in the bathroom, has its own frosted glass door. Breakfast was included and could be taken in the Club lounge, or for the full buffet selection, in the main breakfast restaurant. The Club lounge is on the 38th Floor and has excellent views. There are several dining/bar options to suit those who like to eat in the hotel.   We rarely use in-room dining in a hotel, and dislike the usual 'tin lid over the plate' delivery used.  But when forced one night to use it here, the meal was delivered on a trolley with built-in 'hot-box' - a‚Ä¶",5
Nice stay with great view of Marina Bay Sand,Aunti Shirley,"First time in Singapore with family, it's a nice hotel with great view of Marina Bay Sand.  We enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea there, Pacific Club lounge has also got 360 degree view.  Staff are helpful and polite.  Great hotel !",5
Xmas Staycation,Erica May May,"Had decided to check in for a night Xmas stay. Despite being festive and busy period, service was not compromised with prompt room service upon our requests. Breakfast at the Edge was not disappointing. Had visited before for buffet lunch, food quality was as usually good and with much variety.   Hotel rooms & facade was visible refurbished. Very unique hotel setting.  Room was spacious with good bedding. May suggest to consider looking into better pillow menu options for a better experience.  Some reconsiderations maybe put into place with regards to the bathroom tap. Its really rather awkward on the positioning of the tap vs the basin.   However, overall experience was pleasant and good. Will return again. ",4
Lovely view ,Erna,"Such an amazing experience staying at @panpacificsingapore üòçduring my visit at Singapore. Lovely interior building, and connected to marina square mall. . From barcony can see those lovely view of Singapore, 1km less to esplanade theater and Merlion Park, Super convenient..‚ù§Ô∏è during the Christmas season, there are giant Christmas tree in the Lobby, must took photos. Swimming pool Was white and clean.  My room has a Amazing view to Marina Bay sand and Merlion Park. ",5
Pleasant Stay ,ltravelsagain,"We had a staycation to celebrate a special occasion. The VIP services team was kind to send an amenity of some macarons and desserts with a card. The room was also on the high floor, although not facing the Marina Bay, it had a gorgeous view.   Check-in by this male receptionist with braces was smooth. (Jun Hui?) He was courteous and spoke at an appropriate pace, explaining the facilities and recommending a harbour view room with a bathtub which we politely declined.   The bathroom was spacious and I love the ‚Äúbench‚Äù and 3 types of shower head. The massage function was nice and the toiletries smells lovely too.   We used the pool area which had enough sun beds. I had hoped that there would be more adult floats to play around with.   I was expecting a turn-down service‚Ä¶",5
Underwhelming from start to finish ,Eric C,"Tried Pan Pacific for a staycation with my wife as we‚Äôre expecting a larger group of overseas guests next year. We heard great things about it, from the great service, great food and the spacious rooms.   After our stay, the only thing that ticked was the last one, spacious rooms. While the room where spacious, we got a single upgrade to a Harbour Studio (eligible for double as Black member, however it‚Äôs Christmas it‚Äôs understandable though a Club Room was available when checking online during check-in) and bed was comfortable and the view was great (see picture) there is nothing else positive to say about our stay.   - Breakfast (at Edge) was a complete mayhem/disaster. We were lead to a dark corner table first, if my wife wouldn‚Äôt have asked to a brighter table we would have‚Ä¶",2
Pan Pacific Hotel,Roger L,A good well situated hotel close to shops and tour‚Äôs airport 30 minutes away docks about 20 mins  Watch out for taxi rip offs only use registered beige and a colour roof metered taxis lots of choice for food in connected shopping mall,4
Disappointing ,IslanderWC,This is our third visit to Singapore and the Pan Pacific was by far the worst hotel we stayed in. We found our suite to be rather grimy and has a damp smell. Unlike all the other hotels this hotel charged us for a early check in even though the room was ready. After our first day of sightseeing we returned at 11pm to find our room had not been serviced. We can definitely not recommend this hotel to travelers. ,3
Great location and grand hotel,Michael A,"When looking for hotels, we knew we wanted to stay around the marina Bay Area. This hotel was perfectly located to wander around. The rooms were large and clean, and the breakfast buffet was amazing! Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get a chance to make use of the pool, but it looked great! The gym was also very well equipped by hotel standards. I would definitely recommend staying here. ",5
Great Hotel with excellent service and a good location,gerritlengerke,We just stayed for two days in the Pan Pacific and i have to say i was very impressed with the service and staff. Very friendly and professional. Also the location of the Hotel is great and the rooms are modern and luxurious. I can just recommend to pay a bit more for the lounge access on the 38th Floor. ,5
Wonderful family trip in Pan Pacific,M. Choi,"We had a fantastic Christmas vacation in Pan Pacific Singapore.  One good memory of this hotel, Mr. S. B. Musa helped me to use the swimming pool even though I checked out on last day of our staying. So we could stay more in this great hotel before we left.   Thanks to Pan Pacific. I will be fan of Pan Pacific.",5
An excellent stay!,Joy H,Lovely hotel adjacent to Marina Square shopping mall and close to Marina Bay. My room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. I liked everything about this hotel and would stay there again. ,5
MUST STAY HERE!!,Sarah S,"This hotel was amazing from the moment we pulled up outside. A very warm reception, staff are friendly and approachable. The rooms are very generous in size with great views. Breakfast catered for everyone with an international buffet experience - amazing food. Definitely will be staying here again next time...I wished we could have stayed longer!!!",5
Excellent place for family staycation.,FellowTraveler789400,We stayed at a City suite with connecting deluxe room.  This provides comfortable space for a family of 4 (parents with 2 grown up teens) and the connecting room makes interactions a breeze.  The hotel is well linked and sheltered to the nearby malls and mrt stations so it's possible to visit alot of places on rainy days without getting wet.,5
Lunch,SSS,Was a nic lunch . The quantity was v little. But tasted good. Nic ambience. Can go once to experience the food. Friendly staff. Would be nic for official lunch: or dinner. Definitely an executive price !,4
The right place,Glyn Connick,"A 4 night stay at the Pan Pacific. I wanted a big city hotel 4* plus in a good location for a sight seeing visit to Singapore.  I wasn't disappointed. Location, spacious and clean room.  Transportation is all there, tour buses, city buses, Taxis and MRT. But I suggest you do a bit of walking, a lot is within 30 minutes along safe walk ways, paths and bridges as long as you do your homework.",4
 Superb Hotel,Chris G,"Stayed here for 3 nights while visiting family in Singapore. Spoilt for choice when selecting hotel, went for this one because of its location and what appeared good value for money, and it certainly was. As it was a special trip to celebrate Christmas early with family we chose a Pacific Harbour Studio, this gave us amazing views of Marina Bay and access to the Pacific Club Lounge which was situated on the 38th floor and had 360 degree views of Singapore. Here you could get complementary champagne breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails with canap√©s. Definitely worth paying the extra when they are serving Taittinger Brut and Laurent Perrier Rose as the House champagnes! Our room was stunning with a separate sitting area, huge bathroom and dressing room. We ate in the‚Ä¶",5
Pan Pacific Singapore Pacific Club room,Monty,Best hotel I have ever stayed in. A pacific Club room is a must. The room and bath room are amazing. Cocktail hour in the evening was incredible. The view from the Pacific Club over the city at night and the light show  have to be seen. Quality of service was outstanding and nothing was to much trouble especially  when we were given an early check in without asking. The hotel is close to the MRT and other facilities  ,5
Fantastic Property Very Close to Marina Bay Sands,_aswinunnikrishnan,"I stayed at this property for three nights and must say I was mighty impressed. We arrived early, and since the rooms were not ready we were lead to a rooftop waiting lounge which had massage chairs and free coffee while offering a great view of the city. The rooms were large and well maintained while also offering great views. The break fast had a vast spread and it was literally impossible to cover the entire spread.",5

Choose better than Pan-Pacific,JeffFlorida,"I chose this hotel for its location and good value vs similar properties in Singapore.  The hotel and rooms were somewhat dated although tastefully done.  In room ammenities were inconsistent- our mini-bar wasn't fully stocked on day one and never refilled of the items consumed.  In addition, the hair dryer ceased operation in the middle of my wife's preparation (staff did bring a portable within minutes).  After a concert, we were left with no choice (our fault because of the late hour) but to order off the room service menu and consumed it at the atrium bar.  We were made to sign for it at delivery and it was undoubtedly the worst meal I've ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world (burger and chicken sandwich).  I complained twice- including at check out- and basically was‚Ä¶",2

Top notch Hotel,Martin Raf,"I had a stunning Harbor view Clubroom on 32nd floor. Very comfortable bed and great bathroom. The pool and gym was nice but not extraordinarily. The Lounge though was fabulous, the views the canap√©s and staff made sure we had unforgettable moments in the late afternoons. This hotel exceeds our expectations by far and its a fair alternative to its neighbourgh the fantastic Mandarin Oriental.",5
"Great service, support and food.",Gianni N,"This hotel clearly prides itself on being unobtrusively helpful; some water bottles left for the customers enjoyment, a little birthday cake for my wife. These things were nice little surprises that enhanced an already great stay. the pool staff were very friendly and willing to help. The breakfast bar is a gourmands dream with what seemed 40 metres of options overwhelming the senses, but all good quality. Knowledgeable staff assisted whenever they could and we were treated extremely well always.",5
Great Modern Hotel.,GlobetrottingGran56,"This was a great hotel.  Spectacular reception area with the open atrium up to the top of the hotel.  Very well placed for walking to Marina Bay, Raffles etc.  We enjoyed a lovely room with balcony overlooking the Marina Bay and Marina Bay Hotel with the sea beyond.  The bathroom was especially well appointed.  The pool area is also very relaxing and the pool nice for a cooling dip.  There is a good choice of restaurants and bars.  Highly recommended and would definitely stay there again if we return to Singapore.",5

Good Business hotel,Miranda,This hotel is only one subway stop from Marina Bay Sands.  It is a big hotel with big rooms.  The amenities is fine as it links to several local shopping malls.  The only problem with this hotel is the elevators..they are so slow...it drove one crazy if you are under time pressure.  The pillows are way too soft and has no neck support.  ,4
Wow,Melanie T,This was our 1st time in Singapore and we chose to stay at The Pan Pacific Marina Square... Wow wow wow this hotel was sensational the staff were amazing and facilities were 1st class..

The staff in all areas were of high standard and we experienced excellent service and friendliness. I would like to pass on my thanks to the staff in Pacific Club room whom were very friendly. I would like to see some more western nibbles there occasionally but really it was an outstanding experience. We walked to most tourists areas but also took taxis when it was just too far away. Watch out for the $5 added fee every so often that the taxis add on. Not sure if they added them on too often during the day time. But really, it is a cheap way‚Ä¶",5

Poor services at Pan Pacific,anonR2984VO,1. busy and old room layouts - ambiance is not motivating 2. mistakes in booking - the staff made mistake in booking and argued to charge for 1 extra night 3. loess vegeterian options on in-room dining menu - portions are small - delivery took more than 45 mins,1
Three Day Stay,Doug S,Checked in after a long flight from the UK the hotel is on a busy road but you wouldn‚Äôt know it in your spacious room.   We were in the 25th floor with a fantastic view over the Marina. Easy walking distance to the underground and the Marina it‚Äôs self.   The breakfast was amazing we have never seen so much choice with a huge choice from all kinds of cultures it was good to try different food for breakfast.   The huge atrium gives this hotel a stunning interior.   If I come back I will be staying here again  ,5

Breathtaking luxury hotel in perfect location,Isabella D,"We treated ourselves to this hotel on a stopover to Indonesia. We were lucky enough to stay for 4 nights over New Year so there was lots going on in Singapore. The hotel was stunning, we couldn't believe we had booked this place. The room was huge, the bed was so comfy - just what we needed after our flight. We booked an extra day to ensure that we could check in early after landing at 0700, we didn't want to wait for the standard check in time in the afternoon. It's quite likely the room would have been available early but I didn't want to risk it. The staff were super friendly and couldn't do enough for us. The pool area was a hidden gem out of the bustle of the city. The highlight was the breakfast!!! Biggest selection I have ever experience in a hotel, choose a breakfast‚Ä¶",5
Better than expected,juls335,"I wasn't expecting that much since I know for a fact they they're not really known as a kid-friendly hotel but our stay with our 2 year old here was surprisingly good.  The facilities were quite nice and again, this is not a family-friendly hotel (bathroom has no door of its own-just a sort of sliding door that is also meant to cover the closet, there's a glass table in the room, sockets can be easily reached by toddlers) but overall, it was an enjoyable stay.  The main reason why we booked this is how accessible it is to everything - malls, restaurants, indoor playgrounds, mrt, even tourist destination. And we can see the Singapore flyer from the buffet area! And buffet was more than adequate, we just love it.  Staff was quite nice and friendly too, they kept smiling and saying‚Ä¶",5
Excellent location,christinechin25,"We stayed here over the weekend. Very central, took us about 30 minutes to get to the hotel from Seletar Airport by taxi. The hotel is right next to Suntec shopping centre and the nearest MRT station is Promenade. Check-in was quite fast. We had booked a deluxe room with balcony. Upon check-in we were told that the room that they had reserved for us does not have a balcony, and if we are okay with this, then as compensation, they will give us two complimentary buffet breakfast, which was a very nice gesture. We opted for the buffet breakfast. Room was spacious, everything is as you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom had separate shower and toilet, with the washing sink in between. There was the expected hairdryer, bathrobe, slippers, safe, fridge,‚Ä¶",5

Back for staycation and run,Keith,"Been to this hotel a few times for staycation. Back this time because of the standard chartered marathon . Opted for the club floor room this time. Previous stays has all been very good. This time round probably because it‚Äôs holiday season, but the lounge is extremely slow in serving food or drinks in the morning during breakfast . I ordered an apple juice which never came after an hour until I reminded . I heard the service staff told other guests eggs will take 10mins or so . So I would suggest anyone using the lounge can have breakfast at the Edge, which has a very good spread, then come back up for a drink in the lounge later in the day . I also noticed the club floor check in room seems to have nobody attending to it, not sure if it‚Äôs still in use. The check in service‚Ä¶",5

Disappointing,Andy S,"Having recently stay at the Pan Pacific we were very disappointed with the hotel.   There was no warm welcome on arrival, reception were not very welcoming and the room was just another hotel room. But knowing it was our 40th wedding anniversary the bed had some petals, small cakes and a card, which was very nice, but seemed like an afterthought, when they were informed months ahead. It gave us the impression of a business hotel for individuals who just wanted a good, clean room for the night.  The breakfast was good and location is very good.   But for couples wanting something a little special I would not recommend.  Very much a run of the mill business hotel with no personality  or warmth to guests.",3
Enjoyable staycation,John S,"It was a lovely stay that exceeded our expectations. Our Pacific Harbour Room had glorious view of the Singapore's skyline, and provided an excellent vantage point to gaze at iconic sights like the MBS, Gardens by the Bay and the Floating Platform. This stunning visual was amplified when we acessed The Pacific Club. On its 38th floor, we were greeted with a 360¬∞, panoramic view of the entire CBD area. Clear fluffy clouds in the azure sky overseeing the turquoise sea, with the various engineering marvels like the MBS surrounding the bay. This picturesque view was a sight to behold. To top it all, the service attitude of the staffs in the hotel was earnestly helpful, and immensely polite, tinged with genuine warmth. Without any doubt, this staycation is one of the most memorable‚Ä¶",5

Excellent,john h,"Modern, spotlessly clean and comfortable - all at a reasonable price.  The staff were attentive and excelent at their role.  The prices in the Atrium bar - be aware they do not include GST and service.  Breakfast was seriously impressive - huge choice of well cooked / presented meals.  EXCEPT - the qualifty of the coffee and tea served are poor.  It would be better to install the european style 'self serve machines' which do produces excellent hot drinks.  The room was all one could hope for, spacious and comfortable, great bath and shower room.  Impressive views over the harbour.  Apart from the breakfast hot drink, everything was very good.",5
Perfect Hotel in Singapore,LisaW781792,Great location downtown near the bay and also near an MRT station.  Amazing breakfast buffet included with room rate.  Reasonable price for a comfortable room with a great view.  Friendly staff.  We would definitely stay here again.,5
Business hotel,john_northbay,"We stayed here pre cruise, and it was nice and close to the port, as well as some beautiful city scenery a short walk away in the marina area. The hotel has a definite business feel, and the elevators and front desk were often crowded and slow. We arrived from west coast US at 5 am and though it was no surprise that our room wasn‚Äôt available, at least they did check. We had slept on the plane, so went out for a morning walk,  but if I hadn‚Äôt had the benefit of business class on the plane, I think I would recommend booking an extra night pre stay at the hotel, as the lounge they direct you to wait for your room, isn‚Äôt much, and I couldn‚Äôt see waiting several hours there for a 3pm check in. The room itself was nice enough, with a decent view. The breakfast buffet is large and‚Ä¶",4
Excellent,swatts67,A lovely hotel with excellent staff. Kumar the housekeeper was helpful the chambermaid was very kind and my room was spotless. The atrium staff were friendly and  the Chinese restaurant and Indian restaurants were excellent. Breakfast buffet had a variety of international food I'd never seen before. I'd highly recommend staying here and would come back and use this hotel chain again.,5
Recommend you stay at Pan Pacific,chris&rondelle,"Good location; lovely service; comfortable bed and nice bathroom; excellent breakfast. I would stay here again, it is walking distance to most things I wanted to visit (like the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and Raffles, so very convenient location. ",5
Quality stay (as expected),Troy M,"A quality hotel in a busy modern city translates into lots of people enjoying the services.    Often this ends up making the clients feel a bit rushed or not important.  The Pan Pacific staff did a great job of making sure that we still felt like valued customers even though there were always 10 people behind us in line waiting their turn.  Well done.    Location = great, two MRT stops within walking distance although you really could just live in the hotel without ever leaving. Amenities = great.  Its one of the Pan Pacific line.  So quality is part of the package. Staff = great international mix of staff keep the place humming along. Food = overall pretty good.  Although this is Singapore.  So good food is always just around the corner.",5
Pan Pacific Singapore,Jan B,"The hotel itself is very nice; the staff are great ... friendly and helpful. There are various options for eating. But, probably the best thing about the hotel is its location: right at the doorstep to the marina and attached to a mall (although there are many malls in Singapore).  We like to take the Hop-on-and-Off when we go to a new city to orient ourselves with the place and the starting point for these buses was (almost) attached to the hotel, i.e. the other side of the mall. Although our room was listed as ""Deluxe"" it wasn't large for a hotel room. This is probably due to the value of space in Singapore. But, it was reasonably equipped.  Given the location,  we felt the price was what we expected to pay.",4
Pan Pacific Terrific,Ian B,One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. The breakfast is an absolute feast!!  The Concierge was a great help and the staff are very helpful. The pool area was creme de la creme. The room and views were superlative. ,5
Beautiful guest rooms,Weeotta,"Our stay was excellent.  The room was clean and comfortable.  We stayed on the 35th floor which gave us a beautiful view of the Singapore Flyer, Gardens By the Bay, and Marina Bay Sands.  We chose the meal package that entitled us to the top floor for breakfast, high tea, and appetizers with cocktails in the evening.  Well worth the upgrade. The pool area was large with a good seating area.  Two shopping malls are attached to the property.  The Hop On Hop Off buses were conveniently located.  We would highly recommend Pan Pacific Singapore.  ",5
Superb quality at great  price//performance,Mach,"When arrived the room key didn¬¥t work and I had to return 2 times to the reception without success..... Not a good start, however, as an apology, we got a room upgrade for 2 levels up even without asking for it and since that time I would rate Pan Pacific a clear 5. All was absolute top - service quality, extremely helpful staff, superb breakfast and the Hospitality option when leaving was GREAT.  I was at Four Seasons, at W and all regular stuff like Hiltons, Sheratons etc and have to say Pan Pacific is a great choice.",5
Perfect Stop-Over Stay,mhoffmann2019,"This hotel is perfect for a stop-over stay. We had 2 days and nearly everything was excellent. The location for sightseeing is optimal, the service and staff are really very good.  I can only recommend this hotel.",5
Stayed Here For a 5 star room,Beant Grewal,"I would not give this hotel 5 stars. We booked a deluxe room with balcony which we were given. Came around 1pm to check in which was too early which we knew so returned at 3pm. Only then we had to wait again as no room was ready. Once we were given the room key around 3.20 room was dusty dirty around edges and to sides of bed. Walls were filthy and lights witches. Definitely not a 5 star.  We complained were shown another room which we declined as had no view of marina. We were then given another room which we had no choice but too take as was a non refundable booking. We wasted from 3.20 to 5.40pm trying to get a decent room. Was given a free breakfast for one night as I asked for some goodwill otherwise wasn't offered anything. Manager Sam and Nicolas we're still good to us,‚Ä¶",3
A very good ambience,Natalia M,"A good location for stay when on business trip around Marina area. At night, you can still walk around the Marina Square and find foods and shopping. Breakfast was excellent with lots of variety. Will recommend this hotel.",4
Great service and location,Ezra C,"Pan Pacific offers almost everything one would want in a hotel - location is within walking distance of many attractions, several excellent restaurants, exceptional breakfast buffet [one of the best I have ever had], great fitness center, wonderful staff and service, spacious rooms. The hotel itself is attractive and modern with an expansive lobby. Rooms are comfortable with the only issue being the air conditioning blows directly onto the work desk making it difficult to stay cool and do work at the same time. All in all, a great hotel.",4
Good for business trip,Ange516,"I stayed here for 5 nights while we were hosting a conference at the hotel. I found the hotel lacking a bit in character but I'm usually not a fan of these kinds of big hotels anyway. It was definitely super as a conference location and the staff is very professional, friendly and helpful. The food was amazing as well and the breakfast had loads of choices, all delicious. If you need anything printed though, the cost is prohibitive, and the a/c is so cold, we all got sick while we were there. Also in the room I kept shutting off the a/c because it was freezing and every time I entered it was on again. The blowdryer was the most annoying feature - it went off after one minute every time and then needed 5-10 minutes to cool down. When ordering room service, it took until later in‚Ä¶",4
Highly recommend the Club floor if you want to splash out!,shelley9London,"Fantastic Club room!   Great breakfast, afternoon tea and happy hour in Pacific Club 38th floor . Great location with very friendly and efficient staff.  I arrived early and was allowed an early check in.  Pool looked nice but too busy sightseeing to use it.  Loved my break in Pan Pacific and adored Singapore!",5
Superb hotel in an excellent location,St.AlbansHerts.,"We couldn't have chosen a better place to stay for our first visit to Singapore. The whole experience was amazing! We loved the swimming pool and the hotel atrium is stunning, particularly when viewed from the lifts. Breakfast in the Edge was excellent - there was so much choice! Pan Pacific is in an excellent location and in easy walking distance of Marina Bay.and Raffles hotel as well as being close to Promenade metro station. If we are lucky enough to return to Singapore in the future, we would definitely choose the Pan Pacific. ",5

Wow the Club Floor for food drinks and services is the best,tonygillian,"Just return from six nights at the Pan Pacific staying on the Club floor level 34. Have  not commented since our last review in in 2016 but have stayed five times in the past three years. Well what can you say about this hotel, service food and drinks  that has not been said before.  My wife and I arrived early and our room was ready for us over looking Marina Bay, what a view. The room was very clean and fresh with a welcoming letter with fruit and a box of  chocolate. We had breakfast at the Edge restaurant, well the food to die for from all parts of the world.With refreshing fruit juices, coffees and tea. Must mention Janice and Jega who greet you like part of there family. The Club floor for drinks and great food is the best, with flowing champagne, cocktails and beer and‚Ä¶",5
Comfortable and very clean of course,Mike M,"Having visited Singapore several times, we shall select Pan Pacific in the future. I'ts close to the Marina and has everything we needed. The room was really a Suite - and served us well. Staff were extreamly friendly and helpful.",5
Kindness and good service,hyuckkim,"Three nights in Singapore were fantastic. First of all, the hotel location is good. Marina Bay Sands and Mulrien are close, and the movement can travel coolly underground through Marina Square. The advantage of a club room is that you can have a good time with a good view of the top floor. Marina Bay Sands is to recommend sending a good time. Rooms upgrade rooms with Marina Bay Sands or recommend swimming pool views.",5

Exquisite Hotel,olunissi,Ambience is to die for. Staff very helpful and friendly. Food was great. Lounge to stay in before return flight was such a big help. Great customer service. Housekeeper was too pushy to clean the room though even with me in it. It became annoying and intrusive. ,5
Perfect Birthday Dinner Celebration,CarlaDG,Celebrated my Birthday at Pan Pacific Edge and the experience was superb! The food selection is great and taste good. Good value for money! Also would like to compliment Mr Muru for the splendid and spot-on dining service. He was really helpful and serves with a great smile. He make sure everything was well taken care of. We will truly come back for more dining experience!!!,5
Amazing Hotel. Amazing Location,SoloNightingale,"A friend of mine recommended me to Pan Pacific. He'd stayed there 3 times in his 5 trips to Singapore. I definitely see why it's his favourite. It's now mine too. It's nice and quiet, stylish and not too pricey. You'll always find a cheaper hotel but this is located brilliantly for people who want to get into the heart of Singapore without taking too many modes of transport. MRT (their underground) is so cheap anyway and easy to navigate. I had a Panoramic View room, it wasn't an amazing view and you'd probably get the same nice feeling from a downgrade. I have nothing to fault on this room. They do hold a ¬£300 deposit on your card prior to your stay which I wasn't warned about. But it was fine.",5
"Great room, even greater food",McLarenSenna,"Our stay here turned into a gastronomic experience when we discovered that it was renowned for its buffet and Indian restaurant. The room had everything we could ask for but it was the buffet that blew our minds, because it has more than we could ever imagine. The spread was so vast and laid out in such an appetizing manner, it was one of my most memorable dining experiences. We had made reservations and they has our names written in chocolate on tiny plates and we thought it was really cute. The cuisine ranged from western, Indian, Chinese, Japanese to local delights and others, and they were all amazing!",4
"Fantastic hotel, didn‚Äôt want to leave",nottsgirl487,"My friend and I have just stayed for four nights in this wonderful hotel.  There was absolutely nothing to fault.  The location was perfect - two MRT stations within a short walking distance, and easily walkable (over Helix bridge) to Gardens by the Bay and the mall adjacent to the famous hotel (which we were so pleased we didn‚Äôt stay at, having walked through the ground floor areas).  Our room was on 24th floor with city views which was fine.  We had chosen to upgrade to the Club facilities which was excellent value.  I can honestly say, it was the best I had encountered (including several hotels in Dubai).  The choice of drinks (including a certain branded rose champagne) and food was excellent, together with the fantastic view from the 38th floor.   We ate breakfast in the‚Ä¶",5
Fantastic in every way,TraceyBalboa,"I really can't say enough about this fantastic hotel.

The conceige Deejay was so helpful & cheerful everyday  & Fahmi in the Club Lounge was so friendly & made us feel so welcome as did the rest of the staff. You definitely get the wow factor from when you first walk through the doors of this hotel. Standards of food were amazing & I can't really fault a thing. I will certainly be returning & wouldn't hesitate to recommend this fabulous place",5
Welcoming,Debra,"Pan Pacific rooms 2815, 921 & 2821 all rooms fantastic suites very spacious and all rooms very clean.

Great location,fredleckie,"Stayed here for 2 nights for stopover on way to Thailand,   The hotel has a great location, easy walk to raffles, marina bay sands and esplanade.  We stayed in a club room which is well worth the extra as u get use of club lounge with spectacular 360¬∞ views of Singapore all day and 2 hours drinks and snacks in evening.   Breakfast is good with a great variety of food, only complaint was that some things weren't hot enough, but enjoyed what was on offer..    Reception area is very nice and the bar there is pretty good to,    Staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable on what's on offer at hotel and tourist information.    We enjoyed our stay here and would use it again if ever back in Singapore which we probably will do as it is a great city to visit",5
nice modern room,AlvinHotelguru,"It is my 2nd visit to this hotel as my company was hosting annual dinner in hotel nearby. I picked Pan Pacific because rate was cheaper than other neigbouring 5 star hotels. (less than S$400 for room and breakfast at Edge.) Check in was effortless and fast because I checked in at exclusive counter meant for Discovery club members. I went to the assigned room at 19th floor. I was impressed by this modern room.  There is no need to put card into slot just to power the room. I am happy that with the convenience because when you opened the door to enter the room, motion sensor will detect human movement and automatically switch on the room brightly for you.  I went to gym and then to swim. I am impressed with overall facilities there .  Night time, went to bed, just pressed "" Master‚Ä¶",5
Wonderful stay in a convenient location ,MVTravels," This hotel was immaculate! Every employee went above and beyond to assist you, the room was upscale with a beautiful view and the lobby was even more beautiful than the pictures can depict.  It was a quick walk to the Merlion statue and all of the restaurants along the bay. Gardens by the Bay is only a quick 15 minute (with some traffic) taxi ride away. The staff in the front can help you call a taxi at any time of the day; we had a very early flight and they hailed one at 4am for us with a smile!   If you want to grab dinner without crossing the streets, you can access a row of restaurants by walking through a pedestrian area off of the 2nd floor of the hotel.  We‚Äôd definitely stay here again! ",5

Fan of the Pan,Paul S,"Despite a busy week in Singapore due to the FinTech Festival, managed to get a room at the Pan Pacific which I have not stayed in for many years - and what a pleasant surprise! Compared with my usual hotel, I found my stay refreshing, convenient and above all - the feeling of space; every aspect had plenty of room whether in the lobby, bar, room or pool area. Lots of space to have casual meetings/drinks/food with friends or colleagues and the Edge for breakfast was a great experience. It had a really good vibe in the communal areas and the hotel is well connected to the surrounding area by the useful walkways.

Our flight in from Japan arrived in the morning and we got to the hotel around 10AM. Nico was such a delight to deal with as he not only let us check in well before the standard check in time (thank God, because we were so tired after our prior travels and flight), but he also provided us with a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 31st floor with a spectacular view of the Marina Bay! And the compliments did not end there; on the second day of our stay, after we had left our room for the day, we came back to a lovely cakes/sweets dessert platter as a gift for our anniversary.

The rooms were clean and extremely comfortable. We were spoiled for choice at the buffet breakfast and although we didn't eat there in the evening, were assured the food was 5 star quality.",5

I did on my most recent visit and it did not fail my expectations.

Pan Pacific is close to Marina Bay, MRT, buses and taxi's. The Singapore Flyer (Ferris Wheel) is five minutes walk away too. Pan Pacific has a fully equipped supervised gym as well.

Extraordinary Service ,Yusuf Zubayer,"I always value when I get out of the way services. A hotel like Pan Pacific will be a lovely place to stay in is the norm, not the exception. They have everything that a hotel of this stature should have. Room was spacious and squeaky clean. Bathroom was large. Food was delicious. Breakfast buffet had a lot of choices.   However, it‚Äôs how they dealt with my specific need is what made them extraordinary. I called and asked for a prayer mat. The lady told me she‚Äôs sending one over right away. Then the house keeping guy knocks at my door and hands over to me a prayer mat, a copy of the Quran and a compass so that I know which is the direction of Makkah. That was just Wow!!

The pleasant scent entering the room after a long day made it truly feel first class. Would stay again without hesitation.,5

Pacific Club is the Best Lounge Ever!,Raymond Wee,"My staycation at Pan Pacific Singapore's Pacific Harbour Studio was the best stay I had in any hotel. From the room to the lounge to breakfast, everything exceeded my expectations. The bottom line was that although the hotel's a little more pricey, it was completely worthed it!  My Pacific Harbour Studio that faced the habour (hence the name) was huge at 65sqm so both the walk-in wardrobe and bathroom were superscale compared to those from usual 5-star hotel rooms. There was also a really big tub in the middle of the bathroom that I was sure could easily accommodate more than 1 person. I really like the amenities provided (from The White Company's Flowers Collection) that further heighten the sense of luxury.  The room was very well-appointed and tastefully decorated and‚Ä¶",5

Excellent hotel in great location,TreeandTell,"We are lucky enough to have stayed in the Pan Pacific three times now. This is a great hotel. You feel special from the moment you arrive to the minute you leave. The staff are what makes this hotel so special. The concierge, the breakfast team, check in everyone cannot do enough for you. It is worth paying a little extra for a harbour view studio. The views are spectacular especially at night. We had breakfast and again first class, so much variety. I tried to have something different every day and we were there a week.Location is spot on. Just a short (air con) walk through a mall and out onto the Esplanade and bay.

At the other end you can directly walk across to Esplanade where they had music/bands in the evening. Promenade MRT station is only 5 minutes walk. Breakfast was good although a bit crowded.

Room service impeccable, staff so friendly and helpful - no issue about extending checkout to 2pm and storing luggage longer.  Breakfast a truly international cuisine.  I played safe with cooked-to-order eggs and omelettes - multiple chefs so very little waiting even when the restaurant was busy.  And I dined in the Rang Mahal one night - a great Indian menu with some great choices.  I only wish they had slightly quicker elevators (could be a lot of hanging around in the morning) but this didn't detract - this is a great hotel.",5

Such a relaxing lounge to see the beautiful views as the sun is setting each day and the buildings lighting up for the evening.  Breakfast at Edge provides plenty of options.

5 days visit for a quick getaway with golf,Dion,"We visited the Pan PAcific for the first time. It‚Äôs situated right opposite the marina and has fantastic views of the  Ferris wheel and the new Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Some people say best to view the Marina Bay sands from a distance, rather than stay there. I think it was good advice, with spectacular light shows, spend the extra dollars and get the Marina views. The Pan PAcific is 5+ stars. We had a room with Club access. The treats were fantastic and the drinks were a welcome treat after a day tracking through the sites of Singapore. The staff were absolutley brilliant. The rooms were spacious and the service excellent. The Bell guy  looked like he‚Äôd been there for a hundred years and ran the the entrance area like a well oiled machine. You needed a ride, he took care of it.‚Ä¶",5

We declined however requested the Nespresso machine. Was advised we need to pay an additional $50pn for larger room which included machine. We declined again. Next morning we went downstairs at the cafe wand ordered 2 coffees that cost about $11... which was reasonable. Next morning they charged $25 because we sat there.

We had a nice room, and as my husband's birthday happened during our stay, we found a supersize slice/small cake wishing him a happy birthday!  We enjoyed the pool and poolside area, and also spent some time in the pods in hotel reception/bar. Fabulous!",5
Pacific Club Lounge,cedco,"Pacific Club Lounge on 38th floor well worth the room upgrade! Afternoon tea superb, Complimentary drinks 6 to 8 pm come with wide range of food dishes. Great views and excellent service.  Staff very attentive and welcoming throughout hotel. Will be my Number 1 choice next time in Singapore!",5
Good hotel but expensive,wenche71,"Hotel is very nice but a tad expensive. We had 2 club rooms and I don't think the extra cost was worth it. The lounge (38 floor) itself is beautiful and the views are amazing, but the food on offer was not very impressive. I was expecting a lot more for that price. ",4
Excellent Stay and Location,save3900,"One of the best stay that we ever had at a hotel. Super friendly staff and courteous service. When I was checking-out the staff reminded me about the passport  and I thought it was exceptional that they care. Breakfast was awesome. Also from the balcony, I had a nice view of the Marina bay sands. Promenade MRT is in walking distance, also the Esplanade MRT. ",5
Old hotel but very good location and friendly and professional staffs,Yongduk C,"It is located in the center of the city.  My expectation level was not that high as it is not global brand and a bit old.  But it was far way better than my expection level.  Staffs and facilities are very nice and well maintained.  I stayed on 6th floor though, as the room has a balcony, I could enjoy excellent city view.",4
Excellent,CBE,"This is a true 5 star hotel. My room was extremely comfortable and quiet, the bed was awesomely comfortable. The breakfast is one of the best hotel breakfasts I have ever had. There is a wide variety of excellent food, esp the Bircher muesli, and every culture is catered for. The hotel is within walking distance Marina Bay precinct and has very easy access to the Suntec city convention centre.",5
One of the best stays i ever had!!,Sharad_Goyal35000,"If one wants luxury, relaxation, rejuvenation, CHOOSE PAN PACIFIC!!!

Recent business trip,PaulH2307,"Very good, I enjoy my time at this Hotel due to the location next to Suntec. I have been coming here for 25 years.

Stolen items from beauty case,Mrs U Bello,"Having stayed at this hotel before, before i could say anything to my husband he had booked the Pan pacific Singapore.   I must tell you that I have stayed in many hotels In Singapore, but by far this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in my life time stayed in.   First and foremost, the chefs are absolutely terrible and deliberately go into ‚Äúwe can only offer what you see‚Äù the hotel is so busy making food for room service guests that I guess their priority is serving customers ordering food.  They had 3 pasta‚Äôs on display, when I asked for the pasta that they were displaying they advised me they could not offer it because it was just for display. This went on day after day, when I asked for pasta for my son.  When I asked the chefs at the food station if I could have pasta‚Ä¶",1
Good service,163tracyj,"Great location and very good service. I love the TV Channel with cartoons which kept my child entertained while I take care of my business.

An oasis in the city,Sven-Oliver J,"My review might be tainted, as we had a horror trip before. But the Pan delivered the necessary relief we needed.  Super friendly staff was accomodating all the needs we had. The whole hotel is very stylish and well maintained. Our room was perfect with view on the harbour.  The breakfast had everything we needed with an unbelievable choice!  So, whenever in Singapore, I would come again without any doubts!",5

In addition, a big thanks to the lovely Sam (concierge staff).  We very much look forward to our next stay.",5
Great location,Linda H,Great location friendly efficient staff. International  breakfast with plenty of choice and good quality. Many guests were on business trips and the rooms are geared to this client group. I didn't really want a huge desk in the room when I'm on holiday. Really nice pool area good to relax and cool down. The lobby bar had a lovely atmosphere and amazing cocktails. ,4
Singapore,Scenic672503,Disappointing experience at this hotel in comparison to an incredible one at Hyatt Saigon. Possibly an unfair comparison. Rooms were comfortable and is in a great central location. Bed a little firm for our liking.,3
"Thoughtful service, great room comfort!",Cathy Yuna C,"This hotel is beautiful and well maintained, room was very clean and comfortable. Generally preferred the high floors, glad that this is a tall building and could see a nice view of the city. I liked how the lifts transparent and outward facing, got to see the surroundings while heading up to my room!  Located at an ideal location! Close proximity to shopping malls nearby, about 2-3mins walk to malls like Millenia Walk and Marina Square. Promenade MRT station is about 5 mins walk away, bus services nearby too. Walkable distance to the Singapore iconic Marina Bay Sands via the Helix bridge, take about 15mins! No lack of taxi services especially on checking out if you‚Äôre headed for the airport.

Splendid views!,MyMatahari,"Overall experience was good but the breakfast buffet could be improved. Firstly it is overpriced for the quality that was served. The room was comfortable, and during my stay, I had a room with a view of Marina Bay Sands and the surrounding areas. That was a real bonus coming back after a long day. Thank you! I simply loved having the Nespresso coffee machine in the room. The location of this hotel is also really good. Close to shopping areas, though I did not have enough time to explore those on this trip. ",4
Fantastic balcony room with view,SAMie,"Perfect location, esp for a 1st trip to SG. Deluxe balcony room looking out at Marina Bay. View of Marina Bay Sands, The Flyer, etc. Could even watch the light show from the nice sized balcony. Easy access to many malls and food spots nearby, metro 3 min walk, 15 min walk to MBS.  Comfy room, good amenities...gym, pool, restaurants. Concierge was quite helpful.  Only negative was some issues with wifi. Spotty in parts of the hotel and then didn't work at all the last night (IT tried to help but we gave up).  Highly recommended!",5
Fantastic!,Getaway299551,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights during the F1. From start to finish the hotel was fantastic. Staff extremely friendly. Our room was spotless, comfortable bed, all things needed in the room. Our tv remote batteries were dead and the aircon stopped working but these were resolved super fast so we were really extremely impressed on how on the ball they are. Little extras provided during the F1 so it was nice to get little surprises each day left in our room. Location is fantastic, steps to the metro and our room overlooked the track so we could see all the action. One of the best stays I have had in a hotel around the world, thanks to how things were run and how clean the place was! Thank you.",5

Service standard plummets,adamliewwl,"I have stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel a couple of times, and wrote a raving review which can be found here: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d302294-r445764729-Pan_Pacific_Singapore-Singapore.html  Unfortunately, my recent two stays with the hotel have confirmed that service standards have plummeted to abysmal levels, and I think it is high time for management to consider improving certain areas.   My two stays with the Pan Pacific Hotel happened on two occasions - 7 - 8 September 2019 and 28 - 29 September 2019. I am a huge fan of the hotel's refurbished Pan Pacific Harbour Studios and was informed by several of their staff during my previous stays that I can make a written request for those rooms in advance.

The best club lounge I have experienced ,Mei81,"Stayed in a Harbour Studio room with a great view of the marina Bay Area.   Highlight of the stay is the access to the Pacific Club, which I felt was REALLY the best I‚Äôve experienced in terms of the layout, food and service.   Layout  - you step out directly to the pacific club and it seems so intimate and exclusive at the same time. It‚Äôs built to offer wraparound marina views from anywhere in the club which is splendid!   Food - the food offerings are also one of the best I‚Äôve had . The afternoon tea had savory and sweets. I loved how the scones were so buttery and soft. Afternoon tea was quite a spread with fried prawn dumplings, steamed dishes, sweets, salads and cold cuts.  Evening cocktail was fantastic , with pork trotters in vinegar , beef stew, sea bass , salads ,‚Ä¶",5

The lovely staff found a room for us immediately. From then on the service was impeccable. We had a harbourfront room which overlooked the race track.

Long Weekend Staycation,Taj Imran,"Stayed here over the long CNY weekend. We took the harbour/bay view suite which was really spacious. Separate living area with a 6 seater dining table, and a large bedroom with a walk in wardrobe and possibly, one of the biggest bathrooms I have ever seen. The view from the suite was nice, and we got to see the CNY fireworks over the weekend as well. Location of the hotel is good, as one can access shopping malls within walking distance. The service quality of the staff is also excellent. Our requests were followed up very quickly. And housekeeping was efficient. The suite was always cleaned very well and pleasant to come back to. Great place to stay.",4
Very good but on the expensive side,extriathlete,"Decorated ready for the F1 grand prix and right next to the track, so if you don't like fast cars and the associated noise, don't stay here then. Very smart hotel, quite literally two tiers. Up to floor 22 and floor 23 upwards. We were on 16 on the opposite side of the building to the lifts. Fabulous views at night, not too good during the day because of the burnt rainforest smog, sadly. Food is very good but expensive. The evening buffet is a legend.",4
Great location,Warren,"Well located Hotel within easy walking distance to the Marina Bay harbour. Hotel is part of the Marina Square shopping centre which through the One Raffles Link connects with the City Link Mall and enables patrons to walk practically underground all the way to the City Hall MRT station and stay out of the Singapore heat & haze. City Hall MRT station enables you to get to Orchard Road shopping via rail. The pool area is a great place to rest at the end of the day, with plenty of seating around the pool. Stayed in a Harbour View Studio on the 32nd level which was a beautifully appointed room, spacious in size, had a great bath and views of the Marina Bay harbour.

"Superb service, wonderful views",Suarez07,"We chose Pan Pacific due to having stayed at two great properties in Malaysia, both sadly no longer managed by them, and we were not disappointed in any respect.  The levels of cleanliness, service and maintenance are far in excess of what you get from the American and European chains, on a par with Shangri La group.   We paid extra to get a high level harbour view room with Pacific club access, and it was well worth it: the food and drink during afternoon tea and cocktail time were excellent, taken in the rooftop club lounge and served by wonderful friendly and helpful staff.  In the evening there is a panoramic view of the nightly light show in the harbour and the bay gardens.

Breakfast was help yourself buffet with a large selection and very tasty. The hotel also hosted a Michelin star indian restaurant and a Japanese restaurant The foyer/ atrium was very welcoming with a bar and another restaurant Staff were very pleasant and helpful.

Access to the beautifully peaceful club lounge, with it's stunning 360 degrees views of Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline is a major plus. Add to that the fabulous complimentary breakfasts, afternoon tea (so much more than scones and cakes!) and evening drinks and canap√©s (the options here can easily replace the need for dinner üòä) and the decision to book a club room is a complete no brainer. Service in the lounge is first class too - it's the whole package!",5
Stop Over Retreat,Timothy R,This was a stop over to break our flight from London to Australia.  I have previously stayed at the Pan Pacific but it was a first for my husband.  This hotel is so centrally located to all the Marina Bay activities and the Raffles Hotel.  From the moment you check in until you leave you are treated to 5 star hospitality.  It is a must to upgrade to the Pacific Club where you enjoy a table service breakfast and endless evening cocktails and French champagne and the best views over Marina Bay to watch the light show of the flower gardens.  The staff were so efficient and professional where all your requests are accommodated.  The rooms are large with all amenities provided.  I highly recommend this hotel on a visit to Singapore. ,5

We called again and this time got what we asked for. 2) At poolside, the waiters served drinks across the face of another customer when they could and should have come round to the person they were serving. 3) At checkout, a staff member went to the people BEHIND me and offered them a faster express checkout, not checking with me first if I didn't want to stand waiting.

Special thanks to Jane, Roy and Se Yeon who served us in the 38th floor restaurant, who made sure our meals and drinks were faultless.",5
Great hotel stay,Lani B,"Staff are absolutely amazing.  And the rooms are very comfortable and clean.  The beds are much firmer than I am use to, but still comfortable.  Breakfast buffet was great!!! So many different foods to choose from and will cater to everyone.  The location is also great, so close to main attractions and shops.  It was a perfect stay for the first part of our honeymoon.  Will definitely stay again and recommend to others.",5
"What a fantastic Hotel!,",C3441YPcolinr,We have stayed in a number of 5 Star Hotels in Singapore but the Pan Pacific exceeded our expectations. From Checkin to Checkout we could not find fault with anything at the Hotel.  The partial Harbour view room with balcony was ideal and the views terrific. The staff were always friendly and helpful and the restaurants within the Hotel were first class in both food and beverage as well as service. We could not recommend the Pan Pacific more highly and will certainly be staying there again on our next trip to Singapore.,5
Wonderful Hotel and Excellent Staff,RickyJ62,"The Pan Pacific is well located with easy access to shopping, restaurants and public transport. The hotel is impressive, very clean and well maintained. Our Balcony room was well sized with comfortable bed, desk/chair, 2 lounge chairs, plus you could sit outside. Loved the choice of shower heads & the bench seat, appreciated the separate toilet. Good quality toiletries replenished daily. There is storage for suitcases and a good size wardrobe. A minor point though - no drawers or clothes line. The pool, although not deep, is large and has plenty of shade and seating. There are a number of restaurants, pool bar and a lobby lounge/bar. We used Edge, Pacific Marketplace, pool bar and the Atrium Lounge on many occasions and were very impressed with all. Room service was good but‚Ä¶",5
Here now and have another 5 days of hard bed and pillows,ozhelen63,"I thought I would come back from the Pan Pacific after last being here 30 years ago.  The staff are absolutely excellent, very attentive and very nice to deal with...The food amazing, but the hotel loses votes from me as my issue are the beds and pillows.  Sleeping is difficult on a very hard bed with pillows that are so high my neck cant deal with them.  I have woken up with stiffness two days running....not the best and I have 5 more days of this.  If you love a hard bed and high pillow then you have found yourself an awesome hotel",3
Excellent stay,grahamdc2019,Loved the hotel and the rooms were amazing. The check in process seems to take a very long time compared to other hotels which can be frustrating if the queue is long. The bars and staff across the hotel were very good.,5
Amazing hotel,Mandy & Gary,"Loved our stay, we got the best views of Marina Bay square  from our balcony. We could watch the daily light shows from our balcony. Room was spacious, modern and cleaned every day. Central location very handy to get around.",5
Great place to stay,amy Lauren,"Stayed for our honeymoon, was a lovely stay. staff were amazing super helpful with suggestions on where to eat! Great location in regards to everything you want to see! Great facilities. Delicious cocktails by the pool!",5
Pan Pacific Singapore Raffles ROCKS!,JJ0616,"If you're going to Singapore, ya gotta stay at Pan Pacific on Raffles Blvd! The hotel is nice, clean, modern, and all around awesome! The staff provides the best customer service, especially Rojie! He makes you feel like a real VIP! And it's in a great location...with three malls literally connected to it, and bus stops right outside the front door for easy access to public transportation (which is clean and cheap). Oh, and the food is fabulous - the strawberry lime tarts will get you addicted!! Going to Singapore - stay here for the best Vaca ever!",5
Lovely hotel close to the centre,David-McNiven,"We had a 3 day stop over on the way to Thailand and stayed in two superior rooms with 2 children on a bed and breakfast basis. The hotel is well appointed with numerous options for eating including a kind of market place within the hotel. We ate in the Atrium restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed the meal with plenty of options for the kids. Expect to pay more than restaurants in wider Singapore however the quality was excellent. Due to tax and importation wine is very expensive in Singapore if you‚Äôre a wine lover.   The options for breakfast were amazing from western to Thai, Indian, Chinese, vegetarian and plenty of others.   The hotel gym is well appointed and sits by the pool which itself has a kind of roof top feel on the 3rd or 4th floor.  The rooms were of a high standard‚Ä¶",5
Love Pan Pac,Kim G,Spacious rooms with good amenities. Close to shopping malls. Easy to get to other places.  Check in was at 3pm which made it a long day for me having to wake up 4am for my flight to SG. Otherwise value for money with good breakfast.,4
Our fifth and final visit here,T D,"This was the fifth time we have stayed at this hotel.  Previously we stayed as a couple in Pacific rooms and it was brilliant. This time, travelling with our two children we found the hotel to be quite a let down.   We had booked a room very clearly stating it was for 4 people (it was a suite with a king bed and a sofa bed). On arrival they wanted almost another ¬£100 for sheets for the sofa bed and made us feel it was our fault for not knowing this. I explained we weren't trying to sneak anyone in, we had a reservation showing four people , and hence a reasonable expectation that this would include bedding for 4 people. After some debate the hotel waived the additional fee but made out that somehow they were doing us a massive favour.   In the room there was only one small‚Ä¶",2
Great Hotel run by Lovely People,Simon & Rebecca,"Stayed here B&B with friends for a 3 night city break on the 18th August on route to Bali. The rooms were very smart, modern and well maintained. We stayed on the 10th floor facing the bay which was a fantastic view. Breakfast was excellent and the choice was amazing. Good location within easy walking distance to the bay and the main city attractions. All of the staff were very friendly and accommodating, we were very happy with our choice and would definitely recommend staying here.",5

We've spent almost the day after at the pool before leaving to the airport, absolutely relax time there. Room clean with every comfort, staff friendly and professional. Such a nice position!!",4
Good not perfect.,keroro7,"Arrived  at quite early morning, and instructed to go to customer lounge for early check-in and got lost about 10 minutes - even though it was my second visit, but couldn't find the lounge - no hotel staff was around to give any guideline. Later I found some of other guests were guided to lounge by the staff, not like me. Am I discriminated or simply lack of staff? I don't' know, but it definitely NOT pleasant.  Overall staffs were quite friendly, and facility was nice, but some of hotel staffs, especially in kitchen area, really need to put on some smile b/c those smiles I paid for it, god's sake.   This hotel was quite convenient w/ bunch of connections to big shopping mall right next to hotel, and many interesting restaurants are around. Very close to Merlion statue, and‚Ä¶",4
Customer service,Singh1234,The hotel is amazing and worth every penny. The staff are lovely and soo welcoming. One mention to Janice who was amazing during breakfast...it was my mum birthday and she specially sang a song brought a cake. The rooms are clean and the view you get is amazing.,5
Perfect location,Jawaher,"Loved the hotel in every way. Perfect location in the center of marina bay and good services throughout our stay.  Only one thing the hotel room was the right size, however it is old and needs an update. ",4
Communication lapses and changes in policy to GHA Black benefits,chan8989,"Just to share a recent disappointing experience at Pan Pacific Singapore for purposes of an anniversary celebration.  As a GHA Black member, while I fully understand that double upgrade and early check-in are subject to availability, I am very disappointed that my multiple emails requesting for early check-in to both the Reservations team and Enquiries team the day before my stay went unanswered. When checking in at the Discovery front desk at 11am on the day of my stay, no apologies were offered for the absence of email replies and the only response we received was that the Reservations team and Enquiries team do not work on Sundays.   We have checked the Discovery app and noted and informed the front desk that we do see a double upgrade being available. However, front desk‚Ä¶",3

It's in a good location close to the Esplanade and Suntec with shopping nearby and two MRT stations for trips further afield.  Staff are great inc. Super friendly Kumar at the bell stand.  The breakfast buffet has a great selection from various cuisines too.,4
Fantastic stay,Judy C,"This was our first stay in the hotel and it was fantastic. Fabulous stay in a Pacific Club room.  The service, view, food and drinks in the Club Terrace were amazing.  The staff professional and friendly.  Location perfect.  Definitely would stay again. ",5
"Good location, nice rooms",cats254,"This is a luxury hotel and incredibly beautiful, but I just feel everything was overpriced.  You know when you are staying in a very nice hotel, you expect to pay top price, but I just felt gouged.  However, the room was delightful, clean, spacious, very comfortable.  Location was great.  Connected to several malls, you hardly had to walk outside.  Malls had good food at very reasonable prices for Singapore.  A huge shout out to the concierge, who was very helpful and had good tips and ideas.  Check in and check out was easy.  Had the breakfast/brunch one time, it was lovely but way expensive compared to what we had experienced.  Still if you have the dollars, go for it.  Do your research.",4
Stop off on way to Bali,jennyclairef,"We (couple and teenage daughter) stayed for 3 nights on our way to Bali. We arrived at breakfast time. As expected our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready but was by 11.30am. We were shown to a comfortable room for tea/coffee while we waited.  Staff were welcoming.  It is a huge hotel. Stunning to look at inside,especially if you stand at the bottom and look up!! Room was nice,very comfortable bed. Was a bit tight for 3 people but we managed for only 3 nights. Bathroom was a decent size and good shower. Fabulous view from the balcony. Breakfast-buffet style,everything you could want (apart from porridge which is my favourite),but certainly wasn‚Äôt a hardship to miss that as there was so much choice and all very tasty. Pool- we didn‚Äôt use but looked very nice  Gym- good gym Location-fantastic‚Ä¶",4
"Great service, friendly honest staff",spt2,"We are very lucky to have the luxury of staying at Pan Pacific Singapore a few times now.  Our most recent visit in July 2019 was the best yet.  I was queuing at the check in desk but was invited over to the check out desk as the staff member was available.  Special shout out to Gerald who helped to upgrade my room in order to secure two rooms on the same floor so that my parents and I can be close together.  It was very much appreciated!  The rooms were well furnished and incredibly clean and the beds were plush and soft. Definitely the best bed ever!

Excellent Customer Service,MrsSeow,"Staff are friendly, and stay is comfortable.  Location is fantastic as it's near shopping malls and the waterfront.  Lovely view if you get to stay in a room overlooking the bayfront.  Good place to stay.",4
Stressful checked in,Jessie L,I‚Äôm a regular customer for about 10 years. Every time when we arrived the room was never ready yet. Either they let you wait for 5 hours or more or upgrade the room for extra $ They should have empathy for customers who fly for more than 12 hours and have the room ready when they arrive so that they can have a good rest and refreshing. This is what we call a relaxing holiday right?!,2
Great hotel,Krzysztof B,"I would like to express my great gratitude to Mr. Shawal (who found my personal belongings) and Mr. Mohd Rahid - employees of Pan Pacific Hotel for help in a crisis situation, who showed great alertness and efficiency in action. Once again, thank you for your help, commitment and professionalism in action. All in all the visit in the hotel was very enjoyable.",5

Great 5 star for families and business,Dean S,"Lots to love about this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the team was with our young children. This was particularly important at breakfast, when loading and unloading from Taxi's. The team at the door were great helping with the pram and remembering the kids names.  The room was fantastic with the cot already setup and a spare bed. The main king size double had ample room for my wife and I (plus baby).  Breakfast was top draw and was ready to go and open at 0600.  The hotel itself is attached to a great shopping mall and is in the heart of Singapore. Would definitely recommend to anyone travelling to Singapore.",5
Excellent Hotel in Singapore!,GlobalTravelJunckie,"I often stay at the Pan Pacific when I travel to Singapore and I‚Äôm always very pleased! The location is excellent and the rooms are beautiful. I especially enjoy the glass shower that allows one to take in the skyline as they bathe. It creates a sense of spaciousness and brings in great light into the bath.  The pool and gym are excellent as well. Many families stay here as well and it creates a warm feeling. The pool is very popular!  I enjoy doing some yoga in some of the private secluded areas they have hidden in the pool area.  The breakfast brunch is first class offering a very broad menu representative of Southeast Asia. If you chose to stay her, you won‚Äôt be disappointed!",5

Fantastic Stay!,Darren H,"We have just returned from an eight night stay at the Pan Pacific Singapore and could not fault our experience.   This was our first visit to Singapore and the hotel is in a fantastic location for easily exploring the city. Less than a 5 min walk from both the Esplanade and Promenade MRT stations.   Upon arrival we were checked in by a very friendly and efficient member of staff. He upgraded our room free of charge to have a balcony with view of Marina Bay Sands.   The room was spacious and beds were extremely comfortable. Shower very hot and powerful. Room cleaned to a good standard each day.

"Excellent hotel, perfect location ",EricWhite74,"We were advised to stay here rather than the jen orchard gateway (which we preferred the look of) and are so glad we took the advice.  Everything about the hotel is excellent - service and staff, presentation, rooms (though starting to age) are well equipped and comfortable.  Good breakfast.  Biggest plus is location - on downtown line was perfect for us, easy access to all the sights we wanted to see (gardens by the bay 1 stop, Arab street 1 stop, little India 3 stops, Newton 4 stops, botanic garden 6 stops, fort canning - for the quays - 5 stops).  Staying in orchard would have been far less convenient for these (and only better for the orchard road shops).

Enjoyable stay,Pauline C,"Stayed in the Pan Pacific for 3 nights during August and had a very enjoyable stay . Room was well equipped and well laid out , nice lobby area which we used one night for food and drinks , service started off very badly in the lobby but they snagged to retrieve the situation . Didn‚Äôt go for breakfast but had some food on the poolside , nachos were a big let down but other food was fine and drinks were reasonable. Hotel location is very good for downtown. Only problem with our stay was the lack of loungers and space poolside . I think I found out why on the final day when the Barman questioned which hotel I was from .

No individual service,CJWand3rs,"This hotel is well known and is in a great location for all marina bay attractions. It offers a pleasant lobby and nice rooms at relatively good value for a 5 star hotel... although maybe that's where the issue lies. The Pan Pacific isn't quite the same as the other 5 star hotels.. as guests are still vastly separated depending on wealth once checked in with the sky bar area only being available to elite guests (or for an additional fee. i think it was $150 extra per person? or similar)  All staff are friendly but follow protocol and have no real problem solving power. I had some issues that where unable to be resolved by any staff on duty.

Third Pan Pac visit. Consistently brilliant!!,Shakesnbake,I‚Äôve been lucky enough to stay at the Pan Pacific Singapore three times in the last 18 months and each time has been amazing!  So amazing in fact that I seem to have forgotten to leave a review!  The hotel is located right on the famous Raffles Boulevard and within a ten minute walk to Marina Bay. In fact you can save yourself from the heat and start your route through the adjoining Marina Square mall.   If you‚Äôve never been to Singapore then you‚Äôll find 99% of people to be really friendly and welcoming. Even more so at the Pan Pac where you‚Äôre greeted at the main entrance  by the friendly door staff.  Going in you‚Äôre met by a huge atrium and the signature lifts and stylish Atrium casual dining/lounging area.  The reception staff are super friendly and helpful and always welcome‚Ä¶,5

The bed was amazing and I definitely did not want to get out of bed when the alarm went off the next morning for our flight.  The room is incredibly well sound-proofed so the sleep quality is very good.  The architecture of this hotel is extraordinary and the atrium has to be one of my favourite atriums of all time.

Family holiday,Simarjeet B,The hotel was at an excellent location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The choices offered for breakfast were so varied and delicious.

The breakfast was to die for with something to cater for all nationalities. I found myself trying things I wouldn‚Äôt normally go for which is great.

The Right Choice!,oboolsen,"A stop over on our holiday brought us to Singapore.  We had only 2 nights as this was our first time in the city and we wanted be in the central.

We arrived quite early from our overnight flight and our room was not ready but were offered an upgrade to a club room that was ready.  Included with the upgrade, this package offered cocktails, high tea and breakfast inclusive.  For the added amount it was well worth it.  Highly recommend this room.  Very spacious and comfortable bed and linens.  The view of Marina Bay made it even more special.  Each evening we could watch the ""light show"" on the bay while enjoying drinks in the roof lounge.

Excellent Club Lounge,Dawn L,"Pan Pacific Hotel is one is those places where I think you have to go for club access if possible.  The rooms are well-appointed. But it's really the club lounge that gives the hotel an edge.   First of all, you get breathtaking 360¬∞ views - excellent for catching Singapore's National Day Parade from a distance. The food quality is above that of many hotel executive lounges in Singapore. The service is better as well.  Room service meals are pretty good too.   Among the several hotel linked to Marina Square Shopping Mall, including Marina Mandarin (less classy feel) and Mandarin Oriental (much more expensive), Pan Pac provides great value for the service you receive.

6 Nights in Singapore. ,johnnoshungry,"LOVED   The location- central to everything including the starting point of the hop on hop off bus & 2 MRT stations. The pool area - more than adequate and all facilities provided including pool side bar service. Just faultless.  The restaurant food - speaks for itself. The reasonably priced room service. Extremely Well Treated at our wedding anniversary dinner by Kwan. Service generally. From check-in to house keeping and everything in between; treated like royalty.  DISLIKED  Restaurant prices particularly alcohol,  bordering on exorbitant. Automatic charging of beverages lifted off sensor of mini bar-unethical. Being told we would be charged S$24 to empty mini bar when we wanted to replace it with our own beverages- That is NOT customer first. We avoided this by ordering an‚Ä¶",4
"Spectacular staff, service & rooms!!! ",Athena L,"The staff here is incredible. Jacqueline from the marketplace went above and beyond with helping us customize our orders to suit our food allergies and restrictions, and I can‚Äôt tell you enough how much we appreciated her help. She is exceptional with customer service skills.  I was also helped out by the concierge (unfortunately I forget to get his name) but he was so kind and personable. He gave me a great laugh, telling some jokes and spent time helping me out with taking public transport.  On top of this, the rooms are so luxurious and the beds are very comfortable. Highly recommend staying here for a full on positive experience!!",5
Top Class Hotel,Mr. Mario C,An excellent Hotel. Great Location The Service is excellent and the Food at the Edge is Top class with and amazing selection. The Room we had was clean and comfortable and with a huge bed. The wireless Internet was easy to connect to and fast. Large TV with Coffee/Tea making provided. ,4
Home away from home,Tania B,"We had 6 nights here and just loved it.   The staff were brilliant, from the housekeepers to the front of line staff, always friendly and willing to help. TJ the concierge had some great tips and advice, thank you, it was much appreciated.  The room was very comfortable and quiet. Watch the mini bar.  We had bought a bottle of wine and was difficult to chill down.   Great location to the MRT and a pleasant walk to Marina Sands.   The variety for breakfast was outstanding and everything you could think of was there, plus more.  Checking out was a breeze.  If coming back to Singapore would love to stay again.",5
Wonderful hotel and fantastic staff,Happiness65041127355,"My Singapore holiday was to celebrate my 50th Birthday. On my birthday, I was surprised at breakfast with a piece of cake and candle on it and came back to hotel from a day out and found in my room another surprise cake, bottle of wine and birthday card signed by the Pan Pacific staff. All the Pan Pacific staff were wonderful, polite and very helpful. The location was excellent, very close to shopping malls, MRT, and restaurants. Food served within the hotel for breakfast, lunch and dinner was fresh and delicious and the view of Marina Bay from my balcony was amazing, especially at night. I had access to the Pacific Club and the benefits you get are worthwhile. I loved everything about my stay in the Pan Pacific, it's been the one of the best hotels I've stayed in. I would‚Ä¶",5

Great location but average on everything else,Aditya Tibrewala,"Stayed here for a week on account of business travel and I honestly felt the hotel could have offered a lot more for the price we paid. Here is an account of everything i liked and disliked:  1. The Room We booked the harbour studio which advertises a really good view of the harbour. I guess since the hotel was made quite a while back there might have been a view but now the only view you get is of other peoples windows inside the opposite condrad hotel  The rooms too have nothing in particular to brag about, yes it is bigger in size compared to singapore standards but in terms of actual facilities and features it is pretty average. In order to give value to a room that lacks certain amenities, they provided lounge access, free laundry and some other discounts  2. Pacific Club‚Ä¶",3
The start of our holiday adventure,Margaret S,"Amazing hotel . Exemplary service, the staff were friendly & helpful which combined with lovely room in a perfect location ,made for an excellent start to our holiday.The food was all of a very high standard with lots of variety.The optional external lift was a bonus .",5
Simply Outstanding in every way,dorla,"Our stay at the Pan Pacific was simply outstanding - we had booked a Club Room and from our arrival to our departure the service was faultless.  We arrived after the Club check in had closed bit were dealt with quickly and comfortably.  Our room had a wonderful view over Marina Bay which we expected.  Oddly the large room only had one chair near the coffee table and we had to rely on the office chair nearby.  The bathroom was very clean but a little old fashioned with brown marble worktops but had a good shower.  As we had a Club room we had access to the Club Lounge and I have to compliment every member of staff from breakfast until the ""happy hour"" - every single member of staff were approchable, friendly and helpful.

We had a small issue which was addressed with absolute professionalism which in turn made our family break there amazing.. The hotel, the staff and culture within the Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore ism second to none - great work team and a big thanks to SEL for taking care of everything!",5
Great breakfasts,retePPeter,"This is a very large hotel near the Singapore Flyer and centrally located to many of the attractions like Marina Sands Hotel, The Gardens by The Bay and 1 building away from the Big Bus (hop on/off) hub. Also several shopping Malls directly accessible from the hotel. The lifts are quite frustrating with multiple stops up and down most of the time. Definately would stay here again.",4
Quality hotel in good location,kellie8,"Enjoyed our stay here.  We wanted somewhere to relax on our way home to Australia after a hectic European holiday.  Rooms were comfortable and quiet.  Pool area was good (although drinks were expensive - as they were in most of Singapore).  Staff were efficient and friendly.  We walked to most areas such as Marina Bay Sands, Gardens By the Bay, etc.  Plenty of shopping centres nearby.  Great breakfast with incredible selection of food.",4
Excellent,marypoppins868,"This was added as an extra stop on my holiday, so glad I did it an amazing hotel. Clean rooms with amazing views although I did originally book a room with a balcony was given a different room with great views and a super bath. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Shamal the lobby ambassador helped me check out quickly when the reception was busy and storage of bags no problem. Thanks this is possibly the best hotel I have stayed at",5
Definitely 5 star !,Chris E,"We had an overnight stay here and could not fault the hotel or the service. Definitely 5 star, with a great location. The added bonus of the hospitality lounge was brilliant, and we were able to access this area before our room was available and after we checked out before we went to the airport. The staff were the most  friendly and helpful that we have ever encountered. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",5
Lovely visit ,ZLKing,We stayed a night at the Pan Pacific on a whim! Wanted to catch the National Day preview and we were not disappointed!   We were on the 25th floor and had a clear view of the Marina Bay.   The room was large and very comfy and the bed was incredibly comfortable...  Definitely worth a visit!,5
Such a Great Place to Stay,TexSteve,Our stay at the Pan Pacific was fantastic.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool area was quiet and relaxing. The room was large with a very comfortable bed and spacious bathroom.   There are many restaurants nearby in the malls next door and the MRT train station is just a 5 minute walk away.,5
Outstanding!,Guy M,"We spent almost a week in Pan Pacific and were thrilled.  The location of the hotel is excellent. The staff, especially at the Pacific Club, was also excellent. There were Win and Roy, who gave us a feeling of home. Also to mention our young concierge, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, who tried to make the impossible possible. This hotel is one of the best we have stayed in. Bravo for this outstanding performance.",5
PAN PACIFIC  Raffles Boulevard  SINGAPORE...........OUTSTANDING,Bourns,"I have experienced 5 star hotels in a number of countries but the PACIFIC CLUB at the Pan Pacific tops them all.

Good locations.. Everything is within reach.. ,Tan Sunetta,Good location.. Spacious.. Everything is within reach.. I stayed room with panoramic view which is city view..

Worn down hotel,chungsari,We are only looking to stay at 5-star hotels with decent swimming pools as a family. Was a bit disappointed with the cleanliness. Seemed to have bugs and was itching all over. The swimming pool was fine and of a decent size. The other 5-star hotels in the area or in other areas would be of better choice.,3
Very central! ,MsFluffyB,"Me and my fiance stayed here for 7 nights. We enjoyed our stay here.  Its clean and its not far from the subway, it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the marina bay.  The breakfast buff√© is really huge, you have so much to choose. From pancakes, waffles, omelett, salad and a variety of asian food etc.  Our room was big and clean, the only negative thing was the minibar. You dont have the possibility to put anything of your own in the fridge because everything in the minibar is connected to a system, for example if you move anything it tells directly that you have taken something and you have to pay for it.  The hotel have restaurants, a mini marketplace, a bar. The service for the taxi is easy, the staff are extremly helpful.  I really recommend this hotel! ",4
Unclean Room,Trudway,"We have recently stayed at this hotel and unfortunately found the room very dirty.  There was dried blood up the wall of the toilet, liquid spilt down a bedside cupboard, dirt caked up on the bathroom floor and rubbish behind the TV cupboard and under the bed.  Reception was informed twice but nothing was done to rectify this.  Some of these were rectified after I spoke to one of the cleaners, but I had to take them into the room and show them what I was talking about.    I sent an email to the general manager including photo‚Äôs but have never had a reply.",3

A disappointing stay,Kate_sg1983,"We booked a room for our friend‚Äôs birthday celebration on 27 July. Official check in time was 3pm, we arrived at the hotel at 3.20pm. We were informed that the room is not available yet, it will only be ready in 45min - 1 hour.  Because of the delay, hotel will waive off the cost of the additional bed and assign us a room at 29th floor.  After waiting at the lobby for an hr, we didn‚Äôt receive any call from hotel. However, some tourists managed to check in and got their keys.  At 4.40pm we decided to check with check -in officer again. He told us, our room at 27th floor is ready. Hearing that, we were very shocked as we were promise a room at 29th floor and that‚Äôs the reason why we were willing to wait for an hour. However after the wait, what was promised was not delivered.‚Ä¶",2
One Amazing Hotel! ,Lesley F,"One of the best stays in my life. The hotel‚Äôs architecture is exceptionally beautiful, the services are all great... from the amazing Japanese restaurant in the premises, to the amazing breakfast which offers any kind of food you can imagine!

Just a Few Negatives,BobSt23,"This is a 5 star hotel situated in the Marina Bay area. The location is excellent, a one minute walk from the MRT station that connects to everywhere. The walk to the Gardens on the Bay is under 15 minutes. There are shopping malls all around and you can basically walk from the hotel to the centre of town without stepping onto the street. You must include the free breakfast option when booking. The breakfast buffet is massive and of superb quality, featuring dishes from around the world, offering an unsurpassed variety.  The hotel staff are extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is triangularly shaped and though we only booked a Deluxe King Room, we did reserve and pay months before our visit. Yet we ended up on the low 8th floor on the side of the triangle with no view. This‚Ä¶",4
The hotel does honor yout privacy,TrailBlazer289606,Dont use the wakeup call. If you will be late answering them by 15 minutes they will break into your room. If you complain they dont hear you. then they force you to priny 200 words in order to advertise it.,2
Unexpected Experience at Pan Pac SG ,Cal_TheHotelLover,"Weird title, I know.   That said, I wasn't expecting these impeccable experiences at Pan Pacific Singapore. Superb and quick check in service to the nicely decorated room.   I choose the Panoramic Room which offers ceiling to floor views of the great Singapore, the room also comes with electronic blinds which comes in super handy. Great space for those who enjoy larger space, room also comes with all amenities you needed - the regular luxury 5* hotels kind of amenities if you know what I meant.   The hotel which situated just next to Marina Square which also have direct access to the mall. The mall also link with MRT stations, great for those who prefer to travel by public transport.

Disappointed by unaccommodating front desk experience,CP Thor,"Plus point: Check-in was brisk with minimum queue this morning. Was accorded the early check-in and late check-out with GHA black status.  Cons: I was informed by the front desk manager Ifah that no club room is available for today for upgrade. I did a quick verification on the hotel website, and I soon found two club rooms available for immediate booking. I informed the manager about the room availability online and if I can offer to pay for the upgrade to the club room. I was told no, with the explanation that those club rooms on the homepage were ""reserved"" for guests who didn't check in yesterday, and might still be arriving later this today. Ummm, I can't quite follow the logic here to be honest: if Pan Pacific can still sell the so-called ""reserved"" rooms on their website,‚Ä¶",3

Good Location and the staff are Excellent,mikejones365,"We have stayed here 18 years earlier and chose again for our 4 nights on our way back to New Zealand from Europe. The reason is the location, being just a short walk to where all the hop on hop off buses begin their tours. Quite apart from that, however is the fact that it is a very good place to stay. the rooms are well appointed and the staff are so good to you. As with most of Singapore, there are many shops and eateries nearby. Professionally run but still with a very friendly atmosphere. It takes a lot for mr to give a rating of excellent but this place comes very close.  ",4
"Fantastic stay and service, as always!",Naveed,"I stayed at the Pan Pacific, again.  The location is so great, as it connects to Suntech City, where my conference was, and to the marina bay area, where I like to take pictures.   The whole experience, from check in (a complementary upgrade) to sty in the room, and check out (I tried the new express check out, and saved considerable time)  was fantastic.  Ms Edeline Tiong, the Operations Director, herself was at hand to help with check out and to inquire about my stay and assist, even hours after my check out.   Highly recommend it !!",5
Great location and service,mike m,"We chose the Pan Pacific for my birthday on the return from Australia.  Our choice was primarily based on location which could not be faulted, close to Marina Bay and the Garden by the Bay as well as many restaurants and shops a short distance away. The service was excellent and friendly from start to finish. The excellent breakfast also made a perfect start to the day's trips.",5
Nice hotel,elizabethchiang,My husband & I went to Singapore to inspect a motor cruiser boat. We stayed 4 days 3 nights at the Marina Pan Pacific. It is well located close to 2 malls & the Esplanade MRT Station Though we arrived after 5:30pm the room was not available for 30 minutes. Management made up for this by allowing us a really late check out which was arranged by Mr Shawal ( the Lobby ambassador) Highly recommend this hotel; staff were warm & welcoming & rooms were of a high standard,5

Could not fault this hotel!",5
A hotel full of life,Hotel Trotter,"The lobby is memorable. The islands that you see from the panoramic elevators are beautiful, and the tables of each island are always occupied. The adjacent bar is always busy, especially after work hours. The location is ideal as it is close to many of the main hotels and good restaurants. The hotel also has one of Singapore's most popular night club, Bang Bang. It's easy to find your way to your room after a long night at the club :) The staff is helpful and the concierge gave me some great tips. The buffet breakfast is huge, although I couldn't recognise many of the items since they were main local/regional food dishes.",5

"Okay stay but felt club rooms underwhelming, in need of further upgrades.",Zhang P,"Booked a Pacific Club room this month and as a GHA Black Member, I was expecting a 2-tier upgrade to Pacific Harbour Studio upon booking but was told bring not given due to full occupancy of the hotel on the Saturday. I checked in at 11AM but was only given the room keys at 1PM, so I was directed to the club lounge while waiting.   Personally felt the room was okay, the view was decent, the deco features are nice but I find the rejuvenation of the club rooms from to be half done. Firstly, the bathroom looks old and dated, still adopting the marble design that doesn't really match the room interiors. Secondly, the bathtub is pretty small, smaller than Panoramic and Harbor Studio room categories. As a guy of 1.78m, I couldn't fit my entire body into the tub. Thirdly, the shower is‚Ä¶",3

My water temp when showering kept going for hot to cold to hot to cold even though I was not touching the tap, it just would not stay at a consistent temp. Also no PowerPoint in bathroom to plug in our electric toothbrush. We stayed for 4 nights in a Harbour studio, it was a bit tight with the extra bed as we are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids.

"Great Location, Great View and Best Breakfast Buffet I have ever seen",VanessaPi3,"I travel a bit for work and have been to about 20 countries and a lot of 4-5 stars hotel. The Pan Pacific is right up there when it comes to room design (ie modern enough, yet all the amenities, great size room) but what really stands out there was their breakfast. It caters for everyone's needs whether you like a Japanese breakfast, an American omelet or some curries. This was certainly a highlight. The only thing that could be better from their breakfast is the coffee. Coming from Australia, where we are spoilt with amazing coffee, this was the only thing that I thought could be improve. All in all, my stay there was very comfortable, I loved having a balcony with a view of Marina Bay Sands and love the style of the bathroom. I would stay again while in Singapore.",5
the most amazing hotel,julia_hiker,"What can I say about this incredible hotel?  Luxury!  The staff, especially Stella, were so helpful and accomodating. The lobby is outstanding,and you have to just sit there to take it all in!  The room itself had every amenity you could ask for, and it had a fantastic view.  We did get to enjoy the amazing pool grounds, which could've taken up my whole vacation right there.  We didn't try the restaurants, although they looked wonderful.  The location to Suntech Mall, Millennial Walk, and the Marina was unsurpassed!  Easy walking distance to everything.  I'd go back in a heartbeat!",5

Hotel of My Choice,FairG02125,"We went for a Mediterranean Cruise and stopped over in Singapore before arrving back home. We stayed in Pan Pacific for one night and we were totally over-whelmed. The staff were courteous patient and helpful. the room and other facilities exceed my expectation of this class of hotels. We did have some issues initally with our booking when checking-in, probably due to some mis-communication between our travel agent and the hotel, but it was resolved quickly to our utmost satisfaction. We appreciated the early check-in and late check-out. The two staff at the front desks (Risse at reception and Stephanie on Level 22) deserve our special recommendation.

Guest review ,Memuma,"Pan Pacific Singapore was a fabulous place to stay for our 4 nights. The central location was perfect for what we wanted to do. We walked a lot around the city and used cabs when we had to. The room was perfect although could have done with a second casual chair to relax  in after a hot day walking around the City to put our feet up The staff were attentive, kind, pleasant and helpful. The facilities were great, it was  easy and clean.  Great big bed to chill in. and the pool was nice to relax around. The atmosphere was nice. The Sunday afternoon tea buffet looked amazing. The food was Delicous. ",4

Fantastic and more.,Keith,"Stayed at the hotel because of an early morning run we were taking part in at the marina barrage. This is our second stay here. The first was a very good experience which was why we opted to come back. I must admit that second time round, everything just went one notch better. We were upgraded to a harbor view room, and were reminded with a nice time table, if the NDP rehearsal that evening, and we get to see the fireworks from our room! That was a brilliant start to our stay. The room, with the fabulous view, is spacious and very nice. The club lounge , as I have mentioned previously, is the best I have been to . Fantastic view, cosy, great service, food spread is decent. I really impressed me about the food at the Edge during breakfast and the lounge is that they don‚Äôt just‚Ä¶",5
Perfection,marieP8247ZN,Perfect spot in Singapore.  Pacific Club room was outstanding. The executive lounge provided wonderful views of Singapore and the best food we have had in any lounge.  Staff perfect and they know yourname after two visits to the lounge!  Wonderful pool and amazing Japanese Garden.  Breakfast was perfect.  Best place to stay in Singapore.,5
Perfect Hotel for Service and Location,MWych2204,"Perfect in everyway. The Club Lounge is stunning and worth every penny! Exceptional staff and service, particularly in the Club Lounge Location is ideal and within easy walking distance to all attractions",5
Amazing Service!!,TinaS,"A group of 15 of us just visited the Pan Pacific for High Tea. The staff of the Atrium were wonderfully attentive. A huge compliment to Sufian for outstanding service! He explained the menu options, relocated our group to accommodate the elderly members, came by to chat without ever being intrusive and even brought shawls when the ladies were cold!! A special mention also to John and Jacquline for patiently accommodating our every request. We were all smiles throughout tea, and the food was fabulous too, of course! Truly fantastic team!",5

Food not worthy and reception people not freindly,Culture17289735627,I went to.pan Pacific due to someone's reference and its fame but unfortunately my experience was not good due to anavailibilty of indian food and their taste and your reception people should b more efficient and freindly while check in,3
Pan Pacific Singapore- 5 Star Services,MESI,It was my friend and my very first time staying in Pan Pacific Singapore. We really enjoy our staying here. Mr. Shawal has been an awesome lobby ambassador. We will definitely come back for the hotel service!,5

Fantastic ,Leanne P,"What a beautiful Hotel, so close to everything and Shawal the Lobby Ambassador was so accommodating and helpful,  thanks for making our stay amazing. Will definitely be back. The room was spacious, immaculately clean and the beds and pillows were so comfortable. Unlimited complimentary water and ice delivered to your room at any time gets a big tick from me. Located in a perfect position adjoining 2 major shopping malls and in walking distance to major tourist attractions.  I really love this hotel, and can't wait to come back.",5
Nice lobby and designed hotel,Mok V,Nice decorated hotel in that building aged  Great lobby  breakfast from the edge lounge is good variety and freshness Fresh juice is nice but the staff is so busy with limited service.

Huge hotel linked by shopping malls!,Wernons,"We checked in early but our room wasn‚Äôt ready, we were asked to wait in the guest room which is far from comfortable for 3 hours! Eventually our room was ready, it was really nice, lovely and cool, just what we needed after a long flight.  Comfy bed and very clean. This hotel is centrally placed to see the sights, you can access the shopping mall by escalator from the hotel, each mall is connected and have multiple places to eat. Ask for Mr Wong, he has lots of ideas for trips that can be booked.  The Gardens on the Bay is one of our favourites. The bar prices in the hotel were expensive.  Breakfast is self service with every type of food available. An impressive hotel, I would visit again.",5
Bad experience,Tang,"I have initially booked a ""Panoramic Room"" which should have city skyline view as described in the hotel homepage. However, the room assigned to me was facing exactly opposite to Conrad hotel. The majority of the view is the windows of the opposite buildings, and the sky is hardly seen. The view is no way ""panoramic"" and I suggested the hotel to change this description as it is somewhat a fraud. I was told that I could paid SGD 30 each day to upgrade the room to ""Harbour Studio"" room type which I could view Sands Hotel and the flyer. However this is another disappointment as the upgraded room could hardly view the flyer. The room was not clean either. Dusts were found at the corners. The top bedsheet of my bed had stain on it, and it was not changed even though I have made a‚Ä¶",1

"HIGHLY RECOMMEND, Great Stay, Superb interior design, Fantastic Service",adam B,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!  This a great hotel if your traveling out and about but also if you want a day to sit and chill by the pool.  Also makes a killer singapore sling.  A great stay at this hotel for our honeymoon.  Location is great, the nearest underground is no more than 10mins walk.  Marina Bay is no more than 15mins walk and is lovely to walk along at night when it gets quieter.  There is a light show on the bay twice in the evening between 7-9pm.  The hotel has a fantastic interior design.  All the staff are super friendly and helpful.  No towel is needed for the pool as you can acquire one in the pool entrance.  We didn't have an lunch/evening meal at the hotel however the morning buffet was superb and had plenty of selection.  The hotel is only 15 mins from the airport‚Ä¶",5
A wonderful stay,FarAway15114227389,"Stayed here many times before, staff as always exceptional food very good and reasonably priced. Pan Pacific lounge excellent. Pool and fitness staff were also very helpful. Restaurant staff called me by name every day",5
Absolutely perfect!,sylviac1972,"This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in Singapore, and I do travel often! Every detail was well taken care of, and although there is always room for improvement I really want to congratulate the hotel for an overall excellent experience.   The highlights for me were: The halls and corridors of the hotel were well illuminated and airy (most hotels offer a horrible maze to get to one's room). The breakfast at Edge was really fantastic: excellent coffee quality with expresso also included, all the variety for different tastes but without losing the flavours from Singapore! I was really happy to be able to enjoy pandan leaves spread on my toast along with every other amazing recipe! Room service was really excellent quality, beautifully served, and at the right temperature.‚Ä¶",5
The Best Hotel In Singapore,William G,"Eyepopping views of the harbor, futuristic atrium and open view which elevators transcend to the top floor, friendly staff, great food and reasonable prices all make this the place to stay in Singapore.

Not a good start - part one,flufferamus,"I booked this hotel for the views, the 360 club lounge and the good reviews on trip advisor.  As we were only here for one day the afternoon tea and the evening cocktails and canapes were something we were going to avail ourselves of fully.  I had informed the hotel when booking that I am gluten free and reminded them on the telephone 24  hours before arrival.  Check in ok and we got our rooms a little before check in time at 1445.  Our rooms 3117 and 3118 had excellent views. My family tucked into the array of sandwiches, hot and cold items and superb sweets at 1500 for the afternoon tea.

Outstanding,garren j,"My wife and I spent five days at this wonderful hotel, we had an 18th floor balcony room with an amazing view.    The hotel and all of its staff were exceptional.

Almost perfect,AnnabelleLam,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Good quality of sleep, multiple MRT stations around (downtown/blue line nearer or walk abit to go to north-south/red line) and very great hospitality by staff on the ground.

Very helpful staff,Tijos103,"The staff was very helpful during my visit. At one point I was lost, and at another point I needed help moving my luggage.

Great location,David R,"We stayed at the Pan Pacific for two nights, on two occasions- two nights before, then two nights after our cruise. Whilst there are obviously numerous, International standard hotels to choose from, Pan Pacific is one that is well located for tourism on foot. An easy walk to Gardens on the Bay, Marina Bay promenade, Sun Tec shopping mall, and an acceptable walking distance ( for most) to Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. If contemplating Public transport, on arrival at Changi airport, I‚Äôd strongly recommend taking a taxi- 19 Singapore dollars, can be paid with credit/debit card in the taxi, and 20/25 minutes from pm, Check in done and dusted in 5 minutes! In the evening, the bar area has a nice buzz, International feel, plays Ibiza style chill out music, and wine prices similar to‚Ä¶",5

Perfectly fine,Jantreg,We are staying at this hotel at the beginning of our holiday. All very good. Bedrooms are clean and tidy. Hotel positioned for touring Singapore. Overall no complaints.  The shopping centres are really close. Great food in both of them. Accessing the shopping centres is very easy just through the door at the back of the hotel. Access to the tube is excellent. The coffee machine in the bedroom is a nice touch,4
Nice rooms but a painfully slow check in,Charlie G,The room we had was excellent although a little unusual.  There was a window between the bedroom and shower!  I‚Äôve been told that this is getting more popular!  There was an electric blind that could be lowered for privacy though. Electric blinds and curtains too. Painfully slow check in although I think it was just our member of staff - others seemed to zoom through compared to us. Bar is also pricey - but that‚Äôs most hotels anyway.,3
An oasis in Singapore,Grammar Queen,"I've stayed in this hotel 4 times and each stay was extremely enjoyable, with no problems or issues!  I love the location of the Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel - it's close to great shopping and good subway connections. The hotel lobby is a hive of energy - guests coming and going, staff buzzing about - lots of action here, yet the front desk staff are calm, welcoming and take their time to ensure a smooth check in or out. I've also found the concierge desk very helpful with information, directions or booking a taxi. Guest rooms are fairly typical of a 5 stars property - clean, spacious, comfy bed, spacious work area and good wifi, large TV and great views of the Singapore skyline.

Great Hotel,Maps282521,"We had stayed previously at the Swissotel but the pool was being renovated so looked for an alternative hotel within the same area. We were more than happy with the Pan Pacific and we felt that the pool area was much more appealing. The lobby area had a lovely ambience and any staff we dealt with were very helpful and accomodating. The room we had booked was a Panorama View Room which was very nice, but we had the first night and then the next day felt we would like a Harbour View Room, which was also slightly bigger. We enquired the following day and we were offered an upgrade to a harbour view room for an additional charge which was very reasonable. We were very very happy with the view of the harbour and felt this was worth the extra charge as it was a 60th birthday holiday!!‚Ä¶",5

With a special diet requirement, we got a customise menu given by the Chef from Pan Pacific.

Waiting time for the lift was not too Long. Well connected to shopping Malls such as Marina Square and Suntec without getting wet during rainy days.

We had a balcony room on the 20th floor which we loved as we had a view over the to the Marina Bay Sands which was fab!  The room itself was spacious, really nicely done with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom.  We also had breakfast with our package which was also really nice with a wide variety of goods and never had to wait for a table.

Singapore at its best,ntlberry,"Forget the Marina Bay Sands or Fullerton, the Pan Pacific offers the best that Singapore has to offer. Exceptional service, breathtaking views, wonderful facilities and a great location. The Pacific Club is a must for anyone considering premium accommodation in the city. The value for money is hard to believe in a city that gets more expensive everyday.  There is no doubt that I will be staying here in future and telling everyone I know about what a wonderful property this is. Personally, I‚Äôve never had a better hotel experience, anywhere, anytime. An absolute credit to Kurt, Jennifer and the whole team. A special mention to Hiffy, who made the Pacific Club a delight, as he went above and beyond, time and time again.",5

5 star hotel,merakimoyo,"Pan Pacific is without a doubt a nice hotel, but more if you are on vacation and not on a business trip.  Elevators are exhausting slow and malfunctioning. I had several 5-10 minute rides on the elevator to get from one room to the other especially if one room was on the lower level and the other on the higher level.   Breakfast buffet is vast, however very poor if you are looking for fresh pressed juices smoothies and other vegan options. Same in the hotel it was impossible to get a vegan snack at one of the restaurants downstairs which also applies to the room service menu.

Be prepared to do a lot of walking!  Prior to Arrival - A day before, I received a text from the Pacific Club reception. I actually liked this gesture as it makes for a nice welcome and leaves no mis-interpretation about Pacific Club's age restriction and dress code.  Check In - I arrived at 09:45am on a Sunday morning but the Pacific Club reception was not staffed. The staff turned up at 10am and I was able to check in due to my GHA Black status.

Awesome but impractical ,Chung L,"We stayed in Pan Pacific for three nights in a deluxe twin room with balcony at level 6.   The first night after the shower at 11 pm, the simple hair dryer did not work; and ended up sleeping with damp hair. The next morning all the room light also ceased to function!   The buffet breakfast were spread out in many centres but there was nothing tasty enough to excite our palate. There were better buffet breakfast experiences in nearby hotels of similar star rating, of which we looked forward every morning.   Overall feeling after three days: Awesome but impractical layout, room design and the furnishings. Appearing beautiful but failing to give comfort!  ",3
