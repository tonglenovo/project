Perfect hotel!,Christian K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this hotel in the last week!  My room, view, and the lounge were awesome, but more so were the staff Hazel, Kay, Fatimah, Luna, Ren, Lorraine, Gab and John!  They truly made me feel at home and not alone.  If I ever return to Singapore, this will be my hotel of choice again!",5,October 2022,Travelled solo
A luxury hotel with personnel remember guest!,pocky87,"Enjoyed a staycation here, but what makes this staycation different from other hotels? They remember repeated travellers!  So please allow me to list down the staff who have provided such exemplary service this time round:  In the Executive Lounge: Hazel, Gabriel, Hannah, Jerome - Hazel, Gabriel, Hannah, and Jerome provided a service that I believed would make the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach Executive Lounge experience one of the best in the world. I’ve known Hazel for a long time since my first stay back in 2017, and I was grateful that she remembered my past stays with the hotel, particularly my last 2 stays back in 2020. Hazel also provided lots of surprises and hospitality in celebrating my friend’s birthday in the executive lounge, providing a special moment that was truly memorable just like how she had provided in my past stays.  In Madame Fan: Wilson, Janet, Leon, led by Swee Boon - The team led by Swee Boon from Madame Fan has always taken great care of me and the service and experience were simply immaculate as always, and I was thankful for how Janet managed to arrange the brunch booking even at the last minute and got my favourite table corner in the main dining area. Wilson never failed to provide great recommendations and remembered my previous orders. He has provided multiple surprises and great service to celebrate my friend's birthday, making the brunch such an unforgettable one. Despite the busy hour, he will never fail to come by to interact with us and make sure that we have tried all the must-try dishes during the brunch. Madame Fan has always and will always be my favourite Marriott Bonvoy participating Chinese restaurant in Singapore, and I look forward to many more happy moments in the restaurant.  In the Beach Road Kitchen: Ashwin Badrinathan, Assistant Director of Food and Beverage - I was glad to have a brief yet pleasant interaction with Ashwin, the Assistant Director of the Food & Beverages team, who was eager to share more about the hotel’s food and dining options. The conversation went much further as I was sharing how I’ve received great hospitality from the Madame Fan service team whenever I’m there. It’s such conversation and interaction that made the stay an enjoyable one.  Front Office: Samuel Lee, Duty Manager - I'd like to congratulate you on hiring such a brilliant duty manager; I knew Samuel from another 5-star luxury hotel not too far by the Marina Bay area, where I did a staycation in 2021 when JW Marriott Singapore South Beach was still a Stay-Home Notice Hotel. I remember clearly it was my first stay in that hotel, and it was because of Samuel’s excellent first impression during the check-in and attentive service throughout my stay that made me book straight away for my second and birthday stay at that hotel. What amazed me was when I walked past the front desk in the afternoon, Samuel immediately recognized me and greeted me by my last name, even though it had been almost half a year since we last met. At the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, Samuel equally delivered one of the most personalized and hospitable services that would simply make me want to contribute more of my wallet share to this hotel. He also attended to me during my check out and we managed to share and talk more about JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, including my latest and past staycations and dining experiences in the hotel. I’m glad to see such great personnel joining one of my favourite Marriott International properties and wish him the very best at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach.…",5,June 2022,Travelled with friends
Impressive customer service,Woollyskier,"The warm, genuine, attentive customer service was impeccable!  The staff remembered our name.  And greeted us with a smile.  Always professional with outstanding attention to detail.   We stayed over the F1 Grand Prix weekend.  We could see the cars & track from EBB 6- excellent view!!  We also had a view of the track & stage from our room.    Decadent room & bed. Fun location in the city.    We used the lounge.  The best food in a hotel lounge we’ve ever experienced.  I have a long list of food intolerances  and they took very good care of me.  Chef Jerome cooked a delicious specific breakfast daily for me.  Host Hazel made the lounge feel like being welcomed into a friend’s home.  Rose at the EBB6 pool was very attentive and kind.  The staff made our hotel stay very special.  And we will definitely return.  Thank you JW!!…",5,October 2022,Travelled as a couple
Lovely hotel - shame that the attitude is so elitist!,Debbie8115,"Lifetime Gold Elite (after 8 years as platinum Elite) - I felt like a pauper checking in on a points booking amongst the Prada Princesses during Grand Prix weekend.  No recognition of my Marriott Bonvoy status, no upgrade to which I’m entitled (even though better rooms were available), generally aloof ‘you are lucky to be staying here’ attitude, no upsell of lounge access.  The room was great - although where was turndown service and replenishment of coffee supplies?  Amenities top notch.  Design amazing.  Prices sky high, location amazing especially pool overlooking GP track.  No mention of floor 18 facilities closure during GO weekend.  Lovely hotel but arrogant I’m afraid :(",3,September 2022,Travelled as a couple
"Back in Singapore for the F1, and back at the JW Marriott South Beach",ScubaDyver,"The JW Marriott at South Beach is one of the best hotels we've stayed at.  It is located adjacent to the Esplanade MRT station, for easy access to the city, and the F1 course.  The roof bar and pool actually overlook Turn 13 on the course .......  The hotel is modern, and impeccably maintained.  The staff are professional, responsive, and friendly, and extremely customer focused.  It's home to the best Executive Lounge that we've encountered in our JWM stays, which is accessible at no charge to higher end JWM rewards program members, and also to non members for a reasonable fee.  There are excellent high end restaurants adjacent to the Hotel in the old Singapore Defense Forces NCO club, and also excellent more informal restaurnts in the open are plaza adjacent to the hotel (on the way to the MRT station).  We stayed in a king sized room from which we could see (and hear) cars turning at Turn 13 on the circuit.  The room was well laid out, with a desk designed for modern work requirements with multiple outlets and the ability to tether a laptop.  The bathroom was luxurious, with full amenities, and there was plenty of storage space.  Impeccably clean and ergonomically designed.........  electrically operated day and night-time curtains were a neat touch.  As mentioned above, the Executive Club is the best that we've encountered in stays at many different JWM hotels.  It offers breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, and evening drinks.  The breakfasts offer Chinese, Indian, and western dishes along with made to order noodles, and eggs, along with a great selection of fruits and delicious pastries.    The evening hors d'oeuvres and extensive and very tasty , and drinks are excellent.  The staff  - led by Hazel  - are friendly, professional, and helpful with advice about the city.  We'd first met Hazel in 2019, and it was wonderful to see her there again.  The overall level of service in the Executive club is very impressive, and it offers the same high speed internet access as the rest of the hotel, along with some quiet areas for working while relaxing.  One of the best city hotels we've encountered, with very helpful, friendly, and professional staff.…",5,September 2022,
Come for the location but stay for the fantastic service,Sarah G,"The highlight of my recent business trip was my stay at the JW Marriott. I had the fortune/misfortune of having my trip overlap with the Singapore F1 Race, but the JW Marriott exceeded my expectations. Even though over 300,000 people were in town for the race, the JW felt like an oasis. The room was great, but the service made the stay stand out. Specifically, Hazel in the Executive lounge was excellent. She exudes warmth while delivering five-star service. I can say with confidence that she was the highlight of my stay and why I will always choose the JW Marriott when I come back for work or pleasure.",5,October 2022,Travelled on business
Wedding Dinner,17awesome,"We just had our wedding on 17 September 2022 at JW Marriott South Beach and the event was everything we hoped for. Our greatest thanks will have to go to Chanel Tan, the assistant director of events. She ensured that our experience was a positive and thoroughly reassuring one. She remained responsive, reliable and always accommodating our requests within the best of her capacity. She also remained professional throughout, attends to the smallest of details, and wears the most welcoming smile during all our meetings. She is truly someone whom I think Marriott needs to value as she is truly competent and capable, and this is not without backing. We first engaged Marriott for our wedding banquet dinner early 2021, and halfway there was a change of our liaison from Theresa to Chanel, inviting a lot of concerns for me and my wife. Thankfully, Chanel not only addressed this with a smooth transition, she also exceeded our expectations subsequently which culminated in an unforgettable wedding experience for the both of us.  We would also like to thank the other people involved including Nuttee for being responsive and thorough, ensuring the dinner went ahead smoothly, including our after-party which was an exhilarating one with our guests. Eugene from AV also handled our wedding schedule and lighting well, and the sumptuous meal prepared by Chef Raymond and his team.  Overall, a very positive experience and we will strongly recommend our friends to consider having their special day at JW Marriott itself. We also look forward to our anniversary stay as the hotel rooms and staff service were great too.…",5,September 2022,

In addition to its stunning architecture, they are wonderful people, in a great location with easy access to the Metro.

The Food Services staff makes this hotel great,Mae Wag,"My husband and I enjoyed 6 days at the JW Marriott. The hotel is beautiful and centrally located, but what really sets it apart from other beautiful hotels where we have stayed during our travels is the exceptional staff in the Executive Lounge.

Hazel and Kartik especially extended themselves in ensuring that we had everything that we needed and treated us like friends.

The property is well situated with an easy walk, cab or train to many of the city’s desirable neighborhoods. It is well designed and maintained but what sets it apart is the staff. Front front desk to engineering to housekeeping, all were responsive and provided great service. The very best was the superior service of the Food and Beverage staff, especially in the Executive Lounge. Hazel and the rest of the folks went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and well cared for throughout our stay.

Celebrating Singapore’s National Day,Edward Lai,"After being grounded in Hong Kong for 2-3 years, I was finally able to travel again and Singapore was my first stop. I was staying at this property for 5 nights, thanks to my Marriott Bonvoy Titanium status, I was upgraded to a room with the Marina Bay View and that was perfect since I was able to watch the fireworks in the comfort of my room.   I’ve always heard about the iconic swimming pool at the hotel, so I went up to the wellness floor and I was greeted by Prasanth Nedumpurath at the gym. He showed me around and walked me through all the wellness facilities at the hotel. Thanks for the guided tour and I can tell he very much loves his hotel.

First impressions,Jpap,Just arrived. Looks like a nice hotel and everyone welcoming. As an Ambassador Elite was upgraded to a family room however since it is my sister and I preferred two beds (sorry but not interested in sleeper sofa).  Only rooms were normal (premium twin beds). It’s disappointing that a hotel this size doesn’t offer two doubles or queens.  Hoped for a high floor with a view but no luck there.   Executive lounge looks nice and everyone is very smiling and accommodating.  Will update as trip progresses in facilities. They recommend a reservation for breakfast or take your chances as a walk in.  First Marriott I have seen where they do this. Not sure if it’s Covid related or due to size.,4,September 2022,Travelled with family

Excellent service at Executive Lounge and Great Breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen. Pity the room was a letdown.,Ian D,Our stay at the hotel was made immensely better at the executive lounge. Hazel served us during the happy hour and throughout the visits to the lounge and her bubbly nature made the visits there more fun.  Drinks on offer were great and we spent the evenings here in the lounge.  The breakfast variety served at the Beach Road Kitchen was vast. Quality was good.   The reason why this review did not get 5stars was the pathetic room size. It was supposed to be Premium room but you cannot tell by the size.

Amazing fireworks seen from Marina Bay view room and excellent executive lounge,Veronica N,"Spent a good 3 nights' stay at this property. Thanks for the celebratory cake and warm hospitality from the staff at executive lounge. Special mention goes to Hazel who helped us to get drinks earlier than the usual 5.30pm so that we can go up to watch NDP from the comfort of our room by 6pm. I used their mobile chat services and the replies are always prompt. Remember to go to the EBB6 pool instead of the one at level 18 as the one at level 18 is too chilly for a swim. You have to go to the East tower by taking the lift and crossing the bridge at level 2, then head to level 6.",5,August 2022,

She’s very friendly and joyous.  It’s great to see her around (during afternoon tea break and evening session). Really  brighten up one’s day. Great asset to the company.   Another person that I would like to comment is the duty manager (Samuel lee) on my day 1 of check in. He has gone an extra mile to help with the booking of a dinner (Madam fan) despite it was fully booked initially. Upon several checks (with the restaurant), there is finally an available table of 6 during my 2nd day stay.   Once again,…",5,April 2022,Travelled with friends

Also excellent service at the Beach Road kitchen during breakfast. Always so warm even though they are busy.,5,April 2022,Travelled as a couple
Hits and Misses,MelvinLin,"The room is comfortable, hotel amenities are alright.   Service is good too - the people at the Executive lounge as well as Housekeeping on Level 11  were all very friendly and helpful. They definitely made us feel welcome.  On this occasion, the bonus was that the pandemic restrictions were eased only about a week before our stay. They were therefore more flexible with timings for the lounge visits, visits to the pool no longer required prior reservations, and we could also move around to pick up our food at breakfast.  There were however some misses on this stay - a few of them were related to maintenance: 1. Bathroom door desperately needs some lubricating. My children could not close or open them on their own, and even for the adults it felt like weights training in the gym.…",3,April 2022,
Superb Service,Rosy,I had a staycation with my friends in JW it was one of the best staycay ever. The hotel was very nice and clean. The staffs were friendly. We had lounge access and it was great.

Solid 5 star hotel,Shen_Jackson,"I was quite happy with this hotel.  The only complaint that I had was the views aren't great because of the location.  However, everything else is great.  The rooms are luxurious, lots of closets, a good working area and lighting, a comfortable bed, and an amazing bathroom.  Breakfast was a highlight of the stay.  I'll stay here again.",5,April 2022,Travelled on business
JW Marriott Does it Again!,Tricia F,"This is my third time staying at the JW Marriott Singapore. As always, they have knocked it out of the park! The team at the Executive Lounge is fabulous! Hazel greeted me everyday with a warm smile and remembered my name and drink preferences. Others were quick to bring food platters, tea, water, etc. I have traveled the world and this Executive Lounge is the best. Due to Covid, they have moved to a touchless menu (QR code) but still ensue the provision of high quality delectable food, tea, and wine! This trip I had the pleasure of meeting Cora and Aubrey Seow, the director of sales and marketing for the JW and St Regis in Singapore 🇸🇬. I appreciated their genuine interest regarding my trip. I'm so glad Singapore has opened back up! Now is the time to return.  I look forward…",5,April 2022,Travelled on business

"Professional service from staff, questionable room and lounge decor",Keith,"Was upgraded to a Club room as per benefits of GHA entitlement. Room had electrical problems, Wizalina was extremely apologetic and reassigned us to another room, impressed with the initiative & empowerment of the staff.  After settling in the room, a bottle of Porsecco was sent to the room, appreciate the service recovery from Wizalina. Good effort to go beyond to make our stay a memorable one.  Would also comment on the service staff of the Lounge, Madame Fan and Akira Back (Sue). All my  dining experiences were made memorable by the friendly and warm staff.   The food at both Madame Fan and Akira Back were both outstanding, we will be revisiting them again.",4,March 2022,

Awesome service,Bryan S,"The hotel is wonderful. The room was comfort and the esthetic was space (white marble wall finishing and many Morden artistic furniture). Customer Service was awesome, especially staff Hazel gave excellent service in the executive lounge (very welcoming and attentive to customer's needs). There’s a rooftop area with a pool, can play billiard/table tennis/table soccer, seating and views across the city (awesome view). I hardly gave reviews to hotels but their services is worth giving.

Exceptional service in a gorgeous hotel,waynecom7,"The hotel is beautiful and very contemporary.  The room was lovely - huge bed and amazing pillows. Breakfast was in the next tower - a really cool dining space with lots of options. Due to Covid everything is behind glass but the staff are there to serve you. Great coffee. There’s a fantastic rooftop area with a pool and seating and views across the city. The hotel is really fantastic. However, even this beautiful hotel pales when compared to the staff. The service was exceptional. Consistently and everywhere. From the lovely reception staff, to the team in the executive lounge who use your name each time they speak to you. Every member of staff acknowledges you even if they are some distance away.  I sat down in the executive lounge and within seconds a staff member brought me…",5,March 2022,
Great location but not practical for business,Ajit,"Pros Great location, raffles opposite, great restaurants and bars seconds away.   Modern hotel with a nice vibe  Rooms are modern. They come with a japanese toilet (a toilet with a brain). It drives me nuts but has heated seats...  However the cons Rooms are small. Last time I stayed at the four seasons and sizeable difference in the basic room.  WiFi is unstable. This makes it untenable for me to stay at  next time I come to Singapore. FYI my colleague faced similar issues so this isn't an android /iPhone issue.  Breakfast is awful. We often go to Starbucks (ten seconds away) immediately after for a 'proper' coffee.  Hotel is a great location but the small rooms coupled with unstable Internet, its unlikely to become my Singapore Hotel (a shame as I just switched to starwood…",3,March 2022,

Starting from front office, check in was easy breezy with Jonathan, i think (im sorry i did not write it down). Since I was celebrating my bestie's birthday, we had a suprise cake and a personalised birthday greeting sent up personally to the room. My bestie was over the moon. The club room was the best, spacious and we had a spectacular view. The long sofa by the window was very thoughtful. The swimming pool on the 18th floor was great. Since its an indoor pool u can swim and enjoy the view at any time of the day. We went up quite late into the night before the pool closed, but we still managed to dip our toes and enjoy the spectacular…",5,February 2022,

Demands are quickly met.  The slippers are very good quality and comfy.  The breakfast and high tea have good spread. Suggest breakfast to have some changes over Sat and Sun.

"Back again after Covid, Excellent in everything!",HK1966LB,"First time in Singapore after Covid: this hotel is still superb as I remember it. Location is just over 3 MRT stops; walking distance (at least walking for me) to CBD, Singapore river, and to Fort Canning. But the service is simply perfect: starting from the housekeeping that were leaving small messages every day, to the business lounge (the buffet has been changed into a kind of afternoon tea, which is very rich) to everyone in the hotel. I will never think of another location when I will be in Singapore.",5,March 2022,
Amazing staff members,Jojo,"Will go straight to the point.. Been patronising many 5 star hotels and lounges but what sets JW apart are the staff.  The loveliest experience is at the lounge.

Perfect staycation at JW Marriott,Jasrin,"Had a wonderful stay at JW Marriott! Warm and friendly service from the front desk team and thank you for taking care of all our special requests. Special thanks to Haris for delivering a hand-written cake and the anniversary cake for our celebration. Lovely gesture. Deluxe room is small but still cosy for us. Flow18 pool has great views overlooking the Marina Bay district. Had an enjoyable dinner with our 3-course meal at The Akira Back and a hearty breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen too.

Great Service by Front Desk,Mylo1234,First time to this hotel. Just wanted to express my thanks to a fantastic warm reception by Alex. I wanted to upgrade but there were no club lounge. Alex was so patient explaining how to upgrade and went out of the way to show me room I currently have deluxe. I was totally impressed and decided to change to higher end room even without seeing the better room.  I cannot wait to see how the room.and club lounge is like. Alex made my day. Last whole week been calling in but so difficult to get one he managed to do magic. Great Job and service Alex. Thanks,5,March 2022,
Upgrade to an executive room solely for the hospitality that awaits in the executive lounge!,MrJohn55,"We took full advantage of our executive room’s access to the lounge and all it entailed. We were welcomed daily in the stylish and eclectically furnished lounge for afternoon tea, hor d’oeuvres and cocktails. Phillipe Starck furniture and modern artwork gives a contemporary feel and the hospitality was warm,  engaging and extremely generous. Every visit we were greeted with a genuine warmth and as fondly as we were family members. We’d love to pay particular credit to those who looked after us most: Hazel, Antonio, Kay, Irene, Immanuel and Cora created an impeccable customer experience for us.  Afternoon tea was served on a cake stand with delicious different daily delights of sandwiches, cakes and scones. In the evening the chef Mong Song created more delights including…",5,February 2022,
Moderate and Meh - Marriott can do better,Cphwilliams,"I've stayed at hotels all over, including here in Singapore.  I also want to acknowledge the pandemic is still a thing and people are trying their best.  This hotel was perfectly adequate, but felt closer to a Renaissance than a true JW Marriott, what is supposed to be their flagship brand.  All requests were met with delays and hesitation.  The Executive lounge booked up a week in advance.  The pool was cold and had little seating.  Breakfast was a zoo - hard to get drinks.  I ended up checking out a day early.  I was tired of not feeling welcome.  Save your money and go elsewhere",2,February 2022,
Started with a few hits but ended with BIG miss,17Beckykh,"My husband & I had a staycation at JW Marriott over the weekend for our fifth wedding anniversary.   Here are the hits: - Check-in was smooth, the room was small but cosy. The bathrobes are the bomb! Extra soft, comfy & lightweight. - Swimming pool has one of the best views in town! - The highlight our stay was our experience at the Executive Club. The staff made the effort to engage with us, check-in for additional drinks & food. A big shoutout to Cora who sent a bottle of wine to our room and when she heard it was our anniversary. Hazel who made her version of mojito which was packed with a punch. Also to Irene and the rest of the service team who ensured we never ran out of drinks & food. - Breakfast at Beach Road kitchen had one of the best spreads we’ve had considering the…",4,February 2022,

Great staycation,Prince L,"Had a great staycation at JW Marriott. Room was supposed to have Marina Bay view, however, we were at level 11 (room 1116), we can’t really see the Bay view. Room was clean and spacious, mini bar was empty though.   Swimming pool comes with a great view. Both day and night views are great!   We were also very happy to be served by Hazel at the Executive lounge. We had some minor issue but was quickly resolved by Hazel. She’s very friendly and approachable.   Also, I must  say the breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen was great too. Service was great, so is the food.  Overall was a good stay, and service was quite good.",5,February 2022,

Lunch Buffet - Good Stuff.,Darrell,Had lunch at Beach Road Kitchen on 26 Feb 2022.. Very good quality of food and drinks with a decent spread both in terms of breath and depth - this in turn translates to value of money in terms of the price for the lunch buffet.

"Nice looking hotel, but musty smell needs to be fixed",Sonia P,"Interesting experience at JW Marriott, after staying at Marina Bay Sands for the first part of our trip.   JW Marriott don’t have Bell Boys which we have not seen before in a 5 star hotel. The reception was quiet. Communications with Trisha (Cluster Reservations Executive) in advance of our stay was terrible. 4 weeks before our stay, she informed us that we could have our executive lounge breakfast delivered to our room if we were in isolation awaiting test results. Then the day we were arriving she emailed, and informed us that this was no longer able to be accommodated.. the day we were arriving???? I replied and never heard back from her. Odd!!  We did have breakfast delivered but it was all in take-away containers. Quite the opposite of what you would expect from a 5 star…",3,February 2022,

His warm hospitality really made a positive impact on our stay.   Breakfast at the Beach Road Kitchen was one of the highlights of our stay. Compliments to the F & B Manager, Ashwin, for keeping the food quality high and offering a wide variety of local delights such as Laksa, Porridge, Nasi Lemak, and even Otak Otak, which I have not seen in years.

The room was spacious and comfortable with a lovely bathroom and a free standing bathtub and a lovely view of the city. We were also presented with a scrumptious chocolate mousse cake and fruit platter in the room!   The room came with executive lounge access which had to be pre booked.

"DISAPPOINTING stay at a hotel we expected so much from. ""5 stars""?? I don't think so",ZM,"My wife and I stayed at JW for our honeymoon and we were shocked at how tiny the hotel room was for the crazy price we paid for the room. For $550, we were expecting a generous sized room with a room in good condition but not only was the wallpaper peeling badly in our room, there were stains all over our wardrobe. We tried sending feedback about our bad stay via email and NOBODY even bothered responding to us. Yeah sure the pool is nice with a nice view but majority of the rooms do not face Marina Bay and on the advertised photos, the photos falsely advertised a Marina Bay View outside. Overall a bad stay at a ""5 star"" hotel with absolutely terrible recovery service by the hotel.",1,December 2021,

Nice contemporary hotel in the Singapore city centre,DSSG08,"Stayed 3 nights on a solo ""workcation"". Like most JWs, this hotel is contemporary and luxurious but not ostentatious like St Regis.

This hotel is almost directly above Esplanade MRT station and a 5 minute walk to City Hall MRT.  The infinity pool on the 18th floor is great for views of the city bit too tiny for a doing laps. To my disappointment, the 6th floor lap pool was closed when I visited.  Tip: if you like a lot of sunlight, the rooms facing Beach Road may not be ideal as the facade blocks some ot it.

Great exterior undone by some odd interior design flaws,snowbunny35,Sir Norman Foster's architectural tour de force is quite undone by whoever did the interior design. I stayed in a suite which had great views of the padang but it seems that the interior designer must not have thought much of the views - he or she put a huge block with a TV in it right in front of the window in the living room. Fortunately the bedroom have great views with it being a corner as does the bathroom. Opening the bathroom door should be included as one of the 12 tasks of Hercules! It is not for the faint hearted or weak of body - requiring a Herculean task. Also it seems the interior designer has something against hooks - there are none in the bathroom to hang your stuff up on.

More than enough of fluffy towels and aromatic bath amenities are provided. The « at your service » line and staff is very pleasant and accommodating.

Lovely large bed and automatic curtain features.  Plenty of storage space.         Now the negatives.

However, it was a huge disappointment to end up in a room basically facing a part-rusty, part-concrete wall and with some roof structure above the windows, making it virtually impossible to see the sky nor have any kind of view. To spend two weeks in what is more or less equivalent to a basement is not acceptable. Hoping to stay sane the remaining 7 days...

I feel the charges for renting equipment are too high and no “one week” option was presented. I’d have borrowed a vacuum cleaner if a day rate was available. Same for the spin cycle which I’d have rented for a week.   It would have been great to have access to the Euro championships at a price.",4,May 2021,Travelled solo

In addition, I had 3 pieces of large luggage and they were able to help me take 2 of them up to my room when I was checked in. In my previous SHN, I was informed that they cannot help me since they are not allowed to touch my luggage. I am grateful that JW Marriott was more flexible and accommodating. I wished that my room has a balcony but I was informed that none of the rooms in the hotel has a balcony.

Best quarantine experience so far,Justin L,"I’m one of those very unfortunate people who have had to travel multiple times during these pandemic years. This is my fourth quarantine, so I’m very used to long stays in hotel rooms. Having that experience does not guarantee a good stay, however. Where you are stuck for two weeks can make a tremendous difference in how well you weather the storm.  So if, like me, you’re going to be stuck anywhere  for two weeks, may I suggest the JW Marriott? The nearly floor-to-ceiling windows provide a literal and metaphorical window into the world so that you don’t feel so isolated during your stay. The menu was carefully crafted, and I will genuinely miss some of the delicious food I’ve had here. And although I rarely needed anything, whenever I did service was prompt, polite, and…",5,May 2021,

During the registration, information shared by her was cleared and she assisted to book our dinner reservation with Beach Road Kitchen. She even wish my wife birthday during the check-in. Kudos.  When we came back around 9-10pm, a birthday cake was placed in the apartment with a birthday card written by Front office staff ""Helen Chen"". We was surprise and happy with her action. Job well done.  Overall experience was Exceptional. Hotel are located near Suntec City.    Will definitely come back again next time.

Wonderful Staycation with excellent service!,Andy_ojx,"There are so many good things I have to say about this hotel,   First off  We arrived at 1130am (we booked thru klook so we had an early check in at 12pm and a late checkout at 3pm as part of our package)  on the phone with the reservations team, they said they can't guarantee that there will be rooms available - which we understand completely so we wasn't expecting to get our room until afternoon.  We were greeted by Mr. Talgat Yermekbayev and told us not ONLY was our room ready for check in (which my girlfriend and I was pleasantly surprised) they've also upgraded our Deluxe suite booking into a Premium suite!

Premium prize - budget hotel experience,LinenBank,"I have stayed several hundreds of nights in Marriott group hotels. My understanding is that Courtyard is the lower end, Marriott is one step better and JW Marriott is the highest level. All these hotels are nice. This hotel although named as JW Marriott doesn't reach the Courtyard level and it brings nothing of the Marriott style and experience.  Let me explain why. Hotel lobby is not welcoming it is strangely shaped and the decoration is not aesthetic, secondly you enter the lift and get lightshow and the lift definitely doesn't have enough light, just irritating changing colors. I started to wonder if this hotel is meant for young clientele? Then the room itself - I have stayed in budget hotels and some of the hotel chains use pre-installed modules that are just assembled on…",1,February 2021,
Fabulous Stay,Khai Shah,"Stayed for one night. Great hotel. Love the hotel ambiance. Nice decor and well kept very classy without being ostentatious. Room is clean. Huge bathroom. Love the big tub! The pool view was awesome in the night. Overall, i had a lleasant stay. Only had problems during check out. Waited for almost 20 minutes to get clearance. My grab car waiting. Apparently the Front Desk cashier did not post in my $100 incidental deposit and no receipt was issued to me upon check in.

Room was very dusty and stuffy at my check-in. Chair to seat and work for several hours is not comfortable. There should be another chair to drop clothes on it. Appreciate the fast internet connection. Source button on the remote should be unblocked to quickly switch between tv and laptop, instead of pressing the rear button on the tv. Appreciate the choice of channels. The Toto WC and the speakers in the bathroom are the highlight of the room. No Windows with a fresh air is a common problem in Singapore hotels.

Upon request, we were upgraded to the city view room as a birthday goodwill gesture. Made my stay even more enjoyable.  The overall experience during my stay was awesome. BUT wish to feedback the breakfast selection. Can’t help to feel underwhelmed(not the selection of food) but the fact that we can only order the menu set ONCE. Personally feel the items available for repeat order is nothing to shout about(service of the staff was very good) Of course I blame COVID 19 for this.

Enjoyable staycation!,Baybayyy,"Stayed in the deluxe room for 2 nights and really enjoyed the room. Room was clean and modern. Bathrobes felt very luxurious which I was grateful for. Was also very grateful for the bathtub as the water in the swimming pool was very cold so at least I could have a “swim” in the bathtub in the room. View from the pool was great though! Nice place to relax and chill out. Had complimentary breakfast and the staff, Flora, took care of us and made sure we were very full before leaving.

Great staycation weekend,Ralph R,My wife and I stayed for one night at the JW Marriott Singapore. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Suits with Executive Lounge access.

Deluxe Room & Hotel Review,Roy PJJ,"Hotel room was clean and comfortable, however, there were some things malfunctioning. The automated curtains and blinds were not working, fortunately the curtains were closed as the room I was on was facing a little garden (only accessible by staff at the moment). The deluxe room came with a bath tub which is one of the differences compared to the studio room.   Hotel staff were friendly and accommodated to our request to stay in the main building. Location is good too! Just a stone throw away from Esplanade MRT and Suntec City just opposite. Carpark is also provided by the hotel.  The view from the swimming pool is fantastic! Absolutely love it! ",4,February 2021,Travelled as a couple

Stunning deal: Experience Spa Package,chrismenon,"If you've ever been to the W Hong Kong, this hotel is like it's twin sister. It's unusual compared to other JW Marriotts, but that isn't a bad thing. The pool deck is absolutely spectacular and I could stay there all morning.  The Experience Spa package was worth every penny, you get 2 complimentary massages included and breakfast for 2, along with your room. Honestly, the package costs as much as 2 massages in a typical 5 star hotel spa, so from that angle you're pretty much paying for 2 massages and getting a room along with it. Great deal and I hope its here to stay.

The room is comfortable, modern and spacious, we got a room upgraded to a marina bay view with late check out probably due to platinum elite. We did find a leftover used fork on the floor but we just left it there as we didn't want to make a fuss over a small overlook by housekeeping.

I would like to also compliment Chef Jerome for his hospitality and engaging small conversations with us on the food.

Most wonderful hotel in Singapore probably,Vin123,"Being a local, I have always been critical of Singapore appalling service standards. JW Marriott, South Beach proved me wrong. All the staff from check in to executive lounge to pool attendants, to chamber maids to breakfast resturants and in room service meals delivery are tip top. You can see clearly that the hotel is a bit short of staff during covid when the foreigner staff are not allowed in, they really worked together. I see the check in staff also appearing in breakfast resturant helping out and the hotel manager was seen everywhere that I went doing the actual work. The hotel is also in excellent location and right above a MRT and the rooms are beautiful and totally sound proof. I will come back again!",5,December 2020,

Good,Trace,"Stayed 2 nights with my girlfriends at the hotel. They have a clean, spacious room and the look of it is aesthetically pleasing. Comfortable bed and I absolutely love the bathtub. Hotel with the best location, just right beside the Esplanade MRT and a number of malls. Their pool at Level 18 is windy and has a great view, very instagram worthy. Now you will need to make a booking fast when you check-in to enter it though.   One thing I would comment is the service of the staff. I guess because they were too overwhelmed by the volume of guests in the hotel and lack of manpower, the staff probably had difficulty to keep up to 5 star hotel standards.

I don't blame Ms. Mary but it was really too much when she replied with ""It's not my position to say whose fault this is."" Oh, so i guess it must be MY fault for choosing this hotel then, since it's no one's fault at JW Marriott. Finally I got my room 1, but room 2 was still cleaning until 7pm.

My only main gripe was the framed art in the room, it's a bit scary to sleep facing it at night. Breakfast buffet spread the next morning seemed rather limited, not sure if that's the usual spread. The staff came over with a birthday cake again and sang a birthday song - only to my horror that the addressed me - 'Mandy/Wendy' and weren't sure of my name, likewise on the birthday card.

"Experience with some staff a little frustrating. Some furnishings are fancy, but other times show lack of thought.",Shawn W,"For a JWM brand, experience with some staff a little frustrating.

It doesn’t make any sense why we’re issued x01 and x04.  We were then told to stay in x01 instead.  x01 had a sofa bed which is supposed to be extended for the 3rd person, but upon attempting you’ll quickly realize the sofa bed, already pushed to the edge touching the windows, cannot be fully deployed without moving the king bed, which is more challenging than one expects.

The definition of service,Hawkeye_1960,"I was sold to the rooms of the swisshotel but trying the JW has been the best thing I could have done. The personnel is beating all previous service experiences I had. The exec lounge is great but on the low floor level (2). This is a little drawback from the 70th floor view of the Swiss. However, the JW Marriott exec lounge has a better suited in my opinion, bar area with giant screen conducive to great conversation. The swimming pool is just awesome at the 18th floor wit a breath taking view of Marina Bay and downtown SG. A little drawback is in the bathrooms. I tried 3 different room models and none had an electrical outlet in the bathroom. There is no 110V in the room altogether but te concierge quickly solved this issue by providing me with a converter.

12 days of great service and friendly smiles in Singapore,Happi Rambler,"The JW on Beach Road was a fantastic stay, especially for a long business stay.   The service in the Lounge was fantastic, Chef John, Olive and the bar staff became almost friends in the couple weeks that I stayed at the JW.   They made a long business trip not only bearable, but fun.   They were always happy to talk, help with anything and suggest things to do over the weekend.  Such as a great hike in MacRitchie Resevoir park. Staff at the JW Marriott make it a reason to return again.",5,October 2019,Travelled on business
Excellent customer service and attention to details.,ril_zd,"Very impressive experience right from getting down from the car with the welcoming reception by its lobby ambassador; Lisa.  Although my sleep were disturbed by loud shouting noise from the adjacent room in the middle of the night, the hotel staff were very apologetic on it upon my check out although it was not their fault. Vivien Lee at front desk even offered to waive my breakfast which was a nice gesture.  All in all, great staff.",5,February 2020,Travelled on business

When loyalty is misused,i-love-zermatt,"I like the brand - this is why I’m Lifetime Platinum and then they gave me an Ambassador status. I like the hotel - this is why I came back for the fourth or fifth time within 12 months. I like #Singapore - this is why I extended my 6 nights stay for another couple of days. What I don’t like, though, is to be treated as a fool. You guys had me for 630 ++ in a suite and when I extended, you had the audacity to ask for almost 250 more. Seriously? Have you been at capacity? Was there a huge conference? Was it that Singapore was sold out? NO!!!

The disco lights in the lifts, the decor and most importantly the toilets in the room! Once you experience those toilets - there’s no going back. You would know what I mean once you stay there :)   We stayed in a lounge access room and it felt very spacious with modern finishes. Although the carpet on the floor looked a bit worn with strings hanging out of it. Not a great look! We had a semi ok view facing the suntec city shopping centre and a bit of the Marina.

Rooms are spacious and have large windows. the executive lounge is over the top great and location at South Beach next to Raffles Hotel is fantastic. Lots of great restaurants and bars to choose. But the real stars at the JW are the staff....Up in the exec lounge Eva, Esther, Srankvi, Yosuf  and Andrea were incredibly helpful and friendly!! Matin at the front desk gave us a great art tour of south beach and Nicola at Cool Cats jazz bar was also great. If you like Marriott at it's best this is for you when in Singapore.",5,January 2020,

Fantastic modern hotel,sfoartboy,"There really is nothing bad to say about this hotel. First the service really is excellent, which is something that hotels often make empty promises about, but the JW Marriott really delivers. Very professional without being obsequious. The rooms are clean and fresh looking, with bidet toilets. I really like the couches along the windows as well. The suites have in-room Nespresso while the regular ones only have instant coffee, which is a bit disappointing. I would definitely opt for a club room, as the lounge has an elaborate food spread for breakfast, and wine, cocktails, and pretty good food in the evenings.

The room and the rest of hotel is decorated in a modern luxurious style. The hotel is in a great location to walk to many places. And the service was consistently professional, warm and welcoming.

Not very large for sure but adequate. Pool on the 18th floor was nice, good view of downtown. The gym is also up here fairly large for a good workout. The spa was very nice. I went down to hit the steam and sauna. If you have time good place to relax.   The hotel sits atop an area of shops, restaurants and pubs. It's extremely convenient to get out of the hotel for a bite to eat or cocktail. The MRT Esplanade is also underneath the hotel so easy to get around. The Executive lounge is across a walkway.

The hotel was clean, with a very modern feel.  The staff were amazing.  From Hai Yang in housekeeping to Hazel and Melvin in the Executive Lounge- every staff member we interacted with was friendly and helpful.  Hai Yang went above and beyond when cleaning our room, Hazel had great suggestions for places to visit, and Melvin made wonderful drinks.  I loved the location- being across from SunTec made it very easy to catch the MRT, a bus, or call a Grab to go out and see the city.  It was also great to have such a wide variety of shopping options so close so we could pick up anything we forgot (and some kaya from Ya-Kun for friends and family back home).",5,November 2019,

Gem in the heart of South Beach,Anders W,We stayed here for 5 nights as part of a longer trip between Asia and India.

We spent the majority of our hotel time in the executive lounge and were blown away by the attentiveness of the staff as well as the quality of the food offerings.

I would like to commend Melvin, the check-in agent at the executive lounge who was extremely friendly and courteous. Unlike other hotels we've been to the past, Melvin encouraged us to take the drinks from the fridge for our consumption in the room. As an Ambassador member, we were upgraded to the Deluxe Junior Suite facing the Marina Bay - a spectacular view, and they even returned our 2 Suite Night Awards as they could not offer the best available room at that time.

One of our favorite properties,Allen L,"We loved everything about of our stay here.  The hotel is incredibly modern and nice and the staff is attentive to your every need.  Our favorite part was the Executive Lounge happy hour they have for members which was extremely well organized and a place where you could have drinks before dinner.  The breakfast was also delicious.  The spa was one of the best we've ever been too.  Finally, the location was close to many of the destinations you want to go to in the marina.  Would highly recommend!",5,December 2019,
Great Hotel,snchip,We really liked this hotel. The staff is so friendly and helpful. The rooms and bathrooms are nice and quiet.  It seemed in a very convenient location for everything that we wanted to see will visiting. The breakfast buffet was one of the best ones that we've had in a long time. Well worth the cost.  We stayed 4 nights and then came back for 1 night at the end of our trip before heading to the airport.,5,December 2019,
Warm Welcome,Stanley Yong,"I had a great check in experience on the day, I went to one of staff named Lisa which I initially thought was the receptionist to be in charge of the check in process, however Lisa was actually a lobby ambassador and the check in counter was at the other side. She was very helpful and polite, showed and lead the way to the check in counter, upon seeing the counter being busy, she didn’t just leave us there waiting but took the initiative to check in for us which I really see her giving an extra mile in work. On a side note, I even received a hand written card from her upon checked into the room with warm welcome that was really out of my expectation. I really appreciate for whatever she had done, and it really enhances my stay in the hotel. ",5,December 2019,Travelled with friends

Bad experience to usher in Year 2020,MrsSeow,"I did a booking for a 3d2n stay at the executive club room to usher in the new year only to find that my room key did not work since I arrived at 2.30pm at the premises. Even the porter tried with the master key and it did not work. I was told that the door handle is spoilt and needed about 30mins to repair. So I was ushered to the executive lounge to have tea, and was told that I will be informed when my room is ready. 30mins went by, I finished my tea and still no one came to tell me that my room was ready. I approached the counter at the lounge and a staff helped me to check, only to be told that it's taking an even longer time to rectify the fault.

Outstanding Hotel,Peter M,"My wife and I visited Singapore to celebrate our 10th anniversary and we couldn't have made a better choice. This is a stylish hotel in a convenient location but what really stands out is the quality of staff and the service they provide. From the moment we checked-in to the moment we departed they couldn't have been more helpful. I stay at Marriott hotels almost every week and this hotel is right at the top of my list. I need to specifically mention Jusanna the Lobby Ambassador who went out of her way to decorate our room in an anniversary style complete with balloons, cake and a lovely personal note.

Sensational Singapore,washington_wahine,"Spent a few days here post cruise to R&R prior to returning home.  It is quintessential JW and matches the beauty and opulence that Singapore has on tap these days.  Rooms are large and comfortable with luxurious bathrooms complete with soaking tub, Toto automated toilets, and wall to wall mirrors.  The executive lounge is very well run, with full bar, plentiful food options both western and local, and smiling service.  The spa, with its jacuzzi, steam room and sauna are just bliss.  But the topper is the pool on the 18th floor - the views are just beautiful, and even better from the coolness of a crystal clean pool with a tall drink in your hand.  I'm sure the MBS pool has a better view, but this pool you'll have to yourself, along with plenty of upscale loungers bathed in cool…",5,November 2019,

My room was a studio, but I didn't feel cramped. Plenty of room to unpack and felt spacious. Bathroom had plenty of liquids and towels. The TV was large. The bed was very comfortable. I used the workout room. Plenty of machines. Very clean. The executive lounge was very nice. See picture of the media area. The lounge maybe the best part of staying here. The food and beverage was fantastic. The staff were even better than the F&B. I especially enjoyed Hazel's service, but everyone was very hospitable.

Misleading hotel,Naved S,"There a lot of expensive hotels to choose from in Singapore, so before you short list the JW Marriott here, a few clarifications you should know:  (1) though they have 2 pools, they do NOT have any pool chairs that recline, which you would expect. Even a budget highway side Hampton Inn in the US with a small indoor pool has pool recliner chairs. Only the lower pool has 4 (only 4) sun lounge type chairs, but they are placed in the shallow end of the pool in the middle of the water, so not very practical place to park your pool belongings. The effect is even when the pool is practically empty, you still have to fight over/claim early even these submerged loungers.

Amazing hotel! Service level really high!,Robin L,"We stayed for 3 night in this hotel and it was in one word: Amazing! The staff is very helpfull and friendly. Nazurah from the front desk check us in and give a lot information about the hotel and Singapore, her service level was outstanding! Also the Dutch guy Steven Janssen was really kind and told us a lot about Singapore and he gave us the tip to eat sate at Gardens by the Bay! Joey from the reception was our whole stay really helpfull! Would love to come back here!",5,October 2019,
My new favourite hotel in Singapore,Marc Filion,"What a spectacular achievement - the balance of personalised service and hotel privacy is perfect, and throw in the Philippe Starck design (which is functional too!) and this is a winner.  Have stayed in most SG hotels (and hosted conferences etc) so speaking from experience. Yusuff in the lounge area was most congenial and recommended my now favourite Singapore street food spot (Zam Zam near Mosque - omg, try the deer filling...). He was a delight to speak with after a long day at the office. Staff is personal and respectful - and not rehearsed at all. Location is perfect - walking distance to Bugis, Haji, Suntec/MarinaSq/Raffles City - and my other great discovery of this trip: rep cinema The Projector just down Beach Rd.  Only one minor minor comments (hey, nothing is…",5,October 2019,
I love this hotel...!,Dalikestotravel,"Was back at the JW SB for a short staycation and still love it here. The service once again, did not fail to impress. Everyone that I happened to speak to, from Reuben at the front desk, Stella at the exec lounge, to the house keeping staff on the 14th floor and waitresses at the South beach kitchen where breakfast was served, were all very welcoming and lovely. Since I was with my 2 teens, I booked a rm with twin beds, and was very happy that the hotel was able to set up extra bedding on the sofa bed so that we could use it as an extra bed instead of paying an extra $120 for one to be purposely set up. 👍🏻 The room is very spacious, comfortable with good view.   I still don’t like the artwork in the rooms though, this time it was a modern black/white head shaped waterfall...,…",5,October 2019,
Room Tiny,neilsa,All great..food fabulous..staff can not be faulted Was not upgraded and that's understandable but the regular rooms are very very small..will probably go back to Westin. Pools have great view but awkward to use Lounge is stellar,3,October 2019,
Best JW Marriott Hotel I've stayed in!,Jiggee Jon,"A boutique JW Marriott like no other. A totally different look & feel from the usual JWMs of the world but with the same bespoke service one would expect from a JW Marriott hotel. The team on-site here are very well trained and passionate at their jobs. Hotel is located in a very ideal spot, just a mere stroll from Suntec and a stone's throw to Marina Bay Sands too. The meeting facilities here are exceptional and there's an amazing mix of colonial era settings with modern luxe where the meeting rooms sit as it's literally renovated army barracks and a clubhouse that make up the new hotel facilities. Great views during the F1 races too await you at the 18th floor. A truly comfortable stay is guaranteed here!",5,October 2019,
Great experience in Singapore!,gayle p,"We had such a great experience in the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach. It was unbelievable customer experience. From taking care of our luggage being shipped from Paris (thank goodness) and our experiences on the 18th floor pool (outstanding),  and the daily customer service personnel (Sherrine, Stella and Melvin).  We loved our stay.  The executive lounge was amazing.  While the hotel is slightly fashionably dated, and due to the location near the equator, it is a bit moldy, but the staff is amazing and makes a GREAT impression.  it is a great hotel.  Enjoy",5,October 2019,
Amazing,ella T,"Beautiful Hotel, metro, shopping center is near by.

Perhaps my best hotel experience ever,travelingin2019,"I have spent an entire week at this hotel.  The location has been perfect for my first time in Singapore.   Before I even arrived Effa had been in touch to assure my stay went well. We were celebrating a milestone birthday and the hotel made that special in a number of ways. Thank you Effa!  Our housekeeper was Sandy and she was outstanding. Thank you Sandy!  The service at this hotel is outstanding. We were attended to each and every day. Kudos to the staff and the management for their attention to detail.  I’d like to give a shout out to Mandy in the spa, where I had the most luxurious pedicure of my life. :)  I’d like to take time to recognize the folks in the Executive Lounge especially.

Highly recommended,Lara W,"We were  visiting family in Singapore and stayed for 5 nights in the hotel. The staff were brilliant from the moment we arrived, nothing was too much trouble and there was always someone available to assist. The hotel is beautifully decorated throughout. Both of the hotels swimming pools are great and were quiet throughout our stay. I particularly suggest going to see the view at night from the 18th floor. We had access to the executive lounge so ate breakfast and dinner there most days. The food available was tasty and there was a varied selection. The hotel itself is in a great location and has everything you can ever need. Would not hesistate to recommend this hotel.",5,October 2019,
Amazing Service!,HollaVeenaKris,"Truly amazing service! We always choose JW Marriott for our stay.It was a good stay! The food was excellent and the staff superb! There was a staff member who was particularly helpful, accommodating that is Jollie (JELO) (ANGELINA JOLIE) super star!! always remember us and take care of us.

One of my favorite hotels in the workd,AnnieBibble,"Obsessed with this hotel and looking for any reason to go back to Singapore to stay there. Impeccable service, great location, amazing amenities and the club level is by far the best of any hotel/franchise. I wish all the JW Marriott hotels were this level of perfection.   ",5,June 2019,
"Great Location, Excellent Service",genyit,"We recently spent 3 nights in Singapore at the Marriott South Beach. We were very impressed by the front desk and concierge staff. They were very welcoming, courteous, and responsive. We had a lovely room on the 23rd floor with a great view of the bay and CBD. The bedroom area was a bit small but the bathroom was really spacious. This was not an issue for us because we were always out and about exploring fascinating Singapore. The breakfast and dinner buffets were quite exceptional with a great variety of options for Western and Asian dining. The seafood offerings at the dinner buffet were well worth the price. We found it very easy to use cabs and/or the metro from the hotel. Raffles City Mall is directly across from the hotel.",4,September 2019,
Great Location and Exceptional Service,Chan,"Firstly, location of this hotel is superb as it is very central and connected to the MRT station.  Hotel is great with the standards and quality of JW Marriott. They have quite a number of restaurants and bars that are spread across the area namely Akira Back, Fish Pool, Madame Fan, Court Martial Bar and Tonic to name a few, which are unique and good to check out.  What is exceptional is the tireless and excellent staff that makes this hotel excellent.  Luna, Eva and Talgat are doing an excellent job in leading a team of dedicated staff that is improving (that I see from my previous stays). Luna is the new Hotel Manager and my feedback to her on my previous trip in July was immediately actioned upon and was already implemented by the time I returned in October.

Best Business Hotel Singapore 2019,Angga Awang,"Stayed here for 2 nights for business trips. All I can say is the location is superb! Nearby 3 MRT stations within walking distance. Singapore most popular conference building is right acccross the street. Malls were practically next door.   The staff were very friendly and helpful. Best staff of all mariott brands. They gave special notes in my room and a complimentary wine bottle. Executive lounge facility was the best.   The only reason why I didnt give full rating was because the room was not satisfying. I was upgraded to larger room due to my platinum status. But, the room was very standard. It feels like a regular 4 star hotels. I hope they can fix this. ",4,October 2019,
"Nice property, great location",mfheinonen,"The JW is situated in a great location, close to shops and restaurants and night life. I felt the room was a bit small for the price but hey, it’s Singapore and things can get pricey. The room was nice, not much of a view. The check in was pleasant and fast, the staff was friendly and helpful and I slept very peacefully. I’d stay here again. ",4,October 2019,
Good hotel but ......,johnvindevoxhel Vera,This week the Brazil selection is staying here since my first morning I have being told were I can and can’t go because the selection team is here... I understood the fact and was cool. But every morning when the car was about to pick me up I couldn’t wait for the car at front of the hotel because one of the team member would come. This afternoon I tried to enter thru the back entrance as it is the nearest from the mall but surprisingly three security guys didn’t give me access even though I’m a hotel guest and I had to turn out and walk thru the other entrance 300 mts away. But when at the lobby there was a closed area near elevators that we couldn’t cross when we are going to get elevators. So I questioned myself it this not a disturbance to customers for something we haven’t…,1,October 2019,
Great hotel,HeidiAS,"This hotel is absolutely great. The area around,  the surroundings and location is wonderful. The hotel itself is modern,  lots of art and design in the hotel. Rooms are nice, view is nice, two pools that can be used for great recreation. The breakfast didn't miss anything! If you're travelling to Singapore for leisure it's good to know that all the Hop on Hop off buses start and finish their lines right on the other side of the road. Also the entrance to Suntec City mall is right across the road. Just perfect!",5,October 2019,
Lovely staff at Executive lounge n Bar,Kao S,"Me and my friends were impressed of how luxurious the lounge is. Would like to thank Esther who walked us around. She is the most friendly staff we met on this trip. She will be the reason that we will visit this property in the nearest future. Nice check in from Olivia. She provided us nice and high floor room. Well recommended to visit the Fantastic swimming pool and Tonic Bar, ask for Kochi, she is the gems. Thanks ",5,October 2019,

Stunning hotel in a great spot in the city,Chris,"I'll get the bad bit out of the way first - the process of booking the room was a disaster. We were over-charged and then not refunded enough, which took weeks to resolve, and the hotel management didn't seem to understand what the problem was.  Anyway, once we actually arrived at the property, everything as great. We stayed over the F1 GP weekend, and the hotel is ideally situated for viewing and/or attending the race. One of the gates to the course is a 5 minute walk and there are good views over one of the turns from the smaller of the two swimming pool and bar areas (although, understandably, this was quite crowded all weekend!).  More generally, all the staff we met were incredibly friendly and helpful, despite the hotel being at capacity for the weekend.  We had breakfast…",5,September 2019,
Enjoyed my second stay here.,ashhtontaylor_,"This is my second stay at this property, this time in their Premier Marina Bay View Room in room #1916. Location is great, close to City Hall and Esplanade MRT Stations with nearby malls include Suntec City, Marina Square and Raffles City Shopping Centre. That weekend happened to be the 1st NDP (National Day Parade) Preview and the view from the room is unobstructed and amazing. The room is luxurious, sleek and spacious. Anyone who likes to admire themselves in the mirror - this room is for you. This time around, I manage to check out Ebb 6 outdoor pool, and although it is on a lower floor and took a bit of a walk to go over, it’s quieter but still as relaxing as the main pool: Flow18. Breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen was great, wide variety and staff is always so attentive.…",4,July 2019,

Staying at the JW Singapore,Hugh B,The JW in Singapore is on of the best Marriott I have stayed in.  I am a Marriott ambassador and have visited many properties.  This property is fantastic.  The employees that run the executive lounge are awesome. Especially Sree.  Sree always greets me with a smile and make sure that I am taken care of.  She does this for all customers.  She is amazing and a very pleasant.  The other lounge staff are as equally pleasant as Sree.  They will remember your name and make you feel at home.,5,September 2019,
Best Marriott Property!!,zTraveller,"I really like this hotel! It’s modern, super clean, rooms/suites are amazingly comfortable,  and the staff are extremely friendly and professional. If it’s your first time in Singapore, you can’t beat this location. Close to all attractions! If you are on a diet, then tough luck, plenty of food especially at the lounge where they serve breakfast, mini-lunch, and dinner with free drinks! .  Definitely give it a try, I know I can’t wait to be back!!",5,October 2019,

Best hotel I've ever stayed at,joan805,"Can I give it 15 stars? This review is a year and a few months late, but now that I finally have my account up and running, I must post it. I stayed in Singapore for a work trip and broke my shoulder at the very end of the trip. The concierge was one of the kindest people I have met and provided the hotel car to take myself and my colleague to the emergency room. I wound up staying an extra week to recover and you would have thought the staff were my very own family, they were so kind to me. Frankly, they were even more kind than my very own family. In no hotel in my life have I ever felt so taken care of! Just as an average guest, every detail was thoughtfully addressed. The maid service was exceptional. This is truly the greatest hotel I have ever stayed at and I look forward…",5,November 2018,

3pm check-in not even honored.,eric h,1) JW Marriott Singapore clearly has zero interest in helping anyone that has luggage checking into the hotel.  2) 3:05pm arrived at the hotel.  Room not ready waited for over 20 minutes.    3) The overall attitude and staff could care less about checking in.  No hey sorry your room is not ready.    4) Hotel policy states 3pm check in is in fact 3pm.  Marriott loves to throw the terms and conditions at its members but when they make a mistake THEY DO NOT OWN IT and say SORRY and try to make it right.    5) Marriott offers 24/7 my checkin which is never available to ambassador guests around the world and is a major drama that a member has to fight tooth and nail for.   6) For those staying here at the JW Marriott South Beach please be aware that 3pm does not mean 3pm.  7) I…,2,September 2019,
Excellent business accommodation,Tanya Brownrigg,"overall excellent JW!  This was my second stay and before I even arrived I received a welcome back note. The housekeeping is outstanding, picking up on my glasses and left lens cloths, replacing the chamomile tea, and leaving lovely notes.   The executive lounge is indeed one of the best I’ve stayed at and works well for meeting in town associates. The 18th flow also was great for team happy hour/ and conference calls with a view.  My only suggestion (and they’ve likely heard this) is that the fitness center is tiny compared to the number of rooms, and is really crowed all times of the day.  Thanks to the team for making me feel welcome and important to them.",5,September 2019,

Great stay,Astroph,"We flew in from the States for the Formula 1 race. As Platinum we were allowed to check-in at the lounge on the second floor. Unfortunately it took over a half an hour for the agent to find an available room due to the hotel being near capacity. Though, their service recovery was excellent. The hotel provides the Marriott Platinum member access to the lounge plus one guest. Breakfast in the lounge was plentiful. Though we had the option to take a free breakfast in the restaurant we took our breakfast both mornings in the lounge. Mid-day there was tea and appetizers. In the evening they had hot appetizers and an open bar. This was a really amazing value as it allowed us to have drinks and then head to the 6th floor balcony to catch practice, qualifying, and the race. For those…",5,September 2019,
Not your standard JW Marriott.,Boyde,"The location - is great it’s right in city centre very convenient. Front desk - Terrence was very welcoming and acknowledgement of member status. Room - horrible very ugly inside, old smelly carpet floors, very hard bed, bazaar layout. FnB - nothing special the restaurant is not in the hotel you have to walk outside to get to it. Service - I had a nightmare trying to get service from these guys, many small things that kept piling on I tried to ask to upper management but the GM is really busy so busy in fact that she isn’t even in the hotel and doesn’t care about the guest concerns at all. Overall, the location is great the price is ridiculous I haven’t tried any other hotels but they all look good and worth trying else where.",1,September 2019,

The hotel is modern, well laid out, with impeccable, friendly and professional service.  We arrived at the hotel to be greeted at the executive club counter by Sherrine, who gave us a great city orientation (its been 30 years since we last visited Singapore) and showed us on a map where several places were that we needed to visit -  she also made some great suggestions for other places to visit in between races.  The room - a Studio - was outstanding.  Incredibly well designed and a triumph of ergonomics for how much was fitted effectively and in a visually impressive fashion into a small space.

The marriott lounge breakfast is AWESOME.  Eastern and Western options, omelette stations cold cuts, fruit assortment fresh juices.  They have everything you need.    Only issue with this hotel is the wait for a Taxi.  Not sure why they haven’t solved this but give yourself 5-10 minutes each morning to wait for a taxi.

Luxurious Property with an Amazing Service-Oriented Team,Conjurer,I have always liked this luxurious property as my previous stay here have been a great one. It is very close to major shopping malls and have an MRT station just below the hotel. It has a nice decor and the air-con is strong from the moment you walk in right from the lifts and lobby.  Front Desk Check-in has been a pleasant experience as there is always a few staff there to attend to your needs if you are in the queue. Luna helped me with my check in and she does her best to offer me a room upgrade as well as explaining the breakfast operating hours. During my stay i met Gladys from the front desk every time i pass by and she remembers me by my name and made me feel very welcome and special. She also assisted me with my key card and is an asset to the hotel.   Food&Beverage…,5,September 2019,

Too many little disappointments,HCLChristine,"Stayed a night for our wedding anniversary.  Things that were off: 1. I booked the room via Booking.com and upon seeing that my request for a king bed was not reflected on my confirmation email, I tried to check with the hotel directly but could not find an email address on the entire Internet. In the end, I sent a request for confirmation via Booking.com but did not receive any response from the hotel, despite Booking.com's system-triggered email the next day to check if my matter was resolved and I had replied no and rated the service ""unsatisfactory"".   2.

Upon check in, he offered a complimentary add-on that really helped to make things sweeter, even though it really wasn’t the hotel’s fault. Outstanding, attentive service and care. Totally impressed. Breakfast the next morning was the same. The staff got my kids seats despite half our party being late.

Great experience in stay",Lukeluke84,"My check in was delayed and hence since I have lounge access, I stayed in the lounge while waiting for the rooms to be ready.  Hazel from executive lounge was amicable and her pleasant personality really ease the long waiting time.   Room was only ready at 3:45pm on a Friday afternoon. However the room wasn't what I expected and hence I decided to change to another room.  Later on at cocktail hours, she continued serving us. Nagu came alone as well, the 2 of them makes excellent cocktails for us, not forgetting Rose who was serving us at the counter. I am so thankful to have them to make the staycation so worthwhile.  My room was only ready at 7pm, and the promised transfer of luggage from my earlier room wasn't done until I reminded them.   Had a cut in the bath room, and after…",4,September 2019,
"Man, I want to give them 5 stars (Marriott Ambassador)",mabollinger,"I have always said that this is my favorite Marriott.  Great lounge, pleasant staff VERY service oriented.  I really love the folks there.  They tried very hard to honor my upgrade.  Good facilities, great lounge and located right across from SUNTEC city.  It's a really great stay.  I love the place.  And despite the next complaint , I think I might stay again.  I just wish they could get the bill right. --------------- I tried to be patient,  but ended up severally frustrated.  They needed me to pay the bill on a half stay (It was 12 days).  I understood.  Never got an email.  I asked ... they said ""Oh, when you close it out"".  I then departed...the bill was wrong,  we finally fixed before I left.  Guess what, no email.  9 days go by.  Nothing on the Marriott website.  I…",4,September 2019,
Check in Process in timely manner,Suta A,"I was staying on 13 June at Deluxe room for business trip, the first when enter to the lobby it felt welcome by the ladies around the reception, this 2 ladies was anticipating for every guest need whether the direction or toilet. my point is the service so anticipating so the guest do not need to come to them but the other way round. however on the other I felt hat lobby so small somehow. overall stay is nice, the Bar, swimming pool is good. Thank you",4,June 2019,
Good hotel,SiddharthVasudevan,This hotel will be the most quirky hotel I have come across! Not expecting that from JWM. The check in and check out were efficient.

My last stay at this property,Hnarula,"Disclosure: I am Marriott Platinum Elite Ambassador member, with over 100 nights in Marriot properties last year.  I am in Singapore very regularly and have stayed in MANY different hotels in Singapore.  Checked in for a wedding group, with a 6 day stay booked.   As you enter the hotel you are greeted by a large video wall. Interesting, but...  Enter the lobby and you see a loooong narrow alley with some seating closer to the entrance followed by the concierge desk and then the checkin desks on the right side.  Checkin was pretty slow, but as Ambassador I was soon led to the room for check-in. Some other guests told me they had to wait until 4.30pm for their room. Unacceptable in my view.  Enter the lifts, and you are greeted by these artsy lifts with lights that change colors…",3,August 2019,
Amazing Service in the Executive Lounge,John O,"Stayed 3 nights in this excellent hotel in early August.

"Good location, Minutes walk to Suntec City",m0ments_intime,"The room was big at 100sqm but the bed size was kinda pathetic to just only be a queen size bed. Huge bathrooms and living area. Fridge was in a hidden cupboard, very sleek and classy look for the whole suite. Service was great as well, even just by taking the elevator together with the staff, we will be greeted by them. Best place to be if you're having a conference at Suntec City due to the proximity. However the lights in the room can be quite dim, making it hard to work at night due to all the warm lighting.",3,August 2019,
Art all around,CalorieShmalorie,"Just a short two night stay and it was all good. The hotel is beautifully designed, elegant, brimming with art. The room is nice, has everything the guest would need. The bathroom is perfect.  One thing I would change about the room are the ceiling to floor thin metal blinds which cannot be raised to get an unobstructed view. The breakfast buffet is good, the staff very attentive. Check in seemed a bit slow, but there were a lot of interesting things to see at the lobby to keep guests occupied. Check out process is faster. Had a great stay!",5,August 2019,

Wedding Ceremony,Rongroth Sachathep,"My nephew had booked the J.W Marriot hotel for his wedding ceremony. Rooms rates were pretty much in the high side but this being Singapore, we really did not have much choice, also the location was a plus point. Sad to say , though, was the check in procedure and the behavior of the check in and check out counter staff. The brand Marriot conjures up good and warm hospitality which was sadly lacking in this property, Most  of the foreign guests who arrived in Singapore from various neighboring countries , including us, got our room key after 16.30 pm - 17.00 pm, that also after repeatedly having to wait for the staff to confirm us that the rooms allocated was ready for us. The staff were pretty robotic in their check in service with none of the smile or hospitality accorded to…",4,August 2019,
great hotel and location,newlifechapters,Enjoyed our stay at the JW.  Very nice hotel- we were upgraded to a suite which was lovely.  Friendly staff- except for one of the concierge who acted as though we were bothering her when asking about bus passes- giving minimal info and generally not helpful- odd for a concierge.  The housekeepers were great- no waiting for your room to be cleaned- it was done by the time got back from breakfast!  The executive lounge staff was great- particularly Hazel and the lady at the soup and omelette station in the morning (I regret I can't remember her name).  They have 2 pools- we only used the infinity pool on the 18th floor which had great view of the city. Enjoyed our stay,5,September 2019,
Great Service,Peter Fong,"I picked JW to attend a conference that was being held there.   Check in was OK and polite. No drink or refreshment was offered. The receptionist promised to find out if my membership was still valid and where the conference would be held, but all I received was a welcome card later in the day.  The hotel lobby was narrow and somewhat dark, and the lifts well, were also dark and colourful - didn't bother me but I guess it might not be to everyone's taste.   The room was smallish but well provided with everything one needs. I found it odd that a JW did not provide an individual coffee making machine - some 4 stars already  do this. The additional of a bath tub in such small space was nice. Toiletries were by Aromatherapy Associates. The mattress was a bit firm but I slept well. …",5,September 2019,

It is about 20 mins from Changi Airport and costs about S$30 in taxi. The metro station is just few steps away from the hotel, providing easy access to the all the tourist attractions.  The rooms had all the essential amenities and the bed was comfortable too. The buffet breakfast was a generous spread with Chinese, Malay, and Indian staples. We loved the offerings at the executive lounge also. They have two restaurants on site but we were not able to try those. We loved the Tonic bar, their gin drinks were really refreshing in the hot and humid Singapore weather.

Popular hotel for local staycations,Davidlye70,This hotel seems very popular with travellers and locals alike. I was lucky to get 1pm check in. Upgrade to suite courtesy of Bonvoy Gold occurred rather quickly at 3pm.  The deluxe bedroom is small and nothing much to write home about. It is worth paying slightly more (~$100) to get a junior suite. The wrong welcome snack was sent to my room. I was a bit worried that it may be leftover by the last guest!  The club lounge is great. Excellent afternoon tea and dinner. You can certainly eat your dinner from 530-730pm. No champagne but proseco. Michael Lynch was the best red served. Access to club lounge does not give you breakfast in the hotel breakfast restaurant which is not a bad thing as long queue for the buffet breakfast. The breakfast served in the club lounge was decent…,4,August 2019,

"Great breakfast, design and location!",barbarabaro,"The hotel has a great location to visit Singapore by foot, and amazing views of the city from the pool.  The design is modern and elegant, and the facilities are luxurious, including an amazing spa. The massage lady was amazing, she fixed my back pain after a long flight and recommended great products.   The breakfast has a huge variety of great quality food, western and Asian. I loved it!   The pool has great views as I mentioned, and great cocktails, the only downside is that they don’t have pool beds at all, and the water is quite cold. It’s not a hotel to enjoy the pool, it’s more to rest and have breakfast only. But you can still get a refreshing swim with a view.  I definitely recommend it!",5,August 2019,
funky design driven hotel,jayc2007,i expect conservative decor when i stay at a marriott.  this place breaks the mold.  it goes out of its way to be hip.  the service is up to par with the marriott chain which is to say almost perfect.  the room was very nice although the use of mirrors was overdone.  it makes getting around a bit difficult when one hasn't quite woken up completely.  the bed was excellent as we kept oversleeping.  the staff at the executive lounge are attentive and well versed on their wines and drinks.  the food selection is impressive.  the red wines though were disappointing.  i stuck with the white wines.  if i had to complain about anything it is how the staff at the lounge seem to be campaigning to be written up in tripadvisor.  i won't encourage them except to say that they were all very…,5,August 2019,

World Class Hotel,DrMAJones,"We came to JW Marriott South Beach after staying 3 days at MBS. Although we’d had a memorable experience, MBS is not a luxury hotel and is a bit chaotic. Every aspect of our stay has been stellar at JW. From the check in experience and concierge services to fluffy robes and slippers, we have enjoyed the food, 24 hour room service, club lounge, infinity pool, and our room. I was especially pleased with the Toto Washlet toilet and the deep tub in the bathroom. Staff are very attentive and genuinely help you and offer “from the heart” services. I’d like to extend a special thank you to Hazel in the Club Lounge and Gladys at the front desk. The world would be great if all Marriott’s offered this level of service. The Concierge service was also wonderful.",5,August 2019,

Overall I cannot fault the hotel. The room was lovely, the bed was extremely comfortable, even the roll out bed for my sister was comfortable. The bathroom was lovely and spacious.

Housekeeping was a little stingy with refilling our teabags and coffee capsules, but as soon as you call, they were by your door in no time.

Top recommendation for Singapore,Mambo2003,"It was a good decision to select JW Marriott South Beach for a few days of family vacation in Singapore. Location is great, just across the street from the recently renovated Raffles Hotel and close to Suntec. This is a design hotel with a modern vibe, a lot of art and interesting highlights. Very professional staff, spacious room, comfortable beds and good amenities. We liked the integration of traditional heritage buildings into the complex. Executive lodge was excellent, very capable and nice staff and a special mention for Hazel who makes customers feel very welcome. The 2 pools look great but could be a bit warmer and we also missed some sun loungers for more relaxing hours by the pool. Would chose JW Marriott again for business and pleasure.",4,August 2019,
Great,Dr. Vorravee,"One thing we appreciate most about our favorite hotels is their ability to distill the best of their destination within their luxury walls, while also keeping boundaries fluid and helping us deep-dive into the city. Checking into JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, it was clear we were in just such an evolved urban hotel, a place that could open our eyes in many directions at once. In fact, you might say that this brilliantly fused complex of heritage buildings and hotel towers is Singapore incarnate. We love the senses of peace and of place you get from a good walk. And one reason we booked here was that it’s only a few blocks to so many wonderful cultural attractions, from the National Gallery to St. Andrew’s Cathedral to the Singapore Art and the Asian Civilisations Museums.…",5,April 2019,

We did the Marina Bay Sands thing when we first arrived in Singapore and then transitioned over to the JW and were not dissapointed.  As a Marriott elite we were escorted quickly to the Concierge Lounge where we were able to sit and enjoy a quick drink and snacks while the team checked us in.  Unfortunately when we checked in Opera the reservation system was being rebooted and the team couldn't have been more apologetic, they did as much as they could as soon as it was up they began looking for an upgraded room and while it wasn't ready right away they didn't disappoint.  we were able…",5,July 2019,
one of the best,Joanna_vigate,"this premises/property comes with great history, and thanks to the tour (thanks Erica) we learnt a lot more. comfortable and well designed, the deluxe suite was ours to enjoy for 4 nights!  peak satisfaction with every visit to the kitchen and lounge!",5,August 2019,
Beautiful hotel with pleasant staff,VacationManiac85,"Hotel is beautiful.  Rooms are not large but they are comfortable.  Hotel offers great amenities.  Infinity pool is beautiful, we took a bottle of wine up there and enjoyed a relaxing night and a wonderful view. Staff are pleasant and very helpful.  Convenient access to the efficient SMRT (mass transit), very easy to understand and get around.  Walking distance to Merlion (15-20 mins), Marina Bay (30-35 mins). ",5,August 2019,
Great staff & location,renegade150,"A special shout out to Miss Deborah and her excellent team for helping me with all my requests. The whole JW experience was smooth, from the very first phone call to the front desk to the warm welcoming smiles of the bell boys. The staff approach you first before you need to ask or even hint for assistance. Do check out the pool on the 18th floor for some of the best views of the city, or just for a drink!",5,August 2019,
Designed hotel!!,Lum,We spent 3 nights here. The suite was big and beautiful. Both exterior and interior designs were great. The functional design in our room was excellent. The services were not clinical but professional. The price wasn’t cheap. The amenities were great. Breakfast was very good. The room cleaning was notable. Location is a bit off the main action but Singapore is small so no issues here. It’s right on the opposite of Raffles hotel.  I probably would go back to this hotel.,4,August 2019,
Checked in later than stated time.,Fengww,"Expensive but worth it, however no free breakfast. Booked premium marina view room, beautiful  hotel in CBD area. Caught the Singapore national day preview with firework from our rooms. It's just mrt by mrt station. ",4,August 2019,
Great turn-around to resolve issues,Cyrusallen,"No matter how great a brand is, service failures is part of any business. I think what seperates the professionals from amatures is their ability to turn the situtation around and use the shortcomings as a way to create a stronger relationship with the customer. I like to thank, Mr. Stephan the F&B GM and Ms. Eva from guest relations, Ann Margaret and all the team members at the exec lounge and beach rd. Cafe for quickly resloving my initial issue and go beyond their professional duties to create a long lasting impression.  Also, my wife is thankful for all the arrangements regatding her special diet.  We will return shortly.",5,August 2019,
You get what you pay for,Martin C,"It’s expensive and a nice experience. I’ve been staying here a few times, however it has not been my own choice. The roof-top is spectacular with a beautiful swimming pool, pleasant sitting areas and a gym that is too small for a hotel of this standard. The breakfast is one of the hotels strengths. The service-minded staff another. The rooms are nice but no longer new.",4,August 2019,
Great Staycation,Jim,Warm welcome upon my arrival bybthe front desk staff. Spend a relaxing time at the infinity pool. The executive lounge was exception. Good variety of food and drinks. Excellent service from the executive lounge staff especially Hazel who was warm and helpful. Though only a short stay it was a excellent home away from home.,5,August 2019,
My Favourite Hotel In Singapore,Gerald L,"This has got to be my favourite hotel in Singapore.   As a Marriott elite member I find that the hotel takes care of you very well. Staff are well spoken and friendly and they have various checks around the hotel to ensure that you are well taken care of.  I had worked the Friday in the lounge and I find that the food is well stocked as well as drinks /coffee / scones throughout the day.   I had used the spa and it’s equipped with one of my favourite brands : Aromatherapy Associates which smells heavenly. The service at the spa is very luxe and everything from the rest area, cold towels and the hospitality.  If you are coming with friends you have an amazing 2 pools, a Table Tennis Table and a pool table for your social engagements. There is also a very decent sized gym.  My…",5,August 2019,
Disappointing Room,Abby Wu,"I booked a deluxe room and expected a spacious 35 sqm room based on the pictures on the website, but when I came in last night I was quite disappointed with our room. It felt much smaller than depicted on their website and I felt like half of the room was allocated to the bathroom. To add to that, I wasn’t happy with the duvet, they’re not quite smooth and was stiff and starchy. Overall quite disappointed,  I don’t feel like it lives up to the JW Marriott brand and doesn’t compare to the other JW Marriott hotels I’ve stayed at in other countries.",3,August 2019,
Outstanding service & memorable birthday,Marlyn Z,"Recently I spent a week at the JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore. After a hectic work week, the staff at the executive lounge and the concierge helped me plan 2 days of fabulous tourism. Although the hotel was filled to capacity with ""stay-cation"" weekend visitors, Rose, Bella, Jacquelyn, Hazel, Crystal (intern/trainee) and Nelson made me feel special. The lovely fruit and cheese, chocolate covered strawberries, and sparkling wine for my birthday made the experience memorable. On my next trip to Singapore, I plan to stay at the JW Marriott.

one night business trip in Singapore,restinpeace01,Stayed one night in this modern and brand new hotel in the center of Singapore. The room is giving full satisfaction at the level of my expectation. The breakfast choice is outstanding. a special thank for the fast check out there and the professional team.,5,July 2019,
Good hotel,RMJK,"I stayed at the JWM Singapore for 3 nights during a recent business visit.   Like all SG hotels in that area, the Marriott is in a good location with a big shopping mall just directly across the hotel. The Hotel also has several eating and drinking options right below. The check in was a bit slow as it tends to get crowded. The room size is not very big. I was actually bit surprised as the size was much smaller than say a Ritz Carlton SG and very little room to move around. However what made the stay brilliant was the room service and the house keeping. They did those tiny little things (like leaving a lens cleaner in the room!) that made the stay extra special and very homely. The room has huge windows that allow sunlight to enter. Like the room, the bathroom was also slightly…",4,March 2019,
Executive Lounge staycation,Alan Leong,"My second visit to the JW Marriot Singapore.   My last stay was in January 2019 for just 2 days. Yet Jacquelyn, Hazel & Jollie recognised me and provided an excellent service of personal care.... during my staycation to view the National Day celebration dress rehearsals.   Special thanks to the Executive Lounge Team.  Despite my Bonvoy Plat Elite status; they were not able to upgrade me; as the hotel was packed for the ND parade. Hopefully next time.   Alan Leong Singapore  TripAdvisor Level 6 ",5,July 2019,
Faulty fire alarm system,SJtravels,"I had a poor experience here while on business. The hotel has a faulty fire alarm system which went off several times overnight on two separate nights. The only compensation offered was free laundry. The staff appear newly trained and are very ""in your face"" from the moment you enter the lobby. They could improve by relaxing a little and having greater respect for peoples privacy and space.",2,July 2019,

Another great stay at JW Marriott,Brian A,"Really enjoyed Nother stay here t the JW Marriott. We stayed here for about a week this stay and really enjoyed the hospitality.  As a frequent traveler I was able to use the executive lounge to check in where Noel and Brandon did a great job. From there my room was not ready, so I was able to relax in the lounge and snack on some light food and included alcohol drinks.  The complimentary breakfast at Beach Road Kitchen was amazing, lots of options. Really appreciate the host Hazel remembering us after a few days.  We typically like to use the executive lounge in the afternoon and night time, so I would like to thank Crystal, Nur, Hazel, Bella, and Melvin.  My favorite part of coming to the hotel is the friendliness of the staff, very accommodating and been able to get to know…",5,July 2019,
Accidental Fire Alarms Blaring During the Night !!,Pwet,"Great hotel, but who wants to be woken up on consecutive nights by false fire alarms blaring into the rooms at 12.30am? We got such a fright we stayed awake for hours each night afterwards.  Hopeless if you have to go to work.  I can’t believe it wasn’t fixed after going off twice the first night.  We moved out.  Other than that the Executive Lounge is terrific.  ",3,July 2019,
Thank you Marriot !,Ryan F,"I would highly recommend staying at a club lounge room, a big thank you to staff in the club lounge Jessie,Crystal,Farrah,Melvin,Stella and chef Alan for looking after us great service and done with a smile , thank you from Ryan, Sophia and Christian",5,July 2019,
Fabulous!!!,John B,"Fabulous Place  I had the chance to be in this place over the weekend. Great place with all the first world amenities, the well stocked bar, the great cityscape and skyline as you lounge at the pool in one of the upper floors and its great location near the Bay Gardens.  More than these are the very accommodating and gracious staff. Ms Hazel at the Executive Lounge is one of the best, going out of her way to tour us around the spacious and classy property.  One of the best in Singapore!",5,July 2019,
JW-Wow Singapore!,4EverWanderluster,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach as part of my 40th birthday celebrations.  As Titanium Elite members, we were warmly greeted upon arrival and escorted to their AMAZING executive lounge where we completed our check-in and then invited to have breakfast and enjoy complimentary spa services while our room was prepared.   The location of this hotel is in the heart of the Central Business District (CBD) and is conveniently located within walking distance of several major attractions and the Esplanade MRT (subway) station.  The room was spacious, clean and very modern and we absolutely loved the decor as well.  The rooftop infiniti pool was stunning as well!!!

An Amazing Hotel in an Amazing Location,Fishers_from_VA,"Speaking as a Lifetime Marriott Bonvoy Titanium Elite member, I believe this hotel is one of the finest properties in the world.  It has all the amenities you could wish for, the rooms are well above average, the location in Singapore is superb, and the service is absolutely stellar in all areas.  Hazel, Jaquelyn, Jollie, and Melvin made the restaurant and concierge lounge an outright pleasure to visit, and Nino cooked the food to perfection every.single.time. There really wasn't any reason to eat anywhere else.  And when it came to keeping the Suite spotless, I don't recall ever encountering a better room attendant than Lina.  Cleaning up after people is a tough job.  Try it some time.  Lina did it perfectly to a fault, all the time smiling like it was the best job in the…",5,June 2019,
Loved this JW!,OwletteKitty,"Excellent location to everything. The food in the exec lounge and the restaurants was awesome! Better than that though was the staff. Farrah was consistently helping her colleagues no matter what they needed. Melvin has a vibrant and outstanding personality that is fun, delightful, and contagious! Thanesh was great as well!  Thank you for an awesome visit at the end of May/beginning of June! We will definitely be back to visit again at some point in the future!   Of note, this hotel has an outstanding infinity pool, gym, and lounge area on the 18th floor in an open air set up. A must see!!!",5,June 2019,
UNFORGETTABLE STAY,Valerie A. Yan,"We came from our wedding celebration at Marriott Manila and flew to Singapore J.W. Marriott for a six-day vacation from July 8-13.  Arriving at the Executive Lounge of J.W. Marriott, we were immediately welcomed, assisted, and pampered by an amazing team!    It was just in time for afternoon tea so we spent it at the Lounge.  From the onset we felt so relaxed!   Our room was luxurious, expansive, and had an INCREDIBLE VIEW OF SINGAPORE!   The service we experienced from the Executive Lounge team - Nur, Hazel, Melvin, Farrah, and our room attendant Ju Qing - was OUTSTANDING.  They were a big part of what made our stay UNFORGETTABLE.  Nur sent us champagne, cake, fine chocolates and even colorful balloons! There's no warmer welcome than what we receive daily from Hazel, Melvin,…",5,July 2019,
AMAZING HOTEL AND SERVICE STAFF!!,william1234,"The entire hotel staff, and especially the Executive Lounge staff were extremely friendly and polite. Jollie in the excutive lounge never forget to smile when we enter the lounge.

Rooms are neat, modern, clean and spacious. I would really recommend this to my friends.",5,July 2019,
Not sure if this is a JW,Ed Rosenstein,"Style over substance kind of hotel.  Rooms cramped. Pool is tiny, location despite being central isn’t great. Room layout is possibly the worst I’ve seen. Despite being upgraded it felt the bathroom was larger than the rest of the room.   Staff seem aloof and disinterested in helping guests. I guess the fault lies with the management for not bothering to be part of the team. I was here for three nights and didn’t see management got lounge access through my elite status but wouldn’t bother to visit there crowded cafeteria like club lounge. Let alone pay for it.   Overpriced ($460 + tax etc) rooms that despite a few years old are starting to look worn out.   We were due back to come and stay here on our way back to NYC but I’ve opted for the Ritz-Carlton instead.   After not…",2,July 2019,
Chic Singapore Option,CtotheG,"This was my second stay at the JW Singapore- the highlights include the very modern design, super comfortable rooms, excellent executive lounge facility with great variety, nice service, as well as very skilled spa staff. Don't miss the gorgeous skyline view at night from the pool area! The big negative for us was really check-in/check-out. Upon arrival, the bellman brought us and our bag to the check-in area and asked us to sit on some benches saying ""someone would be right with us""- well after waiting for a number of minutes (and feeling like we'd been banished like naughty school kids), and watching staff walk past us without making eye contact or ask if we'd been helped, I finally asked the next passing staff member if they'd be willing to finalize our check in- it was clear…",4,June 2019,
Perfect place to stay in Singapore,Dora Lincoln,"Our family of 4 stayed for a couple of nights at JW Marriott.  Great location, amazing service.  We had a family suite and it was just superb.

Best service in Singapore - bar none,Eric P,"I travel a lot, and the courteousness of the staff here - particularly in the lounge - merits mention and praise. I have stayed here and most of the the other top hotels in Singapore, and the staff is near perfect, every single interaction. It is a combination of training, hiring, and just plain good all around people. I don't leave many 5 star reviews and I wish I could leave 6 for this staff. Kudos to the entire team.  I highly recommend staying here over any other property in Singapore, especially is you are Marriott Platinum.",5,July 2019,
Cool modern hotel,krhoben,Beautiful hotel in a great location downtown close to all the tourist attractions- modern rooms- comfortable beds- really cool pools with a spa like vibe overlooking the city but they were cold and no place to lie in the sun. Nice club room and wonderful buffet breakfast.,5,July 2019,
Danger lingers,hklimflo,"I celebrated my birthday with a buffet lunch,attended by 9 family members and 7 friends.  The buffet spread was plentiful with many local and western dishes, complete array of desserts. We were pretty impressed by the many cold items featured in their Cold Room.  Hot coffee n tea were also provided.  Unfortunately, my wife fell after returning from the toilet due to slippery floor after a downpour.  I had highlighted this danger of severe injury to patrons  to the management who had acknowledge this. They had undertaken to immediately remedy this danger so I hope that no other persons need to suffer the pain from fall and trauma of moving around during rainy days.  Undoubtedly the service plus the food surpasses many restaurants but protecting patrons from injury is paramount.",3,June 2019,

Careful no flexibility on cancellation policy,SkiBiz,"I wanted to cancel last minute and even though the hotel was completely full, they didn't show any flexibility, and they probably sold my room many times over.

Strange hotel - Atypical of a JW,amit,"Stayed here for a night in April this year.    This hotel has a narrow isle that has both its lobby and reception area.  It also has the concierge and bell desk.  As you can imagine the place is full of people and at times chaotic.  Check in was a task - long wait given the limited staff consequent to the small space.    The room is again weird.  Longish isle to a smallish room.  Tight space for a double bed, TV desk under it mini bar and a small rocking chair.  The bathroom was probably as large as the room and had a funky toilet - automatic and remote controlled.    I ordered room service soon upon check in - First the food took 30 mins to come and arrived cold.  I ordered plain omelette and toast.  Toast was effectively plain cold bread.  Second they forgot to send cutlery so…",2,April 2019,

Unequivocally Exceptional,R170171,It is rare to find a hotel that goes above and beyond to preempt a guests needs . This hotel is so professionally managed your stay will be faultless .  The rooms provide a cutting edge ambiance that shine above the norm and offer a refreshing respite from the standard cookie cutter predictable hotel rooms.  The location at South Beach is perfect with immediate access to all that Singapore offers but remains at arms length from shopping malls which allows a calming and resort like atmosphere.  As a Bonvoy Titanium member I experienced the Executive lounge which exudes an abundance  of hospitality.  The F&B outlets are superb specifically Tonic just off the foyer .

I arrived very early in the morning but the staff was able to accommodate with no charge. I had access to the Club Lounge and there is an amazing selection and the team working that Club Lounge deserve many kudos. Hazel in particular was someone that just shined and heard many people comment the same around me. It's hard to find that level of customer service and care these days. Additionally, the amenities in hotel are all very nice. I was a bit disappointed with the sun pool as limited sun to bathe but it was still a beautiful space and the 18th floor has 360 views.

As a huge fan of Marriott and its high end brands I have stayed over 1,100 nights but can only think of a few times where I have encountered this level of service. My daughter and I were treated like royalty. It seemed like the entire staff knew who we were!

Fabulous Hotel in Convenient Location,nznorm,"This was my first time staying at the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach. I usually stay at the Marriott on Orchard Road, but this hotel is in a completely different class. I checked in and was upgraded to a beautiful room on the 20th floor. The view of the city was excellent.  The location of the hotel could not be better.  Just steps away from Singapore's world-class Esplanade Performing Arts Centre, it is also close to Marina Bay and all of the amenities of that area.  The room, while not large, was beautifully decorated and efficiently fitted out. The refrigerator/minibar is a pull-out drawer and mirrors give the room a larger feel.

Excellent location and service,Paritosh G,"Great place to stay in. The location is close to city attractions. Rooms are nice, and service excellent. Food options are a little limited, especially if you're vegetarian. However, the chef was nice enough to whip up some dishes on request. Worth a stay, despite being a tad expensive",5,June 2019,
FANTASTIC HOTEL AND ANAZING STAFF SERVICE,Traveltrip,"Thank you to the executive lounge for taking good care of me and my boyfriend. Special mention to Jaquelyn, Melvin and Jollie.

Executive Lounge,OnAir256776,"We had an especially great time in the Executive Lounge at the JW Marriott where we were welcomed by Hazel.

Family Vacation,Darrell D,We had a wonderful time and especially enjoyed our waitress Hazel in the Executive Lounge. Her infectious smile and friendly attitude was very welcoming. We look forward to returning sometime in the near future.,5,June 2019,
Perfect Location,Lucy9908,"In the heart of the city surrounded by many restuarants,foodcourts,shopping its the place to be with the Esplanade just below the JW Marriott South Bridge 2 stops to Dhoby Ghaut and you are in Orchard another happening place you can go anyway by mrt in a jiffy just change to other lines. I celebrated my birthday here and received a small cake,chocolates & balloons courtesy of the Marriott, a nice experience. Staff was nice and checkin was efficient. The Executive Lounge has a nice selection of sandwiches,cakes & fruits if you are feeling hungry at tea time. All in all a wonderful stay thank you to the Staff of JW Marriott",4,June 2019,
And A Big Fat WOW!,Zane C,"What can one say? Sheesh, this place is exceptional. Stayed in a Premier Marina View Suite for two nights - 100m2 of pure style! Sensational service from start to finish, room immaculately clean, beautiful bathrooms and toiletries and the fitness centre? Just brilliant!  We had Club Lounge access and this was fantastic with a huge selection of food, drinks and nibbles available.  I have stayed at several hotels in Singapore over a 30 year period and I was very keen to stay at the So Sofitel again but really pleased we stayed here.  My only two negative comments would be that the sofas and chairs in the Suite's lounge area looked to be of sheer quality but they are undeniably uncomfortable - a real result of form over function and the second? Well, two nights in your beautiful…",5,June 2019,
Perfect!!!  Our Go-To Singapore Hotel!!,calizona1976,"Where to start when you review a JW Marriott?? The service, the ambience, the food, the staff, the rooms, the location ??    Location?? Incredible location with amazing views of the city.  They really maximized everything about this spot.  The 18th floor pool, spa, lounge areas, game spot and bar really hit the spot.  The views from the top are awesome.    Service?? Staff?? The staff is beyond helpful, warm, greeting. They go out of their way to say hi, ask if everything is well, bring things as you need them....overly accommodating in every way.  Reuben at the front desk was especially helpful the night we checked in.  Everyone seemed to remember us and our names as we came & went thru the lobby.  It was refreshing to feel so personal with the staff here.  Food?  There are…",5,June 2019,
Beautiful hotel with amazing service,MissTTC,"I had a lovely stay at JW from the moment I arrived until I departed. The check in experience was great as Johnny was engaging while helping me get the room that suited my preference, which I really appreciated.   The whole stay experience was nothing less than amazing. The club Team was so helpful and welcoming. They always checked on me to ensure I was comfortable. A big thank you to Noel, Melvin and Jaqueline for looking after me and making my stay as enjoyable as possible.   The breakfast spread was wonderful and I was spoilt of choice. I love the fact that they have many options that cater for different dietary requirements and the healthy freshly squeezed juices are available to add good source of vitamin to your breakfast.   Thank you for a lovely stay. I will definitely…",5,April 2019,

Nice hotel but not a good business hotel compared to others nearby,ExpatTravelFoodie,"Have stayed at many different hotels in Singapore.  While the JW Marriott is a nice hotel, I don't find it lives up to the ""JW Marriott"" brand standard.  I personally would place it as a Marriott Brand not one of their premium brands.  Location:  great.  across from Suntec City and walking distance to Marina Square.  Convenient to the PIE and ECP roadways.  Check-in:  easy.  The lobby was busy and the staff escorted me to the Executive Lounge to check in (access avail for Plat and Titanium members I assume).  Rooms:  On the small side.  For a premium positioned hotel, the rooms are much smaller than I expected, although the bathroom is decent size (more later).  I was told I has an upgraded room, so not sure if other rooms are even smaller.  The desk is a built-in against the…",3,June 2019,
Prime location,David M,"We had a great time in Singapore and enjoyed returning each night to the Marriott South Beach.  The room, though a bit small for two people, was comfortable and well appointed.  The staff, especially at the lobby desk and in the executive lounge, were friendly and accommodating.  In particular, Hazel- in the executive lounge- is a rock star!  A couple of suggestions:  convert the electrical receptacles to the universal type so that travelers don’t have to use adapters, and add a receptacle in the bathroom for hair driers, etc.",5,June 2019,
Great Choice in Singapore,TheTravler6,"We just completed a three night stay at this property. I used suite upgrades and got a corner suite along with two standard king rooms (6 people total). Rooms were very good ~ clean, comfortable, well appointed. Staff was excellent from check in through housekeeping and especially the executive lounge team (Hazel is wonderful). Location is key with access to one MRT station at the hotel, and another just a short underground walk (cool AC) away. Pool and bar area on 18th floor are nice and a good place to relax and watch the city. No doubt we would book this property again.",5,June 2019,
Best Hotel & Fantastic Staff,Kelvin1710,"My wife and I was celebrating our 19th Wedding Anniversary on one night stay at the best hotel in Singapore. The check-in was like a breeze, we were attended by two very friendly staffs, Eden and Johnny.   We were given the highest floor with panoramic view. The most memorable part was the room was well decorated with balloons and congratulatory messages written on the mirror by the Guest Relation Sarah. The bed was also decorated with two handmade towel Swans and a greeting cards with best wishes. I was surprised to receive a complimentary cake and a bottle of sparkling wine.   Rachel from AYS called and check on us if everything were okay. If we need anything, feel free to contact her directly.

Superb!,wuleonardo,"My wife and I had celebrated our 30th anniversary and our cruise ended in Singapore. We stayed for a few nights at this marvelous hotel. The staffs were great but Adrian from the front desk stands out. He went out of his way to accommodate us in using a   computer for emergency as my cellphone needs charging, because of time zone difference I had to reach someone before the office close. The hotel location was awesome with an easy access to subway and street foods. It was truly an amazing trip. Again, Kudos to Adrian for a job well done. Willy and Genie",5,May 2019,

Amazing!,FreqTraveler831,"This hotel is amazing and offers great rooms, restaurants and the location in the marina area is perfect for visiting the surrounding attractions.

Firstly, when we set foot into the hotel, we were greeted by a friendly ambassador Luna. She greeted us and aid us to check into our room really quickly.

Excellent location for a JW brand but service could be better,TravelingYogi,"I have visited multiple JW properties in Asia and the US, this JW property in Singapore is one that did not let me down in terms of room quality.   The executive lounge was also well maintained and the service was impressive.   One thing that can be improved is related to a request on upgrade. As a Platinum Elite member, I decided to use my points to redeem two nights of a standard room with two beds. Before I check in on 27th, I had called the hotel to ask if I can put in an upgrade request, so if there is availability, I’d like to be upgraded to a better room. When I made this request, I was not informed that this upgrade will result in an additional charge.   When I check in, I was delighted to hear that an upgrade was available. I was assigned a club room. Again, during…",4,May 2019,
Fabulous Hotel in a great positiom,Diane D,This hotel has everything you expect from a JW Marriott hotel. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms an ultra modern design. We are staying in 1717 and have beautiful views from our room. The bathroom has a huge bathtub and the toilet a heated toilet seat etc.  The infinity pool is amazing and has the best views. The hotel also is in a great location to a lot of the tourist attractions. As Marriott Elite Titanium members we have free access to the executive lounge. It serves a good range of delicious food and drinks. We will definitely stay again when we next visit Singapore.,5,June 2019,
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!,tamarabudiman,"Wow. This place is amazing. From the moment you enter the lobby, the entire experience is wonderful. The rooms are gorgeous, open spaces (ours came with a big bath tub). Breakfast has a million choices and goes until 11am. The gym is pretty good as far as hotel gyms go. Bed is super comfy. Great team, great breakfast, nice location, we really enjoy our time here.  I would like to highlight especially for Diana, Fiona at Beach Road Kitchen. And Martin at GRO.   Will come back for sure the same time next year and definitely recommend to my friends and family.",5,June 2019,
Nice Hotel but Service Could be Better,Firefox008,"The hotel is well located and facilities, room and amenities is what you would expect from JW Marriot. The view from the pool is stunning. Was somewhat surprised though that there wasn’t anyone manning the concierge desk at 730am when I wanted to leave my luggage to go for breakfast upon checking out.   Otherwise, I am delighted to recommend it and will come back again next time I am on a business trip.",4,June 2019,
Excellent hotel with outstanding service,HThrower,"This is my second visit to the JW Marriott South Beach. Luckily my husband is a Platinum Elite member so we were luckily upgraded to a Deluxe Suite with a view of the Marina. A huge thanks to Eva and to Adrian who I suspect had a hand in that due to it being our 25th wedding anniversary. The room was spectacular, a mini apartment really. Breakfast was served either in the Executive lounge or the Beach Road Kitchen, which is where we ate. It always offers a wide variety of options from cold cuts of meat and fish, fruits, granolas, traditional English/American breakfast and Indian and Asian dishes too! The Executive Lounge is one of the best I’ve been in and I’ve been in a lot!! It was lovely that Hazel recognised me from my last visit. She is charming and will do whatever she…",5,June 2019,
A Wonderful Stay,MsSG,We stayed for few nights at the executive suite. The views of the bay were astounding. Housekeeping on the 2nd day could have been better as in more thorough. There was a long queue for breakfast during the weekend but on weekdays it was not so busy. Breakfast was great with a big selection of food. The executive lounge is specious and one of the staffs (Farrah) was very friendly to make it an enjoyable experience.,5,June 2019,
Perfect Hotel!,MVIRGO1968,"So glad I chose this hotel as it was perfectly located  to everything!  The hotel itself is ultra modern with lots of beautiful modern arts and decor. If you're into this kind of thing, you'll appreciate them.  Check in was smooth, though their computer system was down, so they had to manually write down everything on the registration form.  We had a Club Room with full access to the Executive Lounge which was totally worth it. I recommend to always go for a room that has access to this lounge as you get to have breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails & canapes inclusive of your room rate! And the quality of food on offer is quite good which we really enjoyed. The lounge staff membere are extremely helpful and friendly. Special mention goes to Farrah and Hazel who always…",5,June 2019,
A Superb Stay,Tom_M71,"I stayed here for one night only and everything was great.   I checked in via the APP and requested a very early check in which they were able to provide, along with upgrading my room.    Each of the staff members from bell boys to front desk to concierge to exec lounge were super friendly.  I used the spa and again, highly recommended.    There is an outdoor pool on 18th floor which has an amazing view.   Location is great with the subway station next door, lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.    When I return to Singapore, for sure I will stay at JW South Beach again.  ",5,June 2019,
"Best Hotel in Singapore, at least for myself",A.L.,"For the second time, I stayed at this hotel and it still offers the same great rooms and service as before.  Centrally located in Singapore, it was my premier choice for my starting point for a cruise.  The metro is in the underground, the hop off and hop off buses are directly across the street and so are several shopping malls.   The room I was upgraded to, was amazing and offered a wonderful view of the Marina Sands Bay Hotel, so why stay there when you can have a much better Hotel.  Johnny at the front desk was a great help when we checked in.  The club lounge offered the same great amenities and a great breakfast.  The buffet dining room was a great place to have dinner.

Maya from housekeeping team also did a good job as well as the other housekeeping staffs who work tirelessly on level 9. They kept the room clean and tidy.  They surprised us by giving us a cake to celebrate our special day. We checked out with a thankful heart and will strongly recommend JW Marriott hotel to everyone who wants a staycation.

Very comfortable bed and good size room. Lot of advanced technology as part of room service. Overall had a great stay !!,5,April 2019,
It’s NOT worth it....,coloring.mylife,"It was definitely NOT qualified to be a 5-star hotel.  My first impression was good before I entered my room.   The room looked so messy and it wasn’t made up well. Also smell made me uncomfortable and the atmosphere in the room was humid and hot. Additionally I found some paper bags on the table. When I opened a drawer, it was a complete mess. This room was NOT totally ready. The worst thing was that I couldn’t use the phone because it wasn’t changed. So I had to go to the lobby in person.  I reported this to the lobby but they said that they had only upper level room for now so they asked me to pay an additional charge. I got so angry so they suddenly changed their word and offered me no extra charge for a upgrade room.  New room was okay... but not perfect nor good. The phone…",2,June 2019,
"Wonderful, stylish hotel with great, friendly service",ClaveninSouth,"I recently spent two nights at the JW Marriott.  I only have great things to say about the hotel.  The hotel itself is very modern, clean and stylish.  The rooms have great views of Singapore and the infinity pool on the 18th floor is a great place to cool down and stare out at the city.  From the moment I arrived to my departure, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  I left something in my room and the hotel has been very helpful making sure that it gets sent to me.  I highly recommend the JW Marriott in Singapore.",5,May 2019,
Not qualified to be a 5-star hotel,886simh,"When we entered the twin-bed room, we were shocked to see that the room was so small, as well as the twin beds, compared to many other JW Marriott hotels. We needed to walk like a crab to move around in the room. The executive lounge did not appeal to us at all as the layout was confused and not users-friendly and the floorings looked cheap. We stayed in this hotel because we were invited to a wedding dinner at the Grand Ballroom which was walking distance from the hotel lobby. The Grand Ballroom was the only place we appreciated for the fantastic lightings and the extra big screen for video viewing. The only shortfalls was very inconvience for elderly to use the toilets in the basement.",3,June 2019,
Amazing Design and Staff,MikeDelaware,"This time we stayed at the JW Marriott property in Singapore and we were not disappointed. The design is right up our alley, clean lines, chrome, glass, mirrors and some awesome carpets. Arrived early in the AM and the room was available for us. Titanium member and I did use my Suite Upgrades that were accepted. I will tell you though, if we didn't get the upgrades, the rooms is amazing just as a regular room. Enjoyed the ammenities of the Executive Lounge. Helpful staff members, Hazel, Melvin and Brandon were always there to greet you and assist as needed. So the hotel is beautiful, but the staff made the trip. Every day you walk in the lobby area and are welcomed by at least 6 different staff members. Made you feel really welcomed.",5,May 2019,

Second chance not taken,Wala69,"I had a reservation for three nights and arrived around midnight. Check in always takes a bit longer in Asia, so that is what it is. As a Marriott Ambassador Elite, they usually upgrade you, which I do not expect but appreciate. The lady at check in said, the hotel was fully booked so they could not upgrade me. OK, no problem. Got my keys to the room, walked up and had a room with two twin beds. My reservation was guaranteed for a king bed though. So all the way back down, showed my reservation and got a different room with a king bed. Hold on, was I not just told the hotel was fully booked? How did I get a different room then? The next day I went down and asked if my new room was a different category than the first one I got and I was told, it was a higher category. So not only…",3,May 2019,
Outstanding Start to Finish,SurfNSky,"My wife and I just returned from 4 nights here. One of our all time favorite properties. Room was top-notch, breakfast buffet in the restaurant had a massive selection of cuisines (all delicious), exec lounge was superb, and the infinity pool...AMAZING! So relaxing to sit there with your feet in the water, drink in your hand, looking out at the spectacular city of Singapore. But what really made our stay was the staff. They went above and beyond to take care of us every step of the way. We hope to return one day, and when we do, we’ll definitely be staying here. ",5,June 2019,
Best Exec Lounge,Patricia,"I have been a platinum and now titanium elite member for over 9 years. The Executive Lounge at the JW Marriott in Singapore is simply the best I've ever experienced.  The quality and extensive food offerings and the warm service demonstrated by the staff is second to none. Hazel and Melvin greeted me warmly everyday and every evening. They were attentive and anticipated my every need. It was such a lovely experience, especially after coming back after a long day of work.   I cannot say enough about this hotel and the service. I highly recommend!!!",5,May 2019,
Great Service,lolaperdida,The JW Marriott Hotel in Singapore was clean and the service was excellent.  I lost my connecting flight and arrived a day later from my scheduled reservation.

Modern design - worse cleanness,Dennis E,The hotel looks very fine and is well placed near the Marina Bay Area. You could reach most sights by feet and also a lot of shopping malls are around the hotel.  The check-in process was very quick and easy and we got a room on the 6th floor. As we arrived in our room on the first view it looks very great! A lot of mirrors in the room and a really modern design.  But the air in the room was a bit dusty and smells moldy. The same smell was also at the whole floor from the elevator to the rooms. As we told this at the reception they Sent someone who sprays some parfume but this didn’t last half an hour. Then the smell was back. Asking the cleaners on the level they told us they couldn’t smell anything. So no one seems to be responsible for this issue.  But back to the room - as I…,2,May 2019,

Wonderful trendy hotel with excellent service!,Legoman,"Wonderful hotel in terms of hotel itself and services. The decor is very modern and chic (think The Cosmopolitan in Vegas) and things are very organized and clean.    We had a suite as part of a Marriott awards upgrade and had some issues with the ceiling due to the heavy rains. The staff immediately jumped on this and moved us to a comparable room (although it was a city view vs the great marina view) but offered us some credits into our account for our trouble.  The management team was great here for check in to check out, and the concierge was very courteous and even walked out with us and waiting until our Grab arrived to take us to the airport.

Awesome Hotel- Feel like Royalty!,Rivierajim,"My wife and I checked in late and were tired but the young man at check in was quick and professional and welcomed us warmly. He even managed an 'upsell' in a very friendly manner which gave us suite and lounge access for a fair price. All staff here are most welcoming and make you feel almost like family. Our room on the 21st floor was awesome, although with a few too many mirrors for my taste( small complaint) Lounge staff were all excellent and the variety of food available was great.

Terrific and outstanding services!,Alan Chua,"Booked a suite and had lounge access at the JW Marriott Hotel. The hotel smells nice upon entry and had service staff greeting you and showing you the way to the check-in. Check-in process was smooth and the room was wonderful. I particularly liked the executive lounge which provides TWG tea and a variety of snacks during afternoon tea. Breakfast at the Beach Road Kitchen was very packed on the weekend, hence we couldn't have a proper one, with food running out and not replaced swiftly. We opted for another breakfast at the lounge instead. Less variety but a lot more peace. Overall a wonderful stay, thank you.",5,January 2019,
Great lounge,Flora,The staff and lounge services were great. Hazel took the initiative to take care of us in the executive lounge. There were a great selection of cocktails and mocktails during the cocktail hour. Lovely modern hotel at an excellent location.,5,May 2019,
Spectacular place with outstanding service!!!,"wong, joanne","The Executive Lounge is probably the best of any hotel I've been to. The food options and the service we're EXCELLENT! The most accommodating staff we ever experienced! Hospitality feels like home, makes me wanna come back again. I'll like to give my compliments to the executive lounge. Kudos to the lovely staff ""Jollie"". She is very welcoming and professional and very eager to ensure this will be a great stay.The room was very Impressive including a very modern bathroom.Hotel is Nice and clean. Make sure you check out their pool on 18th floor. It's got a nice view of the city. I highly recommended!",5,April 2019,
Very nice but some issues,Claire@BXL,"The hotel is superbly situated and works well for business meetings. The meeting rooms are great. The breakfast is fantastic and the lounge is above average, without being extraordinary. The service is somewhat lacking as the room we had had a bathtub that did not work, and a phone out of service. It took forever to get it fixed. Changing room also took a long time as no one was available to help us move stuff around. But the staff were very nice and offered us a bottle of wine which was super nice. The room service is delicious and the swimming pool is great. The decoration is by Starck but a bit tacky .",4,May 2019,
It really depends on what room you get,champagne gypsy,"As you might be able to guess, we didn’t get a great room. We were sort of ensconced and behind two sections of the building facing Suntec City (it’s a huge mall that has everything). We were also on a lower floor, maybe the 7th floor? The room was dark and kind of depressing, especially because the tones of the interior are also just grey and white.  I had chosen this hotel based on some raving reviews on blogs. They showed gorgeous rooms that looked bright and airy. It’s my fault for not pushing for a better room as soon as we checked into our room. We just kind of thought, let’s just make the best of it. Life is too short to make an issue about a hotel room.   We had access to the executive lounge. They were generous with food and drinks. Staff seemed a bit too eager to have…",4,April 2019,
Outstanding hotel,PDM77059,"We spent 4 nights in room 1918. The floor to ceiling window had a spectacular view of the harbor and Major downtown buildings.  The room was somewhat small for two people given how we like to spread out suitcases on the floor for easy access but all the furnishings looked like brand new. Staff and housekeeping were great though the batteries in our room safe failed and they were not replaced.  Bathroom amenities were excellent and were replenished daily. The concierge lounge had 2 Mac computers which worked fine. But the breakfast, tea time and hits doubted were wonderful. Best lounge yet.  The room had a king bed, flat screen TV, replenished 5 bottles of water daily, mini bar, safe, full sized closet, bathrobes, electric switches to open and close both window blinds and window…",5,May 2019,

Superb 🙂✔️,Garry H,"The Culb Floor at this hotel is fabulous. From the wide-range of offerings including the hot made-to-order egg and noodle dishes, the wonderful selection of fresh fruits and breads, teas and coffees, it is very good. The evening cocktails and canapés are very enjoyable. The entire staff are pleasant, polite and attentive. A special mention for Hazel who goes just that extra effort - she is great✔️. ",5,May 2019,
Increidble breakfast and stunning rooftop pool,Dannie D,"I don't have a bad word to say about my stay at the Marriott South Beach. From the rooms to the staff to the food, everything was spot on.   The rooms are super modern and spacious with amazing bathrooms. There is a stunning pool on the roof which is the perfect place to watch the sun rise. I got up early one morning and had the whole roof to myself. It was breath-taking.   The staff in the morning at breakfast were fantastic. First of all there was every type of food you can imagine, secondly the service was outstanding. This was hands down the best breakfast offering I've experinced in a long time. I would stay there again purely based on their breakfast!   The hotel also has quick links to public transport and there are a number of restaurants and bars on offer.",5,August 2018,

Great Location - Excellent Staff - Fabulous Breakfast,RickyD23,"The hotel is in a great location.  There are three major shopping malls - Raffles, Bugis and Suntec City within a couple of blocks.  Also it is right on top of the Esplanade MRT station so you can easily get anywhere.  Great restaurant choices around and only a 15 minute walk to the Marina Sands and Gardens by the Bay.  Rooms are extremely comfortable.  Staff is very accommodating.  The included breakfast at the Beach Road Kitchen is unbelievable in quality and choices.  The infinity pool on the 18th floor a comfortable spot.  The Tonic Bar has 100 Gins to choose from but it is a little pricey.",5,April 2019,
Super attentive staff and an awesome in-hotel restaurant,94hemangm,"I just spent the last week at the hotel. The rooms are very well done up and all the room controls (switches drape control etc) easy and effortless to use. The staff are very attentive and helpful.   But the hidden delight was the restaurant - Akira Black. Though the city is filled with good cuisine, I didn't feel like going out and on impulse decided to try the Akira Black. Turned out to be a great decision. The food (I had the striploin and the wagyu fried rice) was super, the presentation had a nice flair and touch. Hanny and the staff there made this quite a memorable meal - Great food, superb presentation and attentive service. I think this experience exceeded par and I think this is going to make it on my list of must-visit restaurants.",5,May 2019,
Great service and excellent hotel,Michelle,"The hotel is well located, very close to Suntec city. The interior is astounding and the staff are always friendly and helpful; all my problems and questions are resolved quickly.

I had wonderful experience staying at this hotel.   Will definitely stay here again next time I visit Singapore.",5,April 2019,

Business Trip,Dominic,"Having travled a lot for business around the globle, I can honestly say the JW Marriot has been the best hotel I have stayed in for business or personal.  The level of service I receievd from the moment I walked into the hotel, to the minute I left was exceptional, I could not have asked for a better experience. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, they were kind, attentive, & polite.  Travelling a lot, hotels do become much of a muchness, however the JW Marriot stands head and shoulders above them all.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone who wishes to visit Singapore  No question, if and when I return to Singapore, I will be booking the JW",5,April 2019,

Literally located next to the famous Raffles hotel, the JW Marriott is within easy walking distance to the Singapore Flyer, the performing arts theatre complex (The Esplanade / the 'Durian'), and the Marina Bay Sands.  The room decor is decidedly modern, with bold-patterned carpets and wall hangings.  The bathroom was spa-worthy, featuring a large soaking tub, immense waterfall shower, and aromatherapy toiletries.    For Marriott Elites, there is the Executive Lounge on the 2nd floor.

Great location.  V modern,tireddad,Just spent 6 nights here on business.  I usually stay at the Fullerton which is very much a traditional 5 star place so this is quite a change.  Very modern with a slightly unusual layout.  The main building houses the rooms a bar (Tonic) and the executive club.  The main restaurant (confusing called bread street kitchen which is not dissimilar to certain Gordon Ramsey places) is actually in another building.   Aside from Tonic which appears to be a gin only bar the other bar is situated again in another building.  I went there every night for a nightcap and a cigarette (there is an ashtray vaguely near) and every night i was the only person there.  Great barman but anyone would struggle with making it an interesting place with only one slightly overweight Englishman present! …,5,April 2019,
JW = Just Wonderful!!,Matt88888888,"I spent three nights here on a work trip in April. All I can say is that I was blown away. I frequently travel to the garden city but this was my first time at the JW. I cannot fault anything about the experience. Firstly the place looks amazing inside and out, with every room featuring beautiful contemporary artworks, with even the elevators offering an artistic experience (you'll have to see for yourself). I was warmly greeted at check-in with a cooling drink and was quickly in my room, and checkout was smooth and quick a few days later. Visit the pool on Level 18 and sit in the spa looking south over the Singapore skyline.

Breakfast at the executive lounge is great!   The location of the hotel is super convenient.  it has underpass link the hotel to Raffles City, and Suntech City, which also takes to two different subways.

Five Star Home away from home,Sheella Peres da Silva,"I spent over 12 nights at JW Marriott Singapore as my daughter's guest. JW Marriott has been her home for about 2 months and I cannot think of a better home for her in Singapore. House keeping is great- her room is impeccable at all times. Room service knows her order and brings her dinner late at night with a smile and a kind word after she has had a long and hard day at work. We are always greeted with friendly smiles at the excellent executive lounge which serves up the most delicious breakfast, afternoon tea and canapes.

My Go-To Place - Exceptional Service!,Flashpacker08,"I have stayed at South Beach Marriott monthly for the past 8 months and it continues to be my go-to place in Singapore.  Not only the convenience of the location from the airport, office, and great restaurants, but the service is what puts this property far above all others.    Oliver, the hotel manager, has assembled a world class team.  Eva, who manages guest relations and is always helping me in advance of a stay to plan for my arrival, is truly exceptional.  She and her team have gone above and beyond every trip to accommodate my needs.

Pleasant stay and great hotel,Sara Asni A,"Stayed here for 3 days as layover, it was our first time in Singapore and this hotel is in the area where there's an mrt next to it and a shopping mall close by as well. Check in was quick and easy. Was upgraded to upper floor with the view of the marina. Room are a little modern but comfortable. Enough. Lounge are connected by a walkway on 2nd floor ( if I remember correctly) its huge. Nice to have a quiet zone though. Food choice are good too. Hotel restaurant were outside. So you do have walk a bit but it's all in the shade. Also have alot of food choice from breakfast to dinner. But you can always walk a little to find there are other eateries around close by. Thank you to all staffs for making out stay a great one. Definitely will be the choice hotel if return to Singapore ",4,April 2019,
Luxurious hotel in the heart of the city.,Ian T,"This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and it has never disappointed. As a leisure traveller the city is in easy walking distance or you can hop on the Circle (yellow) Line which is conveniently located next to the hotel. The staff are wonderful and cater for your every need. They make you feel right at home from the minute you walk through the door. The standards in the hotel are definitely 5* that not only includes the staff but the rooms, facilities and food. I cannot fault this hotel and will definitely stay again.  ",5,April 2019,
Pros & Cons,nomad6022,"I cannot decide the quality of this hotel. From one hand:  •	Excellent staff with top-notch service. •	Futuristic modern design •	Extra clean rooms. •	The bed is excellent, and sleep quality is great. •	State of the art hardware and plumbing •	Large beautiful executive lounge, with a lot of food including fresh fruits and vegetables. •	Good location, not within downtown traffic. •	MTR station in the hotel  On the other hand, there are some disturbing and weird design problems •	Check-in counters are in a narrow corridor, which is the only passage from the main entrance to the room elevators. I find it bothersome. •	Room desk-chair is an aluminum rocking, impossible to sit in it for more than 5 minutes. •	Rooms are small, even after upgrading.",4,March 2019,
Lack of Service,GolferBB,"It took me one and half hour to check in, which is the longest Check in time taken by any hotel that I have ever stayed at. On arrival, I was asked whether I wish to check in at the main desk or the club lounge. I chose club lounge which is normally the default option for platinum members. This was a mistake.  We were asked to take a seat whilst the check in lady brings over drinks and checks us in. After running backwards and forwards, offering no drinks, she and her colleague (who claimed he was the duty manager although I discovered later he was no such thing) took one and half hour, offering me no upgrade, even after I pointed out upgrades were available on their website. Eventually, I was quite possibly offered the worst room possible on the 3rd floor. The room hardly had…",3,April 2019,

Attention to detail,Betawi_Boy,"I was highly impressed with the overall experience that I had during my 4 night stay at JWM South Beach.  Very convenient as my office is right next door and there is an abundance of choices for food and drinks in and around the vicinity.    Staff are very friendly and there was never a time that one didn’t say “hello, good morning/afternoon/evening or night” when entering and exiting the hotel.  The Beach Side Kitchen is truly an amazing culinary experience!  Breakfast alone is a treat, as it is like having your own kitchen and pantry to help yourself to!    Highly recommended to both those on business or holiday, as either way you will experience “the royal treatment” during you stay. ",5,April 2019,
WOW!,Jenny,"JW Marriott South Beach is nothing short of awesome. Firstly it is perfectly located: across the road from the Hop on Hop off, walking distance to 2 malls, and public transport (200m) and lots of great restaurants nearby. It's also in walking distance to the Singapore Flyer (2kms) and other attractions, like the Gardens on the Bay.  The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome, and nothing is too much hassle for them. The Executive lounge is great, with excellent food and great service.  The room we had was quiet and had everything we needed, and then some!  I'd highly recommend this hotel for both tourists and business people as it more than caters for all kinds of travelers.",5,March 2019,
Another Marriott property with poor loyalty status recognition benefits!,Ranga K,I have always been a big skeptic of the Marriott takeover of the SPG hotels especially when it comes to the service levels provided by SPG to its elite customers.  This stay time and again reiterates why SPG was the best customer loyalty program that ever was in hotels and Marriott has done little to learn from this takeover.  No loyalty status recognition whatsoever at this hotel.  I wanted to try this property for the first time given some poor service levels at my go to hotel St Regis on couple of previous occasions.  I even mentioned that at my check in which perhaps went unheard by the check-in staff as she failed to capitalize on the opportunity.  Room provided was the std premier room that I had already booked - no upgrades and I'm sure the std answer will be we were full…,2,April 2019,

Beautiful views and facade,juzcrap,"Got the chance to visit the junior suite in JW Marriott Hotel on a Saturday night. The hotel is easily accessed via the Esplanade MRT station, bringing you up to ground level and the lobby is tucked away 1-2 minutes walk away.  If you are arriving by car, the drive-way is impressive and spacious. The lobby as I saw it, in all that dim lighting, was a long (narrow) corridor. The lobby was so dimly lit, it seemed cosy and romantic yet, if I am an arriving guest and trying to find my way around, I can't seem to see things clearly enough to get around!

Stylish hotel in a great location,Cranbury46,"We were given a great room on the top floor with views out over the harbor and Gardens by the Bay. The hotel is fairly new, well-maintained, well managed and an easy walk to several subway stops. We took the 30 minute walk over to Gardens by the Bay with no problems and the river was only about 10 minutes away. Breakfast was excellent and the Executive Lounge may well be worth the extra if your Marriott status doesn't get you in. We didn't use it for breakfast but did try it for afternoon tea and evening hors d'oeuvres. While the food wasn't the best that we've had in a JWM Lounge, service was excellent and more than made up for the somewhat cafeteria-style furnishings.",5,March 2019,
Fantastic Hotel.  Great location.,bj55808,"Singapore is an expensive place so having access to the lounge/breakfast is worth considering.  As one would expect, the staff at a Marriott outside of the USA is exceptional, this one included.  This lounge serves fantastic food and drink and the breakfast downstairs is among the best in the world.  We had a corner room with a great view.  The Metro has a stop within a block of the hotel.  I'd like to thank Kwang Sriwaja for her exceptional service and I'd like thank Hazel in the lounge who sometimes made my wife and I feel guilty for having what seemed like a personal servant.   It was a great hotel and a great visit.  It is fantastic service without having a stuffy feel to it.  You can't go wrong by staying at this hotel.",5,March 2019,

The attention to detail in the room is amazing, my #1 preferred room now (together with JW Marriott in Macau). I had a super good sleep and would come back any time.

I commend the personal touch of the staff and it was really wonderful.   Like how they recognise me after my first contact.   An example was going to the reception, and I was met with a staff. After I explained my need, she showed me to the next available counter staff whom I conversed with regarding my room.   Some time later, I came down again looking for the counter staff. This same lady showed me again to the next available counter. As I left to return to the room, she preempted my need and asked if I'd like to request for a ""late checkout"" and obviously I said ""Yes, thank you"".  The next time she saw me, she apologised…",5,March 2019,
Exceptional staff making the restaurant unusual,Raymond Wong,"I strongly recommend visitors try the breakfast of the hotel.  The restaurant is no exception from other 5-star hotels in Singapore, packed with people, usual food and drinks, crowded sitting areas..... However, I was deeply impressed by the  of the manage of the restaurant, Jacy Leong.  During my three days of patronage, he was around the entrance of the restaurant helping the receptionist in finding a seat for visitors soonest possible; greeting visitor with a smiling face; helping and advising staff in serving visitors; when time allows chatting with visitors.  His active and passionate working attitude motivates every staff. He understands a customer well.  On my second day of visit, he remembered that I am a lone traveller.  He tried his best to find a corner seat for me. …",5,April 2019,
Great Addition to Singapore,drosen85,"What a great hotel. I've tried many of the SPG (now Marriott) options around Singapore over the past couple of years -- and as of now, the JW Marriott is my favorite. This is not a luxury hotel (Ritz and St. Regis fit that bill), but this hotel is more enjoyable and in better overall condition than the older options.  The building is beautiful, great architecture and really modern. All facilities are immaculate.  Room is bright and modern with a large bath (separate bath and shower -- which is always appreciated). Lights work, plenty of places to charge devices.  As an elite Marriott member, had access to both lounge and restaurant for breakfast. Tried them both. The lounge has few options, but is much more relaxing and comfortable. The restaurant, while having a wider selection…",5,April 2019,
A very nice hotel in a good location.,pablolis,"We had a wonderful time at this hotel.  We really enjoyed a great selection of high quality food in the lounge, and an excellent view from the pool and sky garden.  We found the water in the pool to be a little bit too cold for our comfort, but we enjoyed a quick dip.  The weather was very nice and we had a good time walking from the hotel to nearby attractions like the harbour lion.  We received good help and advice from all the staff and especially from Hazel at the lounge.  We will be back some day.",5,March 2019,
Good location,atang1016,"Can't complain about the location of this hotel as it's conveniently located above MRT station and connected to Suntec City; which is a shopping centre with several food outlets as well as where The Big Tour Bus departs from.   Service from staff was good, but a bit casual for a 5* hotel. However, check in was rather slow. Two twin bed rooms were requested and whilst we understand it's not guaranteed, the front desk staff did not anticipate our arrival by allocating rooms in advance.  Instead, our room type was overbooked and we were asked to pay more for the next tier of rooms - which I feel it's quite unreasonable to make guests pay more for a mistake that was made by the hotel.  After 30mins of them trying to allocate the rooms, one of the rooms were ready and we were asked…",4,March 2019,
23 March 2019 Wedding,Chua jia ming,We had our wedding there and it was the best decision we made for the venue! The ballroom is mesmerizing and our Event Sales Manager (Wanyi) was very understanding and tended to our every request to make sure everything went smoothly. The service staff really went out of their ways to make us feel comfortable and always initiated to help us. Our guests had nothing but compliments for the ballroom and food. The screen and chandeliers were amazingly breath taking and we could choose from the many options for the lighting and screen animations.  We highly recommend this hotel! :),5,March 2019,
Great trip,jyoungl,"great hotel, service, staff, location. Very friendly and helpful staff. Staff in Asia always out perform the staff in the states in terms of friendliness. The rooms were nice.

Springbreak in Singapore,SLB,The JW was a great modern hotel and the rooms were spacious.

Stylish,JohnCarruthers,"A modern stylish hotel complex spread over a few main buildings surrounding a large restaurant/cafe courtyard area. Our room was a “deluxe” type. A little smaller than comparable “deluxe” rooms in the many other Singapore hotels we have stayed in but otherwise quite comfortable and clean.  Front desk staff were, mostly, excellent (see footnote). Other staff (eg wait staff in breakfast buffet) are a little less polished - often they will forget a coffee order or not clear used dishes. Breakfast buffet food was really enjoyable though. Two small (hygienic?) gripes to management- wait staff should take used cutlery away - we prefer clean ones for our next course; tongs needed for sugar bowls - I don’t know whose fingers have been in them when getting a cube for my coffee. There are…",4,March 2019,

From the attentive staff, to the great location (all major attractions were close by and the metro was a 100 meter walk) and the modern aesthetics of the property made for the perfect stay after a three week vacation. Finally, the concierge team was the highlight of the stay. Stayed during Chinese New Years and their restaurant and activities recommendations were a hit!",5,February 2019,
Let down,Perth WA,"Overall this is a nice hotel, well located given it has great access to the MRT and the rooms are better than average but you would expect that because of its price point.   Why only three starts then:  The club lounge is busy, not their fault, but the quality of the evening canape’s is terrible. Time and time again the hot offering was chicken, chicken and more chicken. The afternoon tea did not change in the 7days we were there, maybe it shouldn’t but I have stayed in many hotels where they vary it.  The service overall is well below standard, it goes from staff who simply don’t listen to staff who are over the top and treat you like their long lost best friend.   Would I come back, probably. Would I hope for a better experience, definitely.  ",3,March 2019,

Amazing good hotel,Lsn62,"Was staying there for 3 nights and what a wonderful hotel it is. Rooms are absolut clean and in top conditions. Staff is looking after you and are very helpful in every way. Had the feeling that the room was cleaned serval times a day, as there were always new towels. Yes 3 big and 3 small even if it was booked as a single room. Hughes bathroom with big cabins for shower and toilet and a wonderful bathtub together and within the same room as the sink. Breakfast numerous buffes are amazing - what better start of the day could you wish for. Pool on the top Terrasse with a very nice view over Singapore. So yes top - deco/designer hotel that is certainly worth staying at. ",5,March 2019,
Great Property--Even better staff,deltahater,"We arrived from a long overnight flight and were greeted very friendlily by Rebecca. The day before we were BONVOYED by Marriott Corporate and they had dropped our status from Platinum Elite to Gold without any reason or notification. That is important as we had booked the Ritz Carlton at first only to find out that they don't honor any benefits. So we switched to the JW in order to get the benefits. Having had our status removed the day before the stay was very frustrating and we fully share the frustration of many travellers with the HORRIFIC Bonvoy program. So here we are in Singapore without any status which meant no breakfast or lounge access. Rebecca to the rescue. We got two connecting rooms including lounge access which was huge for us.  The room was well appointed,…",5,March 2019,
Relatively enjoyable stay,DionneSingapore,"We booked the Deluxe Room for 3 adults for a night’s staycation. The location has an easy access to the Esplanade MRT train station and within short walking distance to Suntec City, Marina Square and Raffles City shopping malls. The Bugis area can also be explored by foot from the hotel.  Checking-in was seamless and the reception tried to get a premier room so that we could be waived the charges for an additional rollaway bed. Although unsuccessful, we are grateful an attempt was made to do so.  The room is spacious with a view of the business district. Bathroom was unusually large with the bathtub, shower and water closet areas separated.

When overpriced design overrules function,Michel,"In this hotel design rules over functionality; as so often ..the very people who ‘design’ for design’s sake never have to suffer their creations , and that for thumping S$ 350 per night!

The room hardly has space for one person but were a couple ..so please tell me where to put 2 suitcases plus briefcases – there is no space for it ! Very late we discovered there was a small storage (the door for which was so camouflaged we completely overlooked it) almost hidden area near the entrance ..but even then not wide enough to hold a reasonably sized suitcase  The space between the bed-end and the desk+rocking chair had the width of a briefcase!

Birthday experience leaves much to be desired,Nishan P,"I don’t normally review Singapore hotels because I think they should have the high service standards that Singapore should be proud of. My wife organized a surprise stay and booked a King Suite at JW Marriott Singapore for my 40th birthday. We had some guests who came over to celebrate the occasion. However, disappointingly, we realized that the mini bar fridge was not working resulting in a melted birthday cake and warm drinks. The hotel sent two technicians to take a look and they had to literally take out the unit and replace one of the components. While they were doing the repairs we had guests having to wait for drinks and inconvenienced while avoiding the dismantled components which had to be placed in the common living room while the technicians worked.

"Ok hotel, should’ve chosen another Marriott",chloes1,"Yes the hotel is attached to many malls and in close proximity to a couple MRTs but overall I regret that I didn’t choose another Marriott for our short 1 day trip to Singapore. One of the few Marriotts that did not upgrade us with Platinum status saying they were at 95% capacity- normally even without an upgrade they could place us on a higher floor but we were on the 4th floor.   In addition we had breakfast at their restaurant - food was quite nice but service was terrible. Servers who spent more time ignoring you and cleaning rather than offering an order of coffee. Patrons who came in after us who were served their drinks and coffee before us. Our table cleaned and everything removed when we came back with another plate of food.

I have Marriott Ambassador status, and even though everything in Singapore tends to be just a bit better than travels elsewhere, my coworkers, clients, and prospects staying elsewhere were consistently impressed visiting the hotel and restaurants and wishing they were staying here instead of the Intercontinental and Mandarin where they were.

Phenomenal,Yusef G,"I will begin with the only negative aspect of this hotel... they don't seem to care much about your Marriott Rewards status. I was a Platinum Premier Rewards level member at the time (I am a Titanium BonVoy member now) and they did not offer me a room upgrade. Even after mentioning it to them I was not upgraded.  Other than that, this place is absolutely amazing! The location is in the South Beach development, which is situated adjacent to Marina Bay Sands and attached to a great shopping mall.

I am a Marriott Titanium member, so we used the lounge a lot (breakfast, drinks, and snacks), and the staffers there were great, especially Ann and Zann, who made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy ourselves (as well as arranging a taxi for our departure).

There is another pool at another wing of the hotel, but i didn't manage to check that out. Rooms wise, i love the long walkway from the entrance that leads to the bedroom, passing by the toilet. Really love the mirrors all around the room, and that huge one which doubles up as a sliding door at the toilet.

The room is brightly lit with natural light as i entered. I was, fortunately, the room was at the corner of the building catching a busy cross-road but views of Singapore's financial hub.

Though some of the rooms in the main tower have sweeping views of the city, many or most of the rooms in the East tower seem to have reduced natural light and uninteresting views.

I landed at the hotel at around 7am - it was an early checkin and the lady at the reception told me either I upgrade at an additional $90 a night or endlessly wait for a guest to vacate. I told her I was exhausted after a 6hour flight and it would be good to know by when I could get a room. She said she does not know and I can wait.

This makes staying in South Beach very assessible to lots of places. Plus there are a couple of eateries around this property which I as a local patronise frequently.

A lot of potential to be great,CGK_Traveler,"I stayed here for one night to try the hotel out as part of a plan to change my loyalty from the Hilton family to Marriott/SPG family. I checked in via the app, noting arrival time of 12 noon and received notification that my room was ready around 8.30 am. On arrival I was intercepted my a friendly gentleman who walked me to the check-in desk. The check-in process was efficient and the associate was friendly and thorough and as expected my room was ready.  I booked a Club Deluxe room and was assigned one on the lowest floor not that I minded though as I really appreciated having the room ready well before the check-in time. No issue with traffic noise or privacy though as the room was well insulated. The room was a reasonable size, although half of the space was taken by the…",4,February 2019,
Eye catching Ballroom & Exceptional Service,O.H,"I have so many thing to say after my first visit to this hotel to attend my lovely relative wedding on the 24th February . It was definitely a pleasant from the step I entered the hotel till the the moment i step out , the bellman the ,  service staff was really very  polite and really helpful to help us with the direction to the ballroom.

I did not want to leave. Epic hotel stay!,Robert S,"I stay at many Marriot properties. This particular JW property is the best there is. A property that other JW properties should be measured against. Upon arrival as a loyal Titanium member, I was provided a suite upgrade. This was the perfect oasis and home away from home during my business trip. The staff at this property are All professional and highly attentive.  The executive lounge provided the best experience and choice that I have ever seen in any previous Marriot experiences. Top notch.  The property location is also perfect and convenient. The room was perfectly clean and very tidy, apportioned with the best fixtures and amenities. I highly recommend this hotel!!",5,February 2019,
2nd memorable stay,marsjanet,"We returned to this hotel as we had a terrific stay there in July especially because of the staff memeber at the lounge. Again we had a larger premier room with club access. As I have checked in via the app everything was already prepared and did not take long. It was a very kind and attentive staff member at front desk. Our room was located on 19th floor and we had a stunning view overlooking Marina Bay area. The room itself was a great and well stocked with amenities as experienced on our first stay. A special thanks to our housekeeper Yuan Li, who always left our room impeccable. When we went to the lounge we were even recognized by the host at the entry and it felt like coming home for us. Later on we met again all the other wonderful staff members like Kwang, Melvin, Hazel…",5,February 2019,
Nice service and artistic room,wesleywaisiu,"The location of this hotel is right on top of the MRT station with a big shopping mall nearby which can be accessed underground or by skybridge.  The hotel has a lot of artistic decoration, even inside the room, which doesn't look like the normal JW Marriott.  The room is a bit small with a lot of mirror, personally not really like it.   The hotel prepared us a nice anniversary surprise, a wine and a delicious cake. We enjoyed them very much.   There are 2 swimming pools, but very small and fill with Chinese tourist taking photos everywhere.",4,November 2018,
Always memorable,Esme X,"JW Marriott is always a first choice, and it comes with the best memories! We choose to stay here on every family visit and have been embraced by constant warmness.

Can’t wait to come back again☺️☺️",5,February 2019,
Excellent Service,scotborderstraveller,"Chose this hotel as close to the office - I’ve stayed at a few JW now, and know what to expect in terms of quality and service. From the moment of arrival the service was excellent. A complimentary upgrade and access to the lounge was most welcome, as that had been omitted from the booking by our corporate bookers. The room was light and airy, the bathroom large and well equipped. I always ask for a quiet room and had been located at the end of a corridor at the rear of the hotel which was ideal. The breakfast offering had an excellent selection and the staff in the lounge discrete but attentive. Definitely will be choosing this hotel when I return to Singapore later in the year.",5,February 2019,
Really good Marriott hotel,Steve M,Stay here because it’s really close to work.  BUT It’s a great hotel. Super modern. Great features. Nice lounge.

Still the best,Daniel O,"I stayed here last year and wrote that this was my Favorite hotel. Since that time I have traveled to several different countries and stayed at numerous hotels, both Marriott brands and others. When I was able to travel back to Singapore I jumped at the chance. I booked the JW Marriott and was greater with an email welcoming me back.   The hotel staff is helpful and courteous. They go beyond your expectations at every level. As a Platinum Elite Ambassador, they upgraded my room and it was inviting, cozy and state of the art. It felt like home. The lounge is great and if you get the chance to eat at one of the many restaurants you will not be disappointed. The beach Kitchen is an excellent choice and I ate there many times. The location is perfect for walking and enjoying the…",5,February 2019,
Being platinum means nothing at this hotel,Liz P,"I use Marriott all over the world,but have never been treated with so much disrespect anywhere. I asked for a room upgrade at the deserted hotel only to be told it’s £40 a night extra.The room we were first given was claustrophobic,with no space to even walk around the bed.The second room offered was slightly larger but still way too small for a long stay.  We had to ask the cleaner each day at 4pm to clean our room,the reply was go and ring reception.What kind of 5 star hotel offers such a poor service.I was just astounded at the all round poor service offered by the hotel.  The staff in the executive lounge were great and really helpful,it’s just a shame that other areas of the hotel could not do the same in particular the reception who I would say were border line on racist…",2,February 2019,

Location turned out to be fantastic for us - easy walking to Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, National Gallery and more.  The hotel experience itself was very special. Check in was efficient and we were helped by a very friendly young lady. Also we received a wonderful room upgrade to an upper floor with some great views.  The room was wonderful. Extremely comfortable bed. Modern design that takes full advantage of the view. Really nice, large bathroom, with separate bath, shower, and toilet stall.

We were wowed. Singapore Sizzle in a Hotel,Capricious1,"January was my 7th visit to Singapore and there is something about this city--it's always changing along a 10-year plan--that really appeals to me.  This time the wows started with our hotel, the new JW Marriott Singapore South Beach.  The glamour starts at the entrance with its stunning floor-to-ceiling glasswork design.  Then we rode the elevator to our 13th floor room, an experience in itself, as the elevator had an undersea feel with shifting octapus and fish walls.  Our room overlooked a staggering view of the War Memorial, the Padang, the National Art Museum (which we visited) and--in the distance--the skyscrapers of the multi-nationals and, to the left, the Marina Bay Sands where a boat reposes atop twin towers.  We could even see the port where our ship was docked and…",5,January 2019,
BAD Service,MAZTAPLANN,"I came with my wife carrying 3 luggage and there were no porter helping or assisting.  Foreigner came with small luggage and front desk like a puppet quickly pushing the luggage for them. Room design were ok, but for woman's that need to use hair straighteners or dryers,beware that there are not a single power point in the bathroom. You need to slide the mirror and use the powerpoint for the kettle. Ask for a wine glass, it came wet with hair inside. Complain about it and they gave us a sorry note and 8 bottles of water. We ask to check out 1 day early and wasnt allowed.",1,January 2019,
5 star hotel with stunning view of the pool,FoodTraveler_Huangshuzhen,"If you are looking for cool design hotel & love to get some fabulous shots for your FB or IG, the place is right for you. Stunning view is on 18th floor around swimming pool & two chairs on the water. You can get the view of city and don’t forget to come at night too.  The room with Marina view should be good choice but the price is also high. MRT Esplanade is just a few steps so it ‘s convenience for you to go around and shopping at Suntec, City Link or Raffle. Bathroom and tub may not good comparing to other facilities. Everything is white & with mirror so it is easy to make dirty. ",5,February 2019,
Beautiful hotel but not very functional,heroandtoffee,"Very new and beautiful hotel, however, not very functional. There is only one hook in the bathroom with no chairs and place to put your clothes. So you are running around feeling quite stupid. Both the swimming pools are small and shallow with one of them used as a bar area. The Japanese restaurant Akira is well worth a try.",4,February 2019,

Wonderful Hotel with Great Service,Cyn,"Spent 5 nights in Singapore at the JW Marriott. Everything was amazing, but what made this trip so amazing was Tasha at the Concierge Desk and Melvin in the Executive Lounge. These 2 were so helpful. They gave me good tips on where to go and what to do.  The hotel itself is conveniently located at the Esplanade train station so getting around was so easy. My room had a perfect view to the Marina so I was able to watch the fireworks from my room every night.   The only negative I would be that the rooms could use a little TLC. A good wipe down, a thorough dusting, dry clean the soft goods and a fresh coat of paint are in order.",4,February 2019,

While we waited, Hazel came over to provide a map and her tips to help us make the most of our pre-cruise stay.  Hazel was a joy each time we saw her after that, making sure we were very comfortable and enjoying ourselves.

Best Marriott Property EVER - bar none,inosof,"JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore is my number one hotel in all of the hotels I have stayed in.  The combination of the stylish room, location, amenities, and most of all, their STAFF, is top notch.  The staff at this property is absolutely BEST.

I wish I know each and every individual by name.  They deserve to be recognized.  Next time, I will get their business   Very clean, very well organized room.

Outstanding staff hospitality and great location!,O4324AQmariad,The hospitality from all of the staff in this hotel is second to none.  The Executive lounge was amazing with an assortment of dishes to please every guest.  The food was exceptional and I tried many new foods while visiting Singapore.  The hotel was centrally located to everything and within walking distance to almost everything.  The rail system was convenient and a great way to see the rest of the country.  One of the safest and cleanest countries that I have been to in the world!,5,October 2018,
Great hospitality from all staff and comfy bed in strategic location,Annonymous289,"Great hospitality that never fails to surprise me. Love their personal touch and small gesture. Even from the housekeeping and the technician also never fails to surprise me. The toilet cover was malfunction and I lodge a feedback. After it was repaired, he left a note and a cute LEGO man, put a smile on me after I see that! Good job! Even the housekeeping also very caring and anticipating my needs. I left my laptop charger on the desk and guess what she left behind and even with a personalized hand written note! She left behind screeen/lens wipes! Good job Dina. All of the small gesture really counts to make us feel at home and welcomed. Needless to say about the bath tub with aroma salt that elevates your tiredness and their comfy bed strategically located near to bugis.",4,January 2019,
Great hotel and location!,Ishtefh,"Nice hotel and near the train station, the staff were friendly andI love the interior of the lobby. Room is spacious enough, stayed for 1 night only for the SC marathon. Will definitely book here again for a staycation.",5,December 2018,
"Excellent selection, fantastic ambience",Sweeney1582,"Been here twice for two special ocassions being celebrated by my family. The range of food is wide and of high quality. The ambience adds to the entire dining experience. The final element is the staff, attentive and professional.  ",5,November 2018,
Inconsistent service,Ang Zhou,"Good overall experience, nice room and amenities as one would expect from JW.  Fantastic service from the housekeeping team who left a lovely message in the room with extra bottles of water due to Hugh temperatures (most probably sop but nice touch nonetheless).   Front desk service definitely not up to scratch. Seems that any question or request for help is a bother. Agents always seem to be busy with piles and piles of paperwork. Upon checking in one of our rooms was not ready because previous guest had a late check out. Agent informed us that HSK had to check the room but she didn’t know how long that would take... surely all she had to do is to radio/contact floor supervisor to give us an ETA? When requesting extra keys another agent made a fuss about checking my ID(which I…",3,January 2019,
A good choice.,NelCalifornai,"Overall, we were impressed with this hotel. The concierge (especially Debbie) and the front desk staff were very helpful. She was able to put together a New Year's Eve package for our family at the last minute.  However, our family needed something and called from our room to request it but unfortunately Pamela gave us attitude which was very disappointing and unprofessional. Also, we left behind 2 bags of laundry in the built-in closet and it was never recovered.   The location was good considering that you have to get a Taxi or Grab to go to most places in Singapore. The view from the 18th floor pool deck was stunning. The rooms were nicely decorated but a bit on the small side.",5,January 2019,
Great hotel,Monkorn U,Well located just minutes away from the MRT station. Wonderful room and so clean. All staff helpful and polite. There are 2 swimming pools in the hotel which is a plus. Didn’t try the breakfast though. Highly recommended!,5,December 2018,
Excellent as always Visit,flik4888,"A couple of family and I had a staycation at JW Marriott over the weekend in December and it was as great as always.  A special thanks to Ms Ann Margareth from the Exec Team for always looking out for me and my family. This has to be one of the best executive lounge folks I have met through my extensive travels.  She took care of all the room requirements and also special care of the kid we had throughout our stay.  She had also introduced us to the spa facilities and made arrangements for us to try out the heated pool.  This time round, we had two rooms booked. As expected, rooms were in great condition. The property is really well kept and the two hotel pools well stocked for the weekend crowds. Well recommended for a short staycation or even a long stay. Keep up the great…",5,December 2018,

An unforgettable stay for us.",5,December 2018,
Perfect situation,mtvgb,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here in this comfortable and well situated hotel. The staff were excellent and went out of their way to help us in any way they could.  The situation is excellent. Our room overlooked the famous Raffles hotel and we could easily walk to many popular sights. There is a convenient MRT stop just by the hotel.   The rooms were compact and lacked storage facilities, although the drawer containing snacks etc was emptied for us to use. The bathroom had an odd layout. We liked the heated loo seat and cleaning facilities and appreciated the ability to use the eco button if you are conscious of conservation issues.   Breakfast was excellent and we found most things quickly refreshed and only queues at the weekend when the hotel suddenly filled up with young…",4,January 2019,

We had a fantastic stay at JW Marriott South Beach,John,"We had a fantastic stay at JW Marriott over the New Year period. This is a stylish and very modern designed hotel which exudes a luxurious feel to it. It is located within easy walking distance of MTR stations, restaurants and shopping centers. The Premier room, we stayed in, had superb views of the Marina Bay Area and the New Year’s Eve fireworks. I loved the complimentary box of chocolates that was given to us on New Year’s Eve. During our stay, it was also my birthday and the hotel gifted us a delicious coconut and cream cake to celebrate the occasion. I definitely recommend having a drink from the bar by the pool on level 18, the view of the city from there is fabulous. We would definitely stay at this hotel again next time we visit Singapore.",5,January 2019,
Outstanding service in The Executive Lounge,OZ friend fm Melb,"Everyone in the Executive Lounge was just amazing in their customer focus.

You are the unsung heroes.",5,August 2018,
"Second stay, not the same result (VERY DISAPPOINTED)",wwtravelerRochester,We stayed at the Marriott last February and had a fantastic stay.  We are platinum and enjoyed the lounge benefits.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we rebooked our current stay 1 month after we left Singapore.  We had a great stay and met some great staff in the executive  lounge. We asked them who we should write to to give feedback on our stay. We also had some small issues we hoped would get fixed as well. So we wrote to the Rooms Division Manager. He acknowledged our comments and asked us to contact him on our next stay. So we contacted him 4 times over 2 months before our stay this time with cc to other people who told us to contact  them as well. We are still waiting for a reply!!!!!!! Other staff after 6 more notes passed replied basically saying they can't help us or…,3,January 2019,
Excellent service Brilliant location,Destiny88li,We stayed at the JW Marriott S B for our anniversary and birthday celebration during the week of NYE. We had a really memorable stay and thank you for the personalised Birthday card and delicious cake was so nice and we were really pleasantly surprised. Excellent view for fireworks and we enjoyed our stay with the delicious chocolate amenities on the eve of NY. Excellent Hotel stay.  Beautiful lobby very relaxing atmosphere as you walk in and was great by FO staff - really friendly polite and prompt to service. Especially Marc at the Lobby really made my family feel welcomed with his warm attentive and professionalism service.

Delightful Experience,Julia1306,"We arrived in Singapore after a difficult long flight, due to bad weather conditions. I thought I never wanted to travel again, until arriving at JW Marriott Hotel. I changed my mind straight away. The hotel staff were welcoming and attentive. Our room was excellent: beautiful interiors, spacious, comfortable. There was a pleasant and unexpected surprise there as well: people don't normally talk about it, but the toilet in our bathroom had a smart electronic seat: the lid opens automatically once you enter - you don't need to touch it - and closes automatically as well, once you leave. It does all sorts of other useful things - I am not joking! :) Previously we only saw this type of facilities in Japan. But the most impressive thing was the view from hotel's infinity pool on…",5,December 2018,
Wow! Stay here!,Rose C,"My first visit to Singapore was made even better by staying at JW Marriott.  The entire staff was extremely professional, helpful and well trained with the many questions I had about Singapore. The buffet breakfast is one of the best I’ve ever had anywhere and our rooms were so modern, clean and beautiful.  I also enjoyed both the infinity pool on the 18th floor as well as the one on the 6th floor.  Not once did I feel envious of the people who stayed at Marina Bay Sands because the JW offered a great location to walk around and to the Esplanade MRT as well as the nearby shopping centers.  The hotel is super close to the Raffles Hotel and CHIJMES for those Crazy Rich Asians movie fans.  I could only be so lucky to stay here again if I ever return!  ",5,January 2019,
Highly recommended,Dale Baker,"I would like to thank the staff at JW Marriott for making our stay such a wonderful time. Me my Wife and 14 year old daughter spent 8 nights there over NYE. Hotel is in a great location with the MRT circle line CC3 directly beneath and easy access to shopping and restaurants. an easy 10 min walk to Marina Bay and the sights or the other way easy walk to Little India. we had executive lounge access and where not disappointed, great breakfast afternoon tea and horderves  with cocktails and wine included.

Simply the best!,serenehosl,"I first discovered the JW Marriott South Beach in March 2018 when I won a contest for a culinary event and decided to book a room so that it would be easier for me to attend the various workshops. I was totally blown away by the wonderful room and great service and since then I have returned for 5 more stays and I have enjoyed every single stay and in fact I have extended my stay on several occasions as I could not bear to leave.  The hotel is in a great location in the city and it is linked to 2 subway stations, Esplanade and City Hall, and also to  several malls in the City Hall, Suntec and Marina Square vicinity. It’s really convenient to get around as everything is linked undergrond so there is no need to worry about being under the hot sun or getting soaked in the rain.  It…",5,December 2018,
Highly recommend JW Marriott South Beach,Cheryl,"Would like to thank one of their staff, Raymond THAM, for assisting us throughout our stay at JW Marriott. It was planned for my daughter’s birthday. He actually prepared a surprise cake and desserts for her on her first day of stay and on her actual birthday. She was really happy and enjoyed herself so much that she asked to be back for her next birthday. While exploring around the hotel with my 6 months old son in a stroller, we met Raymond during his lunch break and he volunteered to guide us to where we wanted to walk to. The room is excellent as we were upgraded to a suite. Thank you JW Marriott and Raymond for the arrangement. It really made our trip very enjoyable. We can’t wait to be back with my two children again. And hopefully we will meet Raymond again.   Thank you…",5,December 2018,
"Beautiful hotel, wish I came at a less busy time",skyaiee20,"I stayed at the JW Marriott News Years Eve. There were many people like me checking in that day - I thought the staff did a wonderful job optimizing the check-in process. We didn't wait long and they gave a small drink on check-in.   Our room was comfortable - exactly what you'd expect from the JW Marriott. It felt clean, comfortable, and luxurious. The towels felt higher quality (thicker & softer). The robes were tempting enough for me to slip into.   I didn't pay extra for a view so I didn't really expect much - our view was to the mall. Was slightly disappointed we weren't put in the main (taller) tower. They have 2 towers which I didn't realize prior to booking. I don't think it really impacted our quality of stay though as the Infinity Pool which I specifically booked the…",4,December 2018,
Favorite Hotel in SG,Ivy83,"Stayed at JW Marriott for two nights over the weekend, due to layover between Hong Kong and Yogyakarta. After this stay, JW Marriott South Beach is my choice going forward in SG.  Checked in 1 day before via mobile app. Smooth and was taken to the club lounge upon arrival. (Club access for platinum members) Room was ready and an upgrade was given to a larger room. Requested for twin and extra foam pillows via app. Both were given at arrival without being told again. Love the Marriott beds!  Room 2101 was spacious. Plenty of bottled water and towels. Lots of USB outlets for iPhone charging. Complimentary tea bags from TWG refilled every day. Evening turndown were done on time and silently behind the scene. Housekeeping did a fine job.  The highlight, however, was the food.…",5,January 2019,
Polite and cheerful service staff,AngieTay,"Staycation in hotel for New Year’s eve to welcome 2019. Despite full occupancy, checkin is still not as bad, around ten minutes of wait.

Wonderful,CDrewB,"We stayed the weekend in Singapore as part of a business trip through Southeast Asia.  The Singapore South Beach hotel was in an ideal location, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The hotel offers convenient access to the Mass Rapid Transit, and is only a short walk from the wonderful restaurants along Marina Bay.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and the accommodations very comfortable.  Don't forget to check out the amazing views from the pool on the 18th floor!",5,December 2018,
Great hotel with excellent customer service,Amlan R,"Reached a bit early and luckily Reuben at front desk intervened to accommodate me with a nice room. This allowed for a good stay over 3 nights to see clients and speak at the Singapore FinTech Festival.  The breakfast manager compensated to rectify some offhand curt behaviour at check in initially. Again Reuben had helped.  Great breakfast, good concierge and good front desk. Best of all great tea making facilities, nice bathrooms and always stocked with 2 bottles of free drinking water.    Maintains the high standards of the J W Marriott franchise.  Taxi stand not there so during rains a bit of 4-7 min delay getting cabs.",5,November 2018,

Perfect Singapore end-of-year break!,Fiona F,"Absolutely fabulous place to stay, great location, fantastic staff, perfect accommodation.  Don't search further. Have stayed in many different hotels in Singapore, this is one of the best!

Some very good/excellent aspects let down by a couple of things,Sapna G,"The positives -   Firstly, I cannot fault the staff at the Executive Lounge, the Spa and also the housekeeping staff. They are friendly, courteous and such a credit to JW Marriott. They all went over and above what was expected and really made my family and I feel very welcome. For example, my sister slipped in the Spa (there are no grips outside the women's jacuzzi which I am sure Is a health and safety hazard) and hurt her leg. The Spa staff quickly called someone to bandage my sister's foot and followed up with her the next day which was great. They also left a 'get well soon' gift of chocolates and fruit in the room which was unexpected but lovely.  the layout of our room and quality of furnishings are amazing. you really feel lucky to stay in such a place. I also liked the…",3,December 2018,
Excellent service,Lauren P,"The JW Marriott South Beach is worth every penny, from the super comfy beds to the extremely accommodating staff to the delicious breakfast buffet. In my particular case, I fell quite ill during my trip. The staff did everything they could to make sure I was comfortable and taken care of including a late night emergency room change. Thanks to this hotel I still have a great memory of Singapore despite falling terribly ill!   I look forward to coming back soon and taking advantage of the incredible infinity pool and lounge area!",5,December 2018,
Great stay in Singapore,Erin W.,"A beautiful hotel in an accessible location.  The executive lounge was a great perk - lots of food options and excellent service, especially from Hazel.

Worst year end staycation ever,JTHK,"We booked this property with our SPG points and upgraded to a Premiere Suite with breakfast and lounge access.  Pros:  Great location, and near to 2 MRT stations with shoppings centres. It was also within walking distance to the Floating Bay platform where we went for the Star Island SG countdown performance. It has an amazing swim pool with great view from its 18th floor. A cake was given to us as complimentary for our year end celebration hence we did not have to get one on our own.  Cons:  There is a need to improve the check in experience. It took us almost an hour to check in. Brandon was a very great host though in making sure we are comfortably seated in the lounge while waiting for the check in. Food supplies run out and the lounge is always busy and crowded.

I was just staying at Tang Marriott couple of days before the staycation here and this hotel win it all in terms of its' modern layout, facilities and ambiance. As usual I will share my following review pointers based on a 1-night stay during Christmas Eve. 1)      Location: Strategic location where you have no problem getting a cab and it's just few minutes away from esplanade MRT & Suntec City but yet avoiding huge crowds passing by the premises.  2)	Staffs and Services: Always smiling!

"Awesome overall, but there’s catch",Thanakorn,"I stayed 4 nights in November and it was my first time stay at at this property. As Platinum Elite my room was Pre-upgraded and have full access to Executive Lounge for full breakfast services and evening cocktails. Room was very nice, it looks out to Raffles Place as well as the famous Marina Bay from a distance. USB charging port can be found by the side of the bed, wifi working great and work desk is spacious - all is great. But there’s a catch - breakfast and evening capapés selection at Executive Lounge is rather disappointed. Food quality has nothing to compared to The Westin, Renaissance, Swissotel the Stamford, Marco Polo Hong Kong, Marriott’s Club Lounge. I eventually went out looking for food and order Grab for dine in. ",3,November 2018,
No room available until evening!,Eddie Wing Sing Lo,"It was surprising to me that J.W. Marriott Singapore delivered such unfair and bad service to their Gold card member.  We arrived on Dec 26th, 16:30 but the room we booked was not available until that evening.  I requested the reception to give us our booking because we had 18:30 dinner function which we needed to change and be ready for the evening.  After tough negotiation, they provide us the lower level twin bed room without view which my original booking was high level, city view larger size twin.  We took the room as time is running short and they charged me the original price without adjustment. The worst thing wasn’t the room rate but their guest service did not come back to me after calling me at our room. I filed an complaint to the Marriott website and they said this…",3,December 2018,

Beautiful hotel. Wonderful stay all around.,Sid Lasley,"We just wanted to share some positive feedback regarding a stay at the JW Marriott in Singapore. My wife and I were staying there to celebrate our 20th anniversary.   The hotel staff was wonderful, as usual. We would like to specifically note how well we were treated by the team in the Executive Club. They were so warm and welcoming – always engaging us in a lovely conversation and often giving us meaningful local insights to attractions and dining options.   While the entire staff was truly lovely, we specifically wanted to mention how well we were treated by Hazel, Daniel, and Melvin.   We would highly recommend staying at the JW, if you are visiting Singapore for business or pleasure.   Beautiful hotel. Wonderful stay all around.",5,December 2018,
"Excellent staff, very attentive ",Conor Savage,I came back to 14 bottles of water in the room ;-)  Staff on checkin were incredible. Getting transport was also super easy. The room service is a little slow but food is great. The annoying thing is that they ask you to call to collect and not leave outside. It’s annoying.    Breakfast is not normally included but across the road. Now it’s got everything and it’s very tasty,5,October 2018,
Amazing property with Perfect location and TOTO Toilet,Mridul Kumar,Anyone going to Singapore should definitely stay in JW South beach. The hotel has chic white interiors and amazing view of Merlion.  I spent 5 nights in Marriot and stay was nothing but comfortable! Location is perfect with major attractions within walking distance. The pool has a breathtaking view of Marina bay  during night. The highlight for me was TOTO Toilets in all the rooms( which is usually found in suites of other brands). Overall the stay was really comfortable and I'll definitely book this property again when I'm in Singapore.,5,August 2018,
Perfect in every way!,Theatrenthusiast,"This Marriott location is perfect! Easy access to the shopping and attractions, all within walking distance.

The bathroom is fantastic and includes a rain shower, separate oversized soaking tub, and the power Asian toilet! There are 2 pools on the property, the pool on the 18th floor has superb views of the bay. The executive lounge is open to members for breakfast, afternoon tea, and cocktail hour.

The staff in this hotel is incredible.",5,December 2018,
Fantastic Hotel - great Festive Break,taffysdelight,"Normally a serial Dubai holiday-maker but decided to go to Singapore for a change. Apart from being a far superior city to visit in terms of the heritage the JWM is certainly a match for its Dubai counterpart.  Smooth check in, attentive staff, great facilities.  A word for the executive club - always well staffed and stocked with excellent snacks - good choice for breakfast and an extended drinks/ cocktails period of 3 1/2 hours. Most welcome after a long humid day exploring Singapore. Particular thanks to Hazel who kept us entertained and served over the 8 days.  Also great Spa facilities - free use for Gold Members.  We’ll be back.",5,December 2018,
Disappointed,CaptainDen,"My first stay at the same hotel last year was amazing. That’s why I booked it again this time. However, this time the hotel has disappointed me a lot. First, the room that I stayed was much smaller than the one I stayed last time even though I booked for the same grade. I called the reception and see if they could arrange a better room. However, they claimed it was the design of the room and they could not arrange another room for me as it was the festive season. Second, the room was a bit dilapidated. I remembered during my first stay in Dec 2017, the room was so neat, tidy and brand new.  After 12 months, some of the facilities were already in pool condition. Scratches on the walls, dirty carpet, etc. They even used a duck tape to fix the smoke sensor on top of the bed. It…",3,December 2018,

The staff recognized me as a Platinum member, and I was upgraded to a swanky suite with amazing views. The highlight of the hotel is the swimming pool on the 18th floor; it is an infinity pool with amazing views of the city. Couple of minor suggestions to the hotel staff: - consider heating the water in the swimming pool it was a tad bit cold. Also recommend, continue to work on managing the restaurant crowd during the late breakfast hours: it was a bit frantic.",5,December 2018,

Perfect Place For Us,funsville,"Exceptional facility, location, employees, services and room.   The first thing that happened was a greeter escorted us from the front door to check-in and then offered us a lime beverage (popular beverage in Singapore).  The second thing that happened was a minor housekeeping issue. And when I say minor, I mean unless housekeeping was wearing X-Ray glasses, it would have been difficult for them to find this particular problem. But still, we needed it taken care of, so we reported it to Patricia downstairs near the front desk (As an aside, I'm thinking Patricia is my favorite hotel employee of all time).

Modern Hotel made wonderful by staff,Immersion101,"Hotel looked very new, even funcky with elevators that come with changing lights.  Rooms were modern in design, and fully equipped as expected of Marriott. Location was superb, with many of the Marina and Gallery all within walking distances or a train ride away.  Staycation experience made even more wonderful by staff, especially Gina from Housekeeping (KSKP). Gina left a handwritten note to thank us for staying at the hotel, which felt very warm.  She made sure tea and water were in no short supply (we didn't need to ask for any), preparing the room timely, refreshing the room accordingly at least twice a day.

"Comfortable, modern and a good location",thehopster,"You can see the Philippe Starck design everywhere. If you are a fan, then this hotel is for you. Throw in the Foster and Partners design and in theory you are onto a winner.   The public areas feel warm and inviting. There is a certain mood feeling in the hotel which works. the rooms are Starck white (nice play on words) and although on reflection the rooms are not large, the design works.   Nice bathrooms and very comfortable bed.   We had brunch at Beach Road kitchen and the service and quality level of the food was great. They had a credit card promotion on at the time and this made the bill exceptionally good value.   The view from the pool deck (level 18 I think) was fantastic and overlooks the Padang and down to the city, however it can be a little cold as you get the…",5,November 2018,
Great hotel experience,GattoViziato,"This hotel has been recently added to the JW Marriott family, so when you book a taxi you may be taken through the back entrance.   My overall hotel experience was outstanding,  they have a nice lobby area with many restaurants near by that are all very good.  My hotel room was very modern, clean and fresh.  My bed was very comfortable and relaxing with a nice bathroom   I had complementary WIFI which made my business travel very comfortable.  The hotels serves a full menu breakfast which included western and Asia menu's.  This was a good stay.",5,November 2018,
Good Choice in Singapore,TJG214,"This is a typical international JW.  The facility is clean and well-designed, rooms are large and comfortable, and the service is superb.  It is within walking distance to essentially everything in Singapore, including the Marina area, Arab Street, and Little India.  The JW restaurants are pricey and not great, but there are many other choices within an easy walk.  The concierge lounge is excellent, one of the best I have seen.  There was a great deal of noise one night (a wedding reception perhaps?), but otherwise it was reasonably quiet.  I imagine higher floors are quieter, further from city streets.",4,December 2018,
Great hotel in Singapore.,Jliem064,This was a great place to relax.  Good location near MRT and restaurants.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Saathis Mohan really was helpful when one of my children had a fever. Would definitely consider returning if back in Singapore.,5,December 2018,
Pleasant experience,Sunny K,Rooms- a bit too small For the regular Mariott users feel cramped at times. Ask for a higher floor always Cleanesss- without a doubt good Lights- for some reason each of the rooms had a crazy green ligt not sure whats the intention but if u r here for business after a days work the lights do tend get u dizzy Food- average although i didnt explore many options but nearby u do have a good variety to Go explore restaurants and pubs Close from the esplanade metro stop  The best part about this place is the view from roof top. Its worth visiting and spending a few hours watching singapore night life lit up.   Also check the madarin before u book this place. They pretty much provide the same rates but i think the service is more prompt and quicker there.,5,October 2018,

Exceptional,PJSSS,"Wow, we loved this hotel! Aside from its great location with fantastic views of the Singapore skyline and Marina Bay area, the hotel is class all the way!  From the minute we stepped inside this hotel, I knew we were in for a wonderful experiences. Check-in was quick and highly personalized. Front desk staff were warm and welcomed us with a drink while completing the check-in then escorted ya to the room.   Room were spotless and well appointed and had electronically operated blinds and drapes. The bathroom great and we loved the automatic ToTo toilets. Bath amenities were of high quality.

Room cleanliness not up to par,Judy D,"I'll start with the positives of this hotel. The property is beautiful and the grounds are really nice. The elevator is decorated in carpeted sea animals that change colours, which was pretty trippy but I loved it. The front desk staff were really welcoming and friendly and offered us a welcome drink as we were checking in. The location of the hotel also gives you some great views of Singapore's skyline and the bay, especially if you head to the 18th floor (also where the pool is).  Our major issue was with the room. The room was small, which we expected and were ok with as it was a short stay. However, it was surprisingly dusty in the room. The curtains had dust on it, the blinds looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while and when I opened the closet, dust particles flew…",3,December 2018,
A nice trip and good service,vergeryan,"We stayed three nights at the hotel. We loved the infinity pool on the 18th floor, it had great views of the city as well as the Sands Hotel. Our room was small but with a good view and very functional. The concierge lounge had a good breakfast and afternoon happy hour with food, but the lounge itself is down on its luck. It is dark, stark and in need an upgrade. Being on the second floor is also a draw back since it has not view.",4,October 2018,
A GEM OF THE JW MARRIOT BRAND,Coosemans H,"After a 26 hours flight from Houston to Singapore, to attend a wedding the very next day, its such a delight to get situated in an amazing suite with the Marina Bay view.  Very grateful to Hazel, Zann and Eva at the executive lounge  for remembering Earl Grey as our favorite tea, and their attention to us. Breakfast at the beach road kitchen is really special as there are great selection of Singapore local dishes besides the international choices, very impressive. Great hotel is always about the people like Saathis Mohan the bellhop who found my lost jacket, Ma Wei who left a sweet note for us wishing us a wonderful day daily, after cleaning our room. The service in this hotel is just simply Platinum Elite worthy that sparkle with the JW Marriot touch. Special thanks to Mr.…",4,November 2018,
"Outstanding Service, Ammenities and Accomodations",CarpeDiem777,"I have been in more Marriott properties around the world and by far the Singapore JW Marriott was the finest and provided the best accommodations and services of any JW property world wide.  The staff from beginning to end was exceptional.  Upon check-in we were given a beautiful upgraded suite that was spacious and designer furnished.  We requested a view but we opted to take the large luxurious suite instead of a smaller room with a better view.  (it would have been nice to have both!).  The concierge was extremely helpful in recommending restaurants, bars and tours.  The gym staff went out of their way to assist with all of our needs.  the gym was clean and the equipment was state of the art.

Nice Hotel with Friendly staffs,khengsoon,This is one more nice Marriott hotel. It's always a pleasure to stay in the Marriott group accommodations. This is no exception. Nice decor exterior. Excellent cleanliness. Room was very comfortable and relaxing. There were so many good selections for breakfast that one is spoiled for the choices. I really enjoyed my stay there.,5,December 2018,
Superior Service and Accommodations,PandaLovesTravel,"New hotel that provides superior upscale services and accommodations.

The Most Amazing JW Marriott awaits you in Singapore!,Wesley Reed,"I am a Platinum Elite member of Marriott, so for me it is routine to go to their properties all over the World.  But I was particularly wowed by this Property.  The staff is amazing, both professional and efficient.  The Housekeeping crew pays attention to the most details.  And the property itself is pretty impressive when you walk around it from the outside.     The Executive club had excellent service and food available.  In addition the location is perfect for exploring the City.  There are two MRT stations right nearby.  And a Shopping Mall is right next door if you want to pop over and pick something up.  Don't forget that there is also a Grocery store in the Mall called 'Giant'.    Arab street is within walking distance.  I was so exhilarated to be there that I actually…",5,December 2018,
Marriott has huge room for improvement!!,Icyxmas,"The development on its own is astounding! South Beach felt like a world of its own, separated from the outside world. However the overall hotel experience and service standards were NOT on par, given Marriott is not a new player in the hotel industry.   I booked a Premier room with Executive Lounge access. Granted early check in was subjected to availability, I waited almost an hour for room to complete inspection. Arrived at 2:00pm, went through the usual check-in paperwork, was told room was ready but yet to be inspected, asked to wait a bit. 2:30pm came and still no news; meanwhile 2 huge tour groups came and all of them were already distributed room keys! Asked front desk again and she said official check in time was meant to be 3:00pm anyway. If the 2 tour groups could have…",2,December 2018,
Exceptional Hotel,chrisABQ0522,"Very nice hotel, great staff and location.  Hazel in the Executive Lounge is so friendly, she made us feel very welcome each time we visited.  Always a big smile, made sure we had everything we needed.   When I was checking in, I realized that I forgot my cell phone in the taxi.  The concierge Mr. Muzaffar Azrin Bin Jamil asked me a couple questions about the taxi, the rate and then jumped into action.  I was sure that my phone was lost but somehow he was able to track it down.  In under an hour I had my phone back, I was completely amazed at how resourceful he was.   Excellent customer service by all staff members, I will certainly visit this hotel if my travels bring me back to Singapore.",5,November 2018,
"So far, SO BAD",robert k,"We are Platinum premier elite so expect a lot quite honestly, and receive it automatically always.   Not so at this facility!  The front desk arrival, starting at curbside, saw us passed from one rep to another.   Asked to take a seat, then asked to register at the empty counter.   No thank you for our loyalty, although they did mention our status.   No offer of an upgrade...?   I asked for one.   Answer, ""we will see..."".   Staff seemed very green.   This is a new hotel, but not that new.  We were sent, not escorted, to our room.   Immediately upon entering I was disappointed, and unhappy.   SMALL! SMALL! SMALL.   Tiny really.

Experience,chewmeiying,Check in process needs to be reviewed. Arrived at 3 pm as check in time but did not get a room until 4.30pm. Mobile app sent via email did not work for me- did not detect the room booking. Internet speed is very slow in the room. Had to resort to using the 4G network. I think the hotel is overpriced for the service provided. However room view is great overseeing the marina bay & padang. Gym is well equipped. Located near Raffles city & Suntec shopping areas.,3,December 2018,
Stay elsewhere unless your office is an amble from here.,Sonali Singh,"It is perhaps one of the few properties I have been to that clearly didn’t pay for design.  The rooms are jarring in colours and materials and use of space. The in-room dining had perhaps two vegan options. And the restaurant for breakfast was disorienting.  Please choose literally anything else to hope for better.  On the positive side, it is a Marriott property with good service orientation where you will cover the basics of a five-star property.",3,December 2018,
Good experience,Sheeja D,"This is my second time, and better experience as I learnt from my last. The lower floor rooms can be dingy due to the facade of the building. Try to stay above level 18. I requested and hotel kindly put me on the 21st floor. There are some observations on inroom Dinning. I was unhappy with quality and quantity of food 3 of 4 times of order. The good thing is that they listen, in fact their team lead GIGI came to apologise and indulged with some nice dessert and wine later. Second feedback is air conditioning in the gym which is terrible. I remember i had mentioned in my last review and also others had too. So feedback continues. Also they are very rigid to access to lounge. Strictly platinum only.",4,December 2018,
Great service and comfortable rooms,Chris de B,I have stayed here several times but the latest stay was even better than normal. All the staff are friendly and helpful. Two examples - when cleaning my room while I was working on my laptop I was given several packets of screen wipes and at breakfast in the Executive lounge by the fourth day the gentleman cooking the eggs/omelettes brought me my normal fried eggs over easy with bacon without my asking for it. In fact the continual smiling greetings are almost OTT. My only criticism is that the metal chairs are not that comfortable. I look forward to my next stay.,5,November 2018,
Fantastic and central to sights.,KiwisNZ2010,"We stayed here for three nights. Everything from Reception, thanks Tommie, to the rooms and the food were top quality. Super helpful and friendly staff. Central to getting around Singapore. Happily stay there again. A+++++++. ",5,November 2018,
"New hotel, very comfortable",ladodgerone,"Nice new hotel in a business area without a lot around, but the hotel itself was very nice.  It's done in a modern style with W-like features, but less harsh and with more comfortable lines.  I appreciated the buffet breakfast across the way in the detached restaurant.  The room itself was comfortable with a good bed and a nice view.    Only issue was that checkout was a disaster--long queues and very slow service, in which they would have you sit down because the wait was so long.  Other than that, I would return.",4,November 2018,
The BEST service ever,KiraCooper,"I could live in this hotel!!! It has absolutely everything you could want and/or need. Breakfast, Afternoon Tea, Hor d'oeuvres, evening cocktails, gyms, pool, spa facilities and so much more. Every staff member was polite and always greeted me. There were 4 in-particular; Hazel, Raynor, Bella and Maya. Hazel went above and beyond serving guests. She even got me a map of Singapore and showed me all the places I should visit. She made sure I was well taken care of every time I went to the lounge. Raynor is one super mixologist and remembers exactly what guests like to drink without them even asking. Bella is so kind and knew exactly what she was doing. I would've have never known she had only been with Marriott for two months. And Maya cleaned our room and it was immaculate.

Weekend Staycation,Fared Jhi,"Where do I start? It's all truly amazing from the lobby to the 2 pools then to the service.   Upon check in, got upgraded to a premier room with a beautiful view of Singapore's skyline and the room was appointed and designed in a super chic manner. Thought the key card didn't work, but it's actually the door that was thick and heavy which requires force to open. The room were high tech from the toilet, the curtains and sheers which can be controlled from the side panel or from the TV itself! I definitely love the mirrors around the room which gives a very modern vibe to it just like the colour changing elevators.  There were 2 pools, one faces the skyline the other a more serene and quiet which faces Suntec. The views really make up for it but Flow18 gets quite crowded and there…",5,December 2018,
Getaway before the holidays!,christophertTorio,"The JW Marriott was awesome! The room and amenities were top notch, the room service was timely, the restaurant offered great food, and the bar had a bartender who gave us great cocktails and tips that made our stay even more enjoyable. We felt the hotel was very close to many locations which made it easy to walk rather than taking cabs/uber. Highly recommend!",5,January 2018,
Great service,Dillon H,"Service at all levels was great and responsive. Concierge and front desk was prompt with requests that we had.

Fantastic property and amazing service in executive lounge,Cfinnsta,"From start to finish my stay at the JWM was great. One of the perks of being platinum premiere elite is access to the executive lounge and late checkout (which was confirmed via email before I arrived). The executive lounge offers a lovely array of snacks and drinks to choose from, but what sets it apart from other Marriott lounges is the service.  The staff is professional, polite, and attentive. I had the privilege to interact with Hazel and Raynor throughout my stay. These two individuals went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and had what we needed at all times. I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting Singapore whether it’s for business or pleasure. You won’t be disappointed.",5,December 2018,
Dirty wine glass,Ully Triani,"I stayed for 3 nights and on the second day, I had an unpleasant experience when i about to drink wine.. I took the wine glass in the room and it’s sooo dirty, a lot of stains and you can see lip marks.. It’s so disgusting, and it’s so disappointing as it’s 5-star hotel.. I made a complain to the hotel and they gave us a bottle of wine for an apology.. It’s a nice gesture and we really appreciate it.. But however it’s not acceptable because when you choose to stay in JW Marriott, of course you won’t expect such things, it makes me think what else they didn’t wash properly?   For the interior design, it’s nice and very modern, but i think the room is quite small.. The bed is super comfy.. Location is really great, surrounding by some nice restaurants..

The only place you would want to stay,Roberts2005,"Just returned from a one week stay at this property as a Marriott platinum member.  The hotel is in a great location for both business and leisure travelers.  Everyone on staff went out of their way to make our stay special.  It was impossible to return to the hotel with out someone greeting you with a ""welcome back""  Our first room was on the 20th floor with a wonderful view of Singapore.  We were later moved to a corner suite with a separate living room.  Both rooms had very large modern bathrooms with both tub and shower.

From the minute you drive up they assist you in every way. We have Elite status and had access to the Executive Lounge which is one of the best.  The people working in there are absolutely fantastic and very friendly-they seem to enjoy what they do.   The view from the pool area on 18 is like no other-it’s actually better than from the Singapore Flyer.  We will definitely be back to this hotel in our future.  ",5,December 2018,

Premier Marina Bay Suite,AbsoluteZeroKelvin,"Stayed 1N. As a Plat, I secured a huge Premier Marina Bay 1BR Suite using Suite Night Awards.  Located on the 20th floor,  I was rewarded with fantastic views of the city skyline and nearby Indonesia. The suite comes with a large living room,  but sofa and chairs not very comfy. Bed was super comfy.  Large bathroom!  Probably the only hotel in Singapore where the potty provides unobstructed views of the Marina Bay!  Downside,  terrible in-room wifi. Club Lounge is very large.  Breakfast at the club lounge was extensive,  unfortunately everything was self service including the morning coffee. Avoid the club lounge on a weekend unless you love restless noisy kids. Managers and staff at the club lounge and front desk were all very courteous and helpful.

Great design hotel in central location,JS Berlin,"The JW Marriott used to be an independent design hotel and you can definitely see this. The design does not resemble any other JW I have stayed at but I like that touch of individuality. The hotel is rather big and on the business side of things. I arrived a night later due to cancelled flights and I appreciated that the hotel offered all my elite benefits to my girlfriend at check-in before I arrived the next day. Also staff at the executive lounge were great and I enjoyed the personal touch they added in such a big hotel.  The hotel provides great views from the pool and some of the rooms.

Please send this compliment to Talgat and kudos to JW Marriott for having an excellent employee. You have make our stay a memorable one.

Accommodation,nancyhanson,My husband traveled to Asia for 33 days celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary.  We spent one night at the JW Marriott south beach in Singapore.  We were created by Sarah in the concierge  and she was so helpful in giving us ideas to see her city in the three days stay that we had.  We had a beautiful room with nice view and a great cake and surprise bottle of wine to make our stay so very special.  We had a wonderful stay here before we got on the cruise ship.

Exceptional Service,davidhutch23,"This is the third time in 12 months we have stayed at the JW Marriott and the fact that we have returned speaks volumes for the quality of service we have experienced . Attention to detail from all levels of staff from housekeeping to reception is exceptional; this is a hotel that welcomes you as a person and not number and provides a professional level of service. The quality and range of food from Beach Road Kitchen and the Executive Lounge is fantastic and I would recommend opting for these services. This is a hotel that has a unique modern ambience, set within a complex of luxury sophistication and is a must stay venue for this wishing to be in the hub of the Marina / Colonial area.",5,November 2018,
Well appointed hotel,OBIE1_13,"Night arrival - Staff opened car door on arrival, walked me inside with some chit chat.  Very polite and friendly.    Handoff to other staff at front desk area.

One of the two went to find me on the list which I assume is when the did their bulk room assignments for those checking in via the app.  Staff was friendly either way and accommodating to a degree.  Room was assigned to a twin bed room, so I asked for a king instead.      My reservation was a Premier room type and that's what I received.

Stylish and comfortable,Dan L,"Too often style comes at the expense of comfort - but not at JW Marriott Singapore. This newly converted property makes you feel a million dollars without being pretentious or foreboding. The breakfast is the best I have had anywhere, the infinity pool on 6F is really amazing with a great view, enough space to do laps and very stylish individual tiled seating areas, and the location is very convenient for those with business in the Beach Road area. The staff are also very polite and friendly without being imposing. The rooms are cool but big, however I would suggest they rethink the sofas and rocking desk chairs as they are really not that functional. However, all in, I’d say this has now become my go-to hotel in Singapore. Well done!",5,December 2018,

Staff are exceptional - polite, welcoming, helpful and professional. I also used the luggage service and it was fast and efficient. There at least a dozen good to great restaurants in the complex and a lovely bar in the hotel itself - ""Tonic"" (as in Gin and Tonic).

Perfect 30 day stay,Gary W,"From registration until the moment I left, everything was perfect.  Due to being a loyal SPG member I was immediately upgraded to a Junior Suite which was spacious and very comfortable.  It was only on the 4th floor so the view was nothing to write home about but everything else was spot on.  The entire staff was very friendly and super helpful.  The executive lounge food and drinks were awesome, as was the lounge staff and chef.  The hidden jewel that was not heavily advertised was the pool on the 6th floor (roof) of the second building.  The water was warmer, it was never crowded, it was relaxing and had a spectacular view.  I would highly recommend this hotel and hope to be able to stay there again.",5,November 2018,

Amazing Hotel and Incredible Experience,Anish M,"As a platinum elite, staying at Marriott properties all over, I’m extremely familiar with what to expect from the brand. This was hands down one of my top three stays and experience ever. For starters, terrific location, right in the middle of everything. A hotel that oozes luxury with incredible amenities and an amazing team of staff. I was upgraded to a spectacular suite on the 20th floor (of 21 floors) with the most breathtaking views of Marina Bay and the city skyline! Very well appointed, comfortable and spacious rooms with upscale amenities. The executive lounge is one of the best ever too. Fantastic ambiance and staff with excellent hors d’ouvres, high tea, breakfast and an open bar with top shelf everything daily!

Simply perfect,Cocoa1993795," An exceptional vacation and stay at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach.  I frequently embark on international travel - I am an inconsistent reviewer however, on this occasion I feel an expressed need to compile  a review -  great service requires noting.  JW Marriott is perfectly situated, clean bright and overwhelmingly welcoming.  I would like to  initially  pay a personal thank you to  staff members - Wai Ying Wong and ‘Patricia’ - Front desk executives, Asrid and Yai all  of whom made and ensured my stay was personal, memorable and formidable.  On my return to Singapore I will book my ‘ home away from home’ at JW Marriott South Beach.

As Usual,BWY,Excellent experience as usual at Marriott.  Very friendly staff.  Visited 2 restaurants (Akira Back & Tonic) and their executive lounge during my stay.  All staff are very attentive.

Trend setting hotel with a great view,Terrence_Chee,"Looking for somewhere new and trendy to stay with a great view of the financial skyline and close to major shopping malls? JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach is the place. The hotel is situated right next to the Esplanade MRT and surrounding the hotel are the shopping malls of Marina Square, Raffles City, Suntec City, Millenia Walk, Bugis Junction.

Amazing Hotel,AryaSumit15,"Great hotel with lovely ambiance. Feels lively wherever you go in this hotel.. be it the lounge, restaurants. View from the 18th floor where the gym and pool is amazing. Also the staff is courteous, helpful, and friendly, remember having a brief chat with room attendant Maya. I was not feeling well the day i landed, the doctor assistant helped until i felt well. The in room dining food menu can be expanded a bit though. Thanks! Sumit",5,November 2018,
Another Good Stay,Ken A,"I just spent 2 nights at this property.   The lobby had been remodeled since I was there in February and seems to be more efficient than the original layout.

Wonderful Wonderful Stay,prestontan,"At the invitation of Marriot Vacation Club, I was originally supposed to stay at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  Due to the other hotel running short of rooms for that weekend, I was offered the JW Marriot for a weekend staycation between 2 and 4 November 2018 complete with an upgrade to the premier room with breakfast for my wife and me.  It is with great fortune that I stayed at the JW Marriot.  Upon checking in slightly after 3 pm, I was attended to by Johnny.    Johnny is a pleasant gentleman who serves with a smile.  He certainly knows his business.    Johnny offered me a room with the Marina Bay view for a small upgrading fee which I accepted.

well appointed hotel - friendly feel,LondonMadmax,"Although not the most pricey hotel, it has a great ambiance and feels slightly boutique, despite the size.

A Mixed Bag,BENLEE123,"I usually stayed at my favourite Ritz Carlton Millenia. This time I decided to try the JW Marriott South Beach for a change. This is the second JW Marriott hotel in Singapore.   Arrival  I arrived by taxi. Bellhop wasn’t attentive to approach my taxi nor open the car door. They did eventually realized I was checking in and offered to help with the luggage which I declined. I was escorted to the check-in desk.   I booked a Deluxe Suite. I tried my luck to ask if there is a possibility of upgrade to a higher tier suite. The staff looked truly puzzled by my request only to reply she couldn’t do it because the hotel suites were full.

Well worth a visit,mkbhoy1973,"A fantastic JW Marriott Hotel right in the heart of Singapore. It’s got everything I love in a hotel - engaging and personable staff, atmospheric bars, a fabulous fitness facility (which is great if you’re suffering from jet lag as the nighttime views over the city are stunning) plus one of the most well-stocked executives lounges I’ve had the privilege of visiting.

"Good location, poor check in",Jmahg,"We have stayed here on a number of occasions and although the basic rooms are not big and rather poorly designed with uncomfortable chairs there is a reasonable sized wardrobe, a good bathroom with bath and separate shower. There are USB charging sockets beside the bed and on the desk which are a sensible addition. We stayed one night both going and coming back from Australia. On both occasions we had problems at check in. First we had to wait some time, although on this occasion my partner's gold card status was acknowledged  and we were assigned a good sized room but on our return we were given a twin as opposed to the double we had booked and only when we queried it was it changed and no acknowledgement of our gold card status.

Fantastic stay at the JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore!,Michel,"What a wonderful stay at one of the coolest JW's I have ever stayed. Felt like a boutique hotel at a mega scale. Fantastic lounge, breakfast buffet, cool Court Martial Bar nearby with wonderful June making unique cocktails. Most memorable was my arrival, with Keith, a VIP guest relation agent, welcoming me with 'Good evening Mr. Michel' when opening the door of my limousine at the hotel. In just a few minutes, I was all set and off to my hotel room. Felt like I had signed away my soul. Sure will be back!",5,November 2018,
Perfect stay in every aspect!,SteveWang81,"I stayed there for 2 nights and everything was impeccable. The hotel was beside Esplanade metro station and easy to reach by public transportation. Its lobby was artistic and creative that I was much impressed with the candle-lit decoration hanging from the ceiling, not to mention its fashionable furniture and aesthetic ornaments along the hallway. My room was also spacious and trendy, with large french window to capture city view, and my neat and bright bathroom was well-equipped with separate bathtub and shower space. There were also a large gym and a rooftop swimming pool in the hotel, but I had a tight schedule in Singapore and had no time to enjoy them. Everything there was amazing and I will stay there too next time I visit Lion City.",5,November 2018,
Spectacular place with extraordinary service,Hellofee,"Booked the hotel way in advance to ensure that I could get my hands on their suite (which I have heard many good reviews about them) for my birthday staycation.   Let me tell you the whole entire story:  I had my suite booked for a Friday and I booked a one bedroom suite with the Marina Bay view. However, there was a no communication about my room till the the day I checked in. That early morning, I went to check on my reservations via Marriott app and realised my reservations was amended. Didn't really care much, just wanted to ask about it when I check in later that day.   I tried to do an early check in around 1230pm (just to try if an early check in was possible) - however, it was not available till 3pm due to a back to back housekeeping service.

"Great hotel, flawed billing and management",Rahul Kamdar,"Stayed for a week in Sept for work. Great hotel and location. Decent food options.  Checked out, few weeks later happen to review the invoice. Found incorrect charges and reached out to the hotel staff. They send an email back asking me to tell them what are the wrong charges - utterly absurd and clueless. Weeks of conversation later the manager makes refunding the wrong charge seem as if a favor is being done. I wonder if every customer (whether P Elites or otherwise) should take a double scan at their JW invoices.  Poor accountability. Takes weeks for the line-managers to respond. Given the incredible options in Singapore, I'd give this a miss on my next trip.",2,September 2018,
Excellent and in a perfect location,rfi30,"We spent 3 nights at this hotel. All staff were very welcoming and couldn't have done more to help us and make our stay most enjoyable. Rooms are spacious, clean and light. The beds are really comfortable. Food is also excellent.

Reputable hotel in a good location,nnchin,"Bell boys are attentive to their tasks, from the drop off to the hotel lobby whereby a front desk female personnel took over and usher us to the reception for the check-in process. There were quite a crowd but we were informed of the wait & were shown to be seated at a comfortable sofa & served the welcome drinks. The overall check-in procedure was a pleasant experience.   The elevator is securedly operated by tagging ur room card to access your specific floor, the lift however is a wee bit too dark for my liking. There’s 2 swimming pools situated in different towers conveniently joint by a walkway, 1 has a much better view than the other, pool view is a luxury, and limited deck chairs, limited direct sunlight too.

More, the executive lounge is closed and cannot even get a cup of coffee, much less anything to eat. Staff while polite, not helpful and certainly not welcoming.

From the warm reception by Rebecca to Chef Jason in the kitchen our stay @JWMarriott was exceptional in every way.

The lounge staff truly made the stay enjoyable and really made you feel appreciated to be a elite member. Location is hard to beat, great views and right by the SMRT and connected via underground or by pedestrian bridge to Suntec mall. Not a far walk to Chinatown or Boat Quay for good eats and drinks. Property has several bars and restaurants attached or in the complex area. The gym is quite small but the lap pool offers comfort and great views of Marina Bay.

A big thank you to the Sous Chefs in both the Executive Lounge and the Beach Road Kitchen who took a great deal of time and effort to identify all foods containing nuts to my daughter in relation to her allergy, and also offered to cook alternatives - fantastic service! We had dinner in the Beach Road Kitchen which was a bit pricey but well worth it (hotel guests pay a reduced rate)- an amazing array and variety of food was on offer and it was delicious. The pools and gym were excellent and great views of the city can be enjoyed from the bar area. Compared to other local…",5,October 2018,
Great hotel for business,Liz W,"Stayed here for 4 nights in the deluxe room. Bathroom was very spacious, with the shower and toilet sectioned off (only negative is the rainfall shower head needs maintenance, as it was spraying everywhere but down).  Check in was relatively easy, you’re greeted by someone who then asks you to take a seat and they bring you a juice. Upon check out, you wait around again until they call you up to the counter.  Breakfast was across from the main hotel off to the left, there is a wide variety of food at the buffet but not worth the cost if it’s not inclusive in the room price.  The hotel itself is located in a convenient area, and a lot of places are within walking distance. The MRT station is a couple of escalators down.",4,October 2018,
Great staycation,Joanna L,"Relaxing location right smack in the middle of town.  - Clean and reasonable sized room. Lots of mirror, easy for ladies to do their makeup.  - Bathroom with a tub, bath salt and everything you will expect from JW Marriott. The hairdryer is powerful.  - There are two swimming pools. The one on the 18th floor has a better view but no sun. We prefer the other pool on the 6th floor.   - The price difference for the room rate with breakfast is just sgd20 for two pax and it’s really worth it for the spread with hainanese chicken rice, cooking station for noodles soup, lots of topping choices for your pancakes and waffles and a wide variety of milk from the usual to pistachio milk or walnut milk.   - The elevators are really efficient too, we never had to wait more than a minute for…",4,November 2018,

We were accommodate in a Premier Marina View one bedroom suite, which was large and very modern but not not too functional. The bedroom of the suite was of a very good size and the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was well appointed and large so was the additional toilet. The living room was very spacious but strangely decorated and to our liking. The hotel itself was very beautiful and well positioned. Walking distance to the marina, Singapore flyer, shopping malls.

I can honestly say that it was one of the best breakfast I had in JW Marriott and I stayed in many around the world…",4,November 2018,
Not So Impressive,Tony M,For a JW this fell bit short in my opinion. Rooms though spacious has metal chairs which give a low cost look. Housekeeping was somewhat lacking and had to be called and reminded to make up room. Breakfast restaurant and staff excellent and choice of cuisine very good. It's a nice property and well located if attending exhibitions or events around Marina Sands Bay but for the price one would pay it can ramp up its offer more.,3,October 2018,
Executive Lounge staff needs refresher training on customer service,Eysi,"Requested for an early check-in (1pm) prior to coming to the hotel, property said ""noted"" but there's no guarantee that the room will be ready by then. Arrived past 1pm, as expected the room wasn't ready yet. The check-in process was slow, I was standing for so long waiting for their system to process whatever they needed for me to check in. Anyway, it was okay since the lady at the counter was nice and polite (Sarah).   We booked a room with Executive Lounge access so Sarah told us we can wait there and have some refreshments first (she accompanied us to the lounge).

Although at first I was a bit concerned by the frazzled checkin process, the rest of my stay was absolutely perfect.   The Executive Lounge was huge with loads of space and seating for guests, ample food (fresh) and a great selection. The room itself was modern, spacious (king bed, comfy not rock hard), with all the modern fixings (aka electric blinds).   Best of all (by far) was the roof top pool. Absolutely stunning views of the city with a 360 degree deck around the entire 18th floor. Around the back they had the gym, pool table and foozball along with a bar.

It's a fairly short jaunt from here to Clark Quay and other nightlife hubs. Otherwise, it's incredibly easy  to get a cab out front, and every cabbie I  interacted knew of the hotel.

Less than we hoped for,Pamela H,"My Husband and I are frequent guests at the JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore and have Premier Platinum status. Our two week stay this past September was less than we hoped for. We were upgraded which was nice, however we were put on the 21st floor just below the newly opened residences which begin on floor 22.  There was construction and remodelling going on in the residences which produced a lot of noise.  I will also add our room smelled of mold.  We asked to be changed to another room since our stay was going to be two weeks long and the noise was aggravating. We were then escorted to look at a room on the 14th floor but I did not even get out of the elevator because the entire floor smelled.

The executive lounge is well run with excellent personnel that are friendly and efficient.  The food and drink are definitely worth an up charge. Thanks to Hazel and everyone of you in the lounge.

Positives are that it’s a good location, well served by taxis and easy to get on the MRT. The hotel is new, clean and modern. I didn’t try much food as it was a quick trip but the menus looked varied. Room service offered a good range of options. Staff were attentive.   Rooms are clean and modern. Overall I thought, however, that rooms are pretty small for the price tag.   I will return for another stay in due course.

Hmmmm could be better,Thomas K,"I checked in today (October 23, 2018), and it started on a wrong foot! My profile clearly states upper/high floor (though I fully understand that it's based on availability), but I consistently get a high floor (always) plus a room upgrade (unless the hotel is sold out). As a Marriott Lifetime Platinum Premier Member, I've been loyal to the brand & I'm rewarded for such a relationship. However, when I was heading back to the hotel after my afternoon stroll I received an alert on my Marriott App stating that my room was upgraded and I should stop by the front desk.

Funky Luxury Hotel in Brilliant Location,justalittlebitocd,"This hotel is truly fabulous!!!!  Everything is super quirky  / funky, even inside the lifts there is a light show which can be a bit trippy at first  Great central location  There was a mix up with our room as we booked through QANTAS but management quickly rectified the issue so we only spent one night in the wrong room so i can give feedback on two room types  Room 1 - deluxe club It’s not a very big room. Barely any space between end of the bed and the desk Overlook raffles which would be nice but it’s being renovated There is no lounge chair to relax in, it’s just a dining chair table with no cushion Not much storage room for clothes but we managed but we had nowhere to put our cases so they just got in our way in an already small room  Room 2 - premier marina bay view room…",5,September 2018,

Great hotel in great location,Ted Zaw,"Stayed for 6 nights. Rooms are really nice. Staffs attentive as usual( esp Angeline at reception and Laurence from house keeping) Location was good. Pool has a really great view of the city. Stayed in room 714. Had really good sleep most of the nights when there wasn't music being played loud near the hotel(Sounds like amateurs singing karaoke) but its not the fault of the hotel or the staffs. Overall, a satisfying stay.",5,October 2018,
Wonderful hotel property and first class service,Dan K,"Spent a week at this wonderful property.  We had club privileges and was not disappointed.  The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.  We were very close to all of the action and I would not hesitate to return here again if we get to return.    Truly one of the nicest places to stay.  I travel many times a year and a least once a year out of the US.  This hotel is one of the top three hotels I have ever stayed at.  Rooms are nice sized, and views from the rooms are very nice.  They have two infinity pools and numerous restaurants at South Beach to choose from.",5,October 2018,
Not worth money,53annie,I attended ITB Singapore 2018. I chose this hotel because I am MARRIOTT Fan. Club lounge and room - I stayed 712 were very disappointed. I understand that during city event room rate can be high but this room even included club lounge access would not worth 350 SGD but I paid 500+ SGD. As per hotel they regular turning fulled and higher floor has bigger room size. Haven’t seen upper floor by self however I would recommend  to stay in another hotels 5 Star Asia brand which are in same area which I found  more value and comfortable room,2,October 2018,
Above And Beyond Our Expectations,johnny99,"We booked this hotel as the final destination of our trip, circumnavigating the globe prior to returning home to Canada. From the moment we arrived we were greeted and treated like royalty. All the staff that we met went above and beyond. For our purpose of touring the city, the location was perfect. There was an entrance to the subway adjacent to the hotel, although we didn't use it. Instead, we found that for the price and convenience, taxis were the preferred mode of transportation.  Our room was located on the 12th floor of the West Tower. It had a king size bed and bathroom with a separate tub and walk in shower. Water pressure was great and there was no shortage of hot water.

Got most things wrong... Not at par with peers,239Robert,"Spending lots of time in Marriotts around the region I decided to try the new one in my hometown. All special room requests were missed out, an extra bed was added into my room without any ask, and the front desk took 15 min to answer the phone. Even funnier, when checking in there's a lady manning the queue rather than staffing up the counter (3 empty). Lounge staff is a bit naggy.  Seems like these guys have a lot of tuning to do before they hit the bar.  Nice building, ok rooms. ",3,October 2018,
really nice,shojiro07220,"It was fantastic stay here. Faculties and placement are excellent. Clerks here including HAZEL in executive lounge are always helpful and kind. Also, lounge menu vary every days, so you should use it. Would like to stay again.",5,October 2018,
Family Weekend @ JW,RAEnCHY,"JW Marriott.....   Its never an easy thing to review JWs. Since the mega purchase of Ritz & SPG, JW have been categorized as Classic Luxury, together with Ritz and St. Regis. You would expect JW to be of similar level with these 2, but in reality, its not quite the case. So, on one hand, a review on JW should be compared with Ritz & St. Regis, but on the other hand, most JW is not quite there and probably sits somewhere between Classic Luxury and Premium.    Back to JW South Beach - we stayed over the weekend with kids, using points to book for 2 nights and also tried upgrading using Suite Nights. Unfortunately, the Suite Nights were not granted, but did get an upgrade to Premium rooms with b'fast included. So, slight dissapointment here, but somewhat compensated with the…",4,October 2018,
"Excellent customer service, Marriott at its best!",magdalena m,"Being a Platinum member, I have stayed in many Marriott properties worldwide. My husband and I experienced three days of the best in customer service at JW Marriott South Beach in Singapore particularly at the Executive Lounge. The warmest welcome and genuine attention we received especially from Hazel and Jacqueline made our stay so much more enjoyable.  The views at the 18th floor and the service we received there were also quite impressive. The concierge desk and check-in staff were all helpful and gracious. The rooms were clean and well equipped. I highly recommend staying at JW Marriott if you wish to be treated like royalty in your next visit to Singapore! Jun and Allen",5,October 2018,

This was my third stay in less than two years..gets better each time !,Nauman B,"Lobby set up changed a bit from my last stay six months ago, but still looks fabulous..The Executive Lounge on the second floor seems to have hired more people & hence the service is very good; menu also expanded. The pool on the 18th floor with a view to die for & the ""coffee shop"" with the fantastic service is something that cannot be be replicated elsewhere in Singapore. But what essentially differentiates one great hotel from another is its people & here JW Marriott South Beach's people are outstanding.. they bend backwards to help you, & this applies to each & every department that I came in contact with...",5,September 2018,
Getting tired of screaming kids everywhere,YVR-BTR-BRC,"From the Executive Lounge riding razors and running around amongst the refreshments ... and the pool on the 18th floor there is no reprieve from screaming children running wild.   While the Marriott Group welcomes everyone ... they could benefit from accommodating family who are splashing screaming running around and acting wild ... to family friendly areas, and keep a few sacred spots for adults such as the executive lounge or pool deck with bar that caters to a loyal group of business travellers that need to conduct business and not feel like they are staying at a Holiday Inn ... on a cross country road trip.   I would upload the screaming video ... but honestly ... I don’t wish to relive this. It’s been going on for days.   ",2,October 2018,
Wonderful stay,Nam Nguyen,I stayed 3 nights at JW Mariott from 05/10 -08/10 . The room was very nice and has a spectacular view. Staff is very helpful and friendly.

"Unique interior, great service",Elizabeth Kay Nyigor,"The interior was pleasing to the eyes because it was unique, modern and very creatively curated.   Service was 10/10. My room was always clean, check out was quick and the staff were always ready to assist. I recall feeling unsafe walking back to my room one night (perils of being a lone female traveller), and the staff were more than helpful in offering an escort.  The rooms were clean, stocked with quality toiletries and tea. Unfortunately, it was rather small compared to some other hotels I've stayed in. Granted, I had a long corridor, but the room was generally quite small for a Marriott. Nevertheless, I'd highly recommend staying in this hotel if you have the chance, it was an experience ",5,September 2018,
Incredible Service,rdstrain,"The hotel was beautiful and the service from all staff was outstanding. One of the Ambassadors, Keith, always seemed to be nearby when we were in the lobby to help us with anything we needed, whether it was directions, recommendations for dining, baggage issues and check in/check out. He was always extremely pleasant, helpful and professional, but also seemed to really have the intention to take service to the next level. My 83 year old parents travel all the time and were constantly commenting on the great service he provided. Thanks to Keith and the entire hotel staff for making their 60th anniversary a great experience.",5,October 2018,
Great location but?,Wine dude,"Very strange hotel design. We are Platinum so got upgraded to deluxe suite. It’s like a maze of hallways within the room. Bad design. It’s like the W in my opinion. It’s not your typical JW that’s for sure. Hotel staff extremely nice and helpful and that means allot. The lounge is average food at best and quality needs improvement,but the breakfast buffet makes up for the lounge. If coming for business I find it great because location and the staff bend over backwards.  ",4,October 2018,

The hotel is also fairly new, very clean and luxurious.  From the time my wife and I arrived the staff really took care of us until our departure. The staff at this hotel really show that they care and always remember your name. Special mention to Sara who took care of every detail from Day 1.

Phenomenal Property,Windsor999,"Stayed here for one night, and was treated as a very special and welcomed guest.  I arrived very late in the evening and while I had communicated with the property prior to my arrival, I was pleased that my room was ready, upgraded and even had a small welcome treat waiting for me. The upgrade was incredible. When I got to my room I found that it was a large suite with a living room, bedroom, powder room and full bath. The room was sleek and well-appointed and while I was very tired from the long flight in I was excited to explore all the technological features the room had.

Formula 1 weekend,rrv,"I came here for Formula 1 weekend. I was surprised to find points availability for race weekend some three months out but so it was, and it is what kicked off the whole trip. As platinum I got upgraded to a Deluxe room and executive lounge access. Later on Typhoon Mangkhut made me add three more paid days in Singapore though only two of those at the JW for lack of availability for the 3rd. I could keep my Deluxe room for all five days which was nice.   I must mention the Toto toilet. Didn't expect one. Every time I use one I don't understand how much of the rest of the world does not.

The location is great for a tourist visit – centrally located for most of the main sights (such as Raffles and Gluttons Bay), right next to an underground station if you wanted to go further afield, and within 5-10 minutes walk from the main hub for the hop on/hop off tour buses which we used to orient ourselves in the city.

As they arrived on the redeye- we didn't expect their room to be ready quite yet and it wasn't. Staff there seem unable/unwilling to find someone who spoke Chinese for my guests, but perhaps it was just a misunderstanding. Room was comfortably sized and captured Singapore's skyline well. Lounge offerings were great but the lounge didn't offer any views. Location was great- it's in close proximity to several malls and there were nice restaurants/bars just below the hotel.  Check out was efficient and there weren't any erroneous charges.",4,August 2018,

Terrible stay - ruined my wife's birthday,Guy M,"Booked the JW Marriott for my wife's birthday. I booked a high floor with MBS view which I was charged extra for. When arrived the room was not ready, waited in lounge for more than 2 hours for the room, got the keys for the wrong room, the room we ordered and paid for was not available, staff was unprofessional, compensation that was offered was never received, a small gift for my wife that I ordered was only received late night (too late and not relevant anymore), etc.  It was one of the worst & most frustrating stays I ever had.

Awesome stay for the Singapore FORMULA ONE weekend,ChristianS_87787,"Very nice, very modern Marriott, very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel.  Rooms are large with full window front, couch and very comfortable beds We stayed 4 nights for the FORMULA ONE race weekend, great view of the Turn 7 of the race track right from the Hotels EBB6 pool and bar. We had a room on floor 20 looking towards the Marina Bay side with views of the financial district, the Bay, and the Marina Bay Sands / Gardens by the Bay .

Nice hotel but some area’s require improvement!!!,Samar Zaman,"Stayed at JW Marriot and our experience was ok, friendly and courteous service in hotel, the only thing which I didn’t like was the staff at break fast service area which was located opposite the hotel building but is a part of marriot only, waiters are pretty rude and service is very bad they listen to the customers and still act and behave as if they have not listened to the instructions which I have never experienced at any other hotel like Ritz,Sheraton or Fairmount, so I guess management needs to train them and make them understand that in service industry being polite and courteous to customers is very important, they do have a Japanese restaurant and there the waiters are very well behaved and trained and food is also good there, in room dining service is also good, since…",3,May 2018,
Worst Marriott hotel i had ever stay.,Cruiser163064,"For the past two years, I was trying to stay with the Marriott chain hotels. After the merger of the spg and Marriott/Ritz loyalty program, I found I had more choices with this brand.   But JW Marriott Singapore was probably the worst experience I ever had:  1.  Checked in.  I think the best experience I had with this hotel is the lady who helped us to check in.  At the beginning, the staff had some trouble to find our room as we request for a king size bed but somehow the record only show a twin size bedroom was booked for us.  After around 10 mins, the issue resolved and the staff was kind enough to explain the traffic situation (road conditions/arrangements during the f1 weekend) and what is the best way to go around the city during these peak time.    2. Room condition. …",1,September 2018,
Worst Customer Service Ever with JW Marriott Singapore !,ClarissRAY,"Worst Customer Service Ever!   1) Made a booking via online and sent my requests for a birthday celebration for my husband. Emailed and even called into the hotel reservations to ensure my requests were heard and taken note of. On the day of check-in at 5pm, the room was not ready and not prepared with the requests. Reminded the receptionist on the day itself about the birthday cake, which she acknowledged. But still it did not happen. The cake did come the next day at 11am, which was belated already. Emailed to the hotel about this, Rick Brennan, Marriott Guest Experience Supervisor, replied to say that only black and white reply from hotel will be accepted. If i did not receive black and white, I am not to assume the hotel will comply to my requests. However when i called the…",1,August 2018,

Very hip-hop and modern luxury with a few design issues,luxury-lizard,"We stayed for 2 nights then went to Indonesia for 4 nights then back for 1 night.   Firstly I was very happy with the hotel location - the building is very impressive with lots of ""out-there' design features. However there are a few design issues which were quite weird / annoying:-  - We booked a Premier Marina Bay room for both stays and the rooms allocated were quite different?? The first one - on the 13th floor was much larger (by about 25%) than the second but for some strange reason only one side of the bed had a night table - very inconvenient where you're a couple - we queried this and were told they could not provide one as there would be too much electrical work required and that rooms on all other floors did have 2 bed-side tables !!! - The Marina Bay view was a…",4,September 2018,

Comfortable Stay,Jiten Muni,"Hotel is located at the core of the city and well connected to the MRT Esplanade and City Hall.  I had the deluxe room which was SunTek facing, rooms are clean and neat but little small as compared to what Marriott standards are. There is very little space between the TV and the King Bed. I asked the hotel to change the room as the one allotted earlier had no view at all. Best is to take a higher floor with the City View.  Hotel staff was very nice and courteous. The hotel is almost fully occupied as it is a new one and the Marriott brand of course.  The infinity pool is a good and has a amazing view from the top.   Overall a good hotel to stay and go around the city. Recommended for Business Travelers.",4,September 2018,

Booked a premium room but given a deluxe room,HPJ,"The staff who attended to me seems inexperience.  She couldn’t direct me to the car park.  I booked a premium room but when I went to the room, it was a deluxe room.   When I went to the front desk, the staff asked me for the photos on the hotels.com website. I felt cheated as I had paid more for the premium room.  After a while, the staff said that her supervisor would change the room for me out of good will. I don’t understand this.  I paid for a premium room and if they have made a mistake, they should just admit it instead of saying the photos posted in the website did not reflect correctly (Deluxe room is for 2 persons; Premium room is for 3 persons.

Clean hotel and good breakfast that’s all,Kap95,"I’ve been there for one night, as platinum elite member I get suite upgrades on availability. At checking in us were told that the upgradable suites are fully booked. She offered me the executive suites 1332 and 1320. At first she wanted twice as much than for the other room, because one had a better view, I had to negotiate that and she didn’t charged more then. The room was fabulous no doubt, they used just good materials. A couple minutes later I checked the availability on the Marriott-website it was clearly showing, that they have a deluxe suite available. This is not okay for me, the hotel is just making a business with me what I can’t accept. The person just lied to me just for an upsell. Anyways the person who checked me in was not really friendly.

Good Location for Food Options,GlobeRunR,"While I visit Singapore, often, this was my first time staying here.  Much good, and a bump or two.  To start, the mirror are impressive.  My room was quiet, if not a bit tight with the desk chair.  Check-in was slower than I would have hoped for, in a very narrow lobby.  Food options in the attached mall are numerous for dinner, which is a plus.  I had a nice breakfast in the Executive Lounge, meeting partners there.  Staff were friendly.

We ate at the lounge for the first two nights, but the menu didn't have big difference which is quite boring.   On the third day, we were planning to go out for dinner instead but we then met Hazal. We asked her what the menu would be that night as we started to feel boring after the first two night. Very friendly, she asked us what we wanted to eat for that night.

It's also very close to some major shopping centers and plenty of food options within walking distance.

The entire team was fantastic, Jacqueline was so wonderfully accommodating by the time we have arrived until we have left. One of the service crews, Hazel, was soooo friendly and really gives a service that is all the way with extra extra mile — Niño, which happens to be the pork belly chef gives us that nostalgic feeling in every bite of his crispy fry pork belly.

From what we experienced here, that’s very unlikely.  This is a great-looking hotel. The building itself is striking and we enjoyed the decor, although some could say it’s a bit over the top. We had an executive floor room and were underwhelmed by the size. The bathroom was quite good, although the shower cubicle felt quite small. The bed was rock hard - instant sore hips and back. We’re used to beds being firm in Asia but this was just too hard for us.  We had executive club access on the second floor.

A chain series of unfortunate experiences which could have been prevented,Jamie,"We were assigned a room with someone still in it - which is totally unacceptable irregardless of how many stars a hotel is. The stay began with an mood dampening shouting from the guy in the room we were given, and we had to go down to check what was going on. Fortunately the guest of that room had double locked his door, otherwise we may have ran into a very awkward and hostile situation.   Following which, we were assigned a new room. Due to the shifting of rooms, our luggages which were supposed to be delivered to the previous room could not be found for half an hour.

The breakfast buffet was very good.  Would definitely stay again if ever in Singapore.",5,July 2018,
Brilliant location,Kkristen70,"Very nice hotel in the heart of the city. With all amenities expected. Pool, gym, billiard, table tennis, football table.  Spacious rooms in nice bright colors.  Good quiet sleeping conditions. Excellent restaurants nearby. ",5,August 2018,
Exceptionally wonderful stay at JW Marriott.,Kamaljeet K,"I booked the premiere suite overlooking Marina Bay Sands on the 11th of August 2018. The service quality left me with many positive emotions well beyond my thoughts, as such, I will summarize the entire experience of my stay with JW Marriott.  1. The room is spacious -  Probably one of the largest suite for its price tag complete with plenty of seating and an amazing bathroom (Instagram worthy) 2. Service staff are genuine and sincere - There are those who serve for the money and those who serve from the heart, JW Marriott staff members belong to the latter 3. Hotel Decor is amazing - The mix of conserved colonial buildings and contemporary art created a welcoming & relaxed atmosphere; not the kind that pressures you to leave with their deafening silence and empty atrium. …",5,August 2018,
Stopover,KtwjHam,"Hotel is nice in a great location. Breakfast is good and very busy. Although I think misinformed on breakfast (apparently we can only eat at club lounge ) the hotel were wonderful and helped us and explained the issue.   Booked  a club deluxe room - not huge but nice enough. For those of you that love looking at yourself in Mirrors - well you will love it mirrors everywhere - argh :-)   As for room bedding request - They did not pay attentions to the notes  notes when I requested a twin room - had to wait for them to change from a king to a twin. Again all sorted out very quickly.   Club lounge - wow Hazel is amazing, we came the first night apparently after they had finished cocktail hour not one person had bothered to explain this when we walked in looking for something as was…",4,August 2018,
Thank you Hazel for your wonderful service,angelaswt,"Amazing service in the Executive lounge. Hazel is a fabulous, she provides such a wonderful service with a welcoming smile, makes you feel right at home. First class effort Hazel, you have made our Singapore stopover such a delightful time.",5,August 2018,
8 days in August,phil e,"Fantastic hotel and lovely helpful staff. Great spa, pools and overall ambience. Very good  location next to Esplanade MRT metro and only 20 minutes by taxi to the airport; this made it easy for day trips to Malaysia, Indonesia, as well as seeing all that Singapore has to offer. A special mention for the excellent Executive Lounge and how welcome we were made to feel by everyone, especially Hazel. The concierge and reception desk staff were also very friendly and efficient. One of my favourite hotels anywhere. Thank you!",5,August 2018,
Impressive,paulz1980,Stayed over in this hotel for 1 nighg. Many  food and beverage outlets in the property for you to choose from. Hotel has two pools which are amazing   Concierge staff deborab and muzzafar was very friendly and welcoming. They make you feel at home and gave many recommendations for us to visit to understand singapore culture more. Even recommended us to take the hop on bus which was very convenient for us to visit in singapore,5,July 2018,
A pleasant stay,HanisAhmad,"I had a pleasant stay during the National Day break. We booked a premier marina may view suite for the 3 days 2 nights. The check-in process was a little confusing as the queue was literally all over. I had to approach the staff in order to know where the queue starts from.   Check in time was later than the stated timing, but staff was nice enough to let us have our rest at the executive lounge. The living space was awesome, room was clean enough and the bathroom was the bomb! My family managed to catch the fireworks from our hotel room.   The only downside was room keeper actually open our door for a turndown request. I was totally shocked to see her in our room at the entrance. So just imagine if you are getting ready near the living space, not expecting anyone, but the…",4,August 2018,
A pleasant change,Fofofthehorn,"Stayed three nights here in early August on the way back from Vietnam; first time at this property and overall impressed; the only issue was the check in- the lobby is fundamentally too small for the purpose and lent a slightly bad vibe to the start of the stay; from then on it was all upside; the lounge is a great facility, well worth the additional cost if you like a couple of beers in the evening and a good breakfast; staff all very friendly and competent; room was of good size, and location wise very convenient to walk to Marina Bay for the shops and Casino and the MRT uptown. Pools were good but slightly on the cold side and generally sunless; that said, great views.  Overall would stay again.",4,August 2018,
Delightful,Azreen N,"It was a super peak public holiday and I envisioned check in to be crazy. But it was handled so well. Staff are just so so nice. It was smooth and efficient.   The rooms are generously sized, nice roomy couch and it’s just beautiful. Kids called this the best hotel ever, which is high praise considering this lot are the biggest critics ;)  The lounge is excellent. Good spread of fresh juices, fruits, nibbles in the off hours. Again, staff made it amazing. Kwang made us feel right at home. The rest of the staff are equally friendly, remembered our names, etc.   Only downside was the rather small and freezing pool. But the view from there is awesome and the kids spent two hours there anyways. They also enjoyed the trippy lift lighting. Haha go figure.   Overall and enjoyable stay,…",5,August 2018,
"Wonderful hotel, amazing staff",Daleen C,"Our family met up in Singapore and stayed at the JW Marriott to celebrate our mum/nanny's 75th birthday. Our stay at the hotel was absolutely amazing with everyone going out of their way to look after us. The staff at the lounge always went above and beyond to meet all of our needs, a special mention to Hazel, Jaquelyn, Watson, Shah and Kwang as well a the rest of the wonderful team. The birthday cake was beyond delicious! Thanks Watson :) Thank you all for making our stay so enjoyable!",5,August 2018,
Friendly staff at Executive Lounge,Yoshihito T,Visited with my family for vacation. Ms. Hazel at Executive Lounge took care of us very much and talked to us very friendly. Thanks to her we could have some cozy time at the hotel. Room was not as big as expected but toilet was equipped washlet!!!!!! That automatic shower toilet is used everywhere in Japan but we hardly can find it abroad. We are very happy for that.,5,August 2018,
Excellent Stay at JW Marriott,Pat De Asis,"We stayed here for a birthday celebration. The location is right at the center of Singapore. There were a lot of guests checking in and out as it was a long weekend in Singapore so the lobby was really busy. They should have opened more counters when they saw the crowd.  Also, their hotel lobby itself is a bit confusing. But nonetheless, our overall staycation experience was still great. Our room was big enough, and the club lounge was exceptional. The staffs at the club lounge were very accomodating, special thanks to Hazel and Jollie for making us feel very special. Would definitely come back again",4,June 2018,
Beautiful hotel,angExplorer,"The hotel is gorgeous, from the front desk to the rooms to the pool... however there is still some minor imperfections. It is a bit more edgy than the regular JW Marriotts but I kind of like it. Front desk seems a bit chaotic everyday with over 600 rooms.  Although JW South Beach is technically opened in end 2016, it operated under a independent brand for 1-2 years and you can really start to see some minor wears in the rooms. Rooms is well designed and has some of the best amenities from TWG teas to Aromatherapy Associates (my favorite brand of amenities ever.) They do offer some welcome fruits on arrival, however they are really on the more exotic Asian side, perhaps some bananas, apples, kiwi might be a better option?  Being a gold elite (until 18 August 2018) allows us to…",4,July 2018,
Staycation and birthday celebration,Venessa L,"Impressive service received when I was attended by the proactive bellboy at the drop off point lobby which he took initiative to hold my luggage. He even arranged a concierge service assistant for my check-in.  One of the Chinese gentleman who wore a spect has assisted me on preparing my room key is very friendly and warm. The check-in process is so simple and convenient using the Marriott App. He even make an exceptional to delay my check-out time to 1 pm even though the hotel is fully occupied due to the national day.  Furthermore, the spa services rendered by Yok, the masseur is commendable. She noticed that I was unable to unlock the locked locker, she took the initiative to get the security guard to assist me with the lock immediately. Asides from this, she and her partner…",5,August 2018,
Beautiful hotel with extremely helpful staff,NevilleMavis,We stayed here on a business conference for 5 nights from 30 July and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful.  Check in was a breeze and the room was spacious and spotlessly clean.  The toiletries were always replenished and there was more than enough water for us both. They left some chocolates on the pillow at night when they were doing the turn down service and although I didn’t eat them (my husband did!!) I think it is a really nice touch.  We ate at the restaurant for breakfast each morning and there is so many things to choose from that there should be something for everyone. We had a party on the rooftop and the staff were very attentive. We also had lunch at the same restaurant as breakfast and it was equally delicious with the most amount of seafood I have seen at…,5,August 2018,
"Great location, hotel experience",BluedogTraveler,"The JW Marriott is a great property. We arrived at 01h30 and given a small glass of lemonade while they checked us in.  Beautiful lobby and of course whole building/hotel.    They upgraded us to a higher floor with a good view (though most views are probably good).   As a Marriott Gold we had access to the Executive Lounge though Aug 1, 2018 that changes to only for Platinums.  Executive Lounge buffet breakfast is def good enough. There's snacks in the late afternoon and then a wine/more food tasting in the evening.  Favorite part was the 18th floor (or was it 17th?) where you have a beautiful outdoor pool with a view of the Marina Bay area, workout room, bar, billiards, and plenty of room to just sit and relax. But, it is pretty hot/humid even at 2 a.m. so it's best to be ready…",5,July 2018,
Trendy new hotel with excellent location,Natalie N,"This is one of the more modern looking JW Marriott properties we’ve stayed in and we loved the quirky design elements of the hotel! Service was pleasant and efficient, however staff on the ground floor didn’t seem as proactive compared to other hotels. The hotel is located right in the city centre, with an MRT station just a 3 minute walk away! There is also plenty of great food choices at South Beach. Overall, lovely stay in the city and we hope to return again. ",4,October 2017,
Very so-so for a JW Marriott,silmoonver,"Breakfast line was long, and items run out... In my last stay, there was a power outage... Was stuck in my room with no aircon, and could not even go down from my level (as the lifts were not working)... Have never experienced this in a 5-star hotel. Atrocious!",3,July 2018,
Cozy room with a view,TheGreenGatsby,"An excellent new Marriott property near the Marina.   Get a downtown-facing room for the view of your life.  Marriott really went above an beyond on this property, not missing a single detail or touch of luxury.  The in-room bathtubs are amazing. And be sure to check out the 18th floor pool deck. It doesn't get great sun, but the bar and view will keep you entertained all day if you so choose.   This hotel makes it hard to leave to go explore the city as it's just a great place to chill.",5,July 2018,
Mr Kiran Sanghavi,Kiran S,The excellent hospitality. As Me & my wife are vegetarian & requested for vegetarian food & the executive lounge staff have given us very excellent hospitality & more particularly chef C Y & Hazel arranged for us excellent Indian vegetarian dishes in jiffy’s time & that too different dishes at every meal & that too the best Indian food We ever had abroad. Excellent hospitality.,5,August 2018,
Very modern refurbishment,Patinessex,"We stayed here for several days in January 2018.  Apparently the hotel has been refurbished very recently and the style is modern, possibly at the expense of comfort in some instances.  The staff were pleasant enough but there was no sense of  truly friendly personal welcome.  It is very handy for the hop on hop of buses though and is in a very good location generally.",3,January 2018,
Efficiency all around,asoloist,"We were here on a business trip, and this hotel worked well for that purpose although the pool is something else - definitely worth a plunge if you have the time or are on vacation. It has the most spectacular view of the CBD and the Cricket Club.  Service was excellent, especially given the hotel size/capacity. The room I was assigned was a Premier Room, and there was so much space - enough for proper yoga. There were also black-out blinds to help manage the sun and, more importantly, the heat coming through the room-wide windows. The bed was super comfortable, and everything was spotless. There are the usual: safe, wide-screen tv, fridge and snacks/plenty of bottled water.  The bathroom was the highlight with a separate bath and a stand-alone standing shower with rainfall…",4,June 2018,
Very bad experience....,Lawrence C,"This is a trendy new hotel with small rooms. It's very busy with tourists and conference goers. I had a very bad experience with this hotel staying there the very first time, probably my last time. I booked a room weeks in advance and did on-line check-in accordingly. I arrived at the hotel 3pm and it's like a zoo. I had to wait for check in again in the executive lounge and then waited for the room. The staff couldn't tell me how long I had to wait except smile and apologise and the lounge was chaotic. Finally they gave me the keys to my room with apologies and told me it's a very very nice room. That's the killer. The room was the smallest JW Marriott room I ever stayed and was on the lowest level next to the elevator facing Suntec Mall !!  Btw, I'm a life time Platinum Member…",1,August 2018,
Simply the best with top notch service,serenehosl,"I have stayed in this hotel in April and I have written a lengthy review about the wonderful room, the  fantastic facilities and the superb location of the hotel so I will not dwell too much on that. Suffice to say that the hotel takes care of every tiny, painstaking detail to ensure that the rooms are comfortable and the buffet breakfast is one of the best I have been to. This is the only hotel I have been to that serves chicken rice for breakfast and they have even special Asian fusion omelettes are char siew and rendang omelettes.   I would like to focus on the service of the staff in this review. The staff here really take pride in their work and they are friendly  and attentive to guests.

"Good location, great service, nice design",deb0rahparkes,"This  was our second trip to Singapore and JW Marriott South Beach was in a much more central location to our previous visit. It is near the Marina area and right across from the Hop on, Hop off bus, which makes getting around the city easy. The hotel itself is relatively new and the decor is modern and fresh. It is interesting to look at the art work throughout the hotel. The main thing that struck us was the friendliness and willingness to help of all the staff from porters to waiters, from housekeeping to reception. Hazel in the Executive Lounge was a breath of fresh air! She was there to greet and help you at breakfast and was still as cheerful in the early evening. She was very helpful with information of where to go and how to get to places. Our room was very well kept,…",4,August 2018,
Nice hotel conveniently location,Glentc,"Not our choice of hotel as this was part of a conference and extended holiday so hotel was chosen for us for a 8 day visit and what a great choice this was. The hotel is very modern, the room we had was large with all the modern conveniences, the decor bordered on glitzy glam but thankfully only just enough to not offend. The room was comfortable and quiet with views of the city. The service can only be described as brilliant, from entering the hotel to the people looking after the cleaning of your room, nothing was to much trouble, staff always respectful and eager to help. We only ever had breakfast in the hotel which offered a large and excellent choice of cuisines to satisfy every palate so can’t comment on the other dining options of which there were plenty. The hotel is…",5,August 2018,

I would like to compliment the staff here,especially, Hazel who was a total delight. Friendly and helpful at all times, but also honest. My husband had put cash in his pocket rather than in his wallet. This slipped out, and it was Hazel who quickly advised us , that this had occurred. To the management, this is one employee who you really need to utilize, she is a  Great ambassador for the hotel",4,July 2018,
"Excellent location, above MRT station, fantastic views from room, upgrade to get Executive Lounge access",Leanne M,"We loved our 5 nights in  Singapore. JW Marriott is across the road from Suntec City Hub, so you can get the tourist hop on hop off buses there, which we used for 2 days. Then we purchased a MRT ticket at 7 Eleven which cost $10 and gives you $5 credit for travel, you then top it up at the machines, minimum top up is $10. The trains are fantastic, so efficient and clean. The hotel is above the Esplanade MRT station on the circle line. We paid to upgrade our room, and were given room 1918 which had excellent views, looked over city, war memorial, and across to Marina Bay Sands. If you were staying for Grand Prix, bring binoculars and watch it from the room. On level 18;below us is the pool, and a great area to sit and have a drink and enjoy the views also.

"Modern design, but too modern for me?",Alex C,"I traveled to Singapore to attend a friend's birthday party which took place at One Fullerton Road. After a search for a hotel near by, I landed in JW Marriott. when I arrived, i was very impressed by the entrance and the building exterior, particularly the spacious surrounding which is covered by a huge canopy. when I entered the main entrance, a huge screen with moving and colourful image was there to greet me and gave me a unique way of welcome. Then I walked through a long narrow space which is the reception area which I ended up walking through daily in the midst of hotel guests with their luggage. Not a good design. then we were told when checking in that the room was not ready, but it was almost 6 pm. Luckily, we got in our room not too long after that to find the room…",4,August 2018,
Great location,Simon A,Did a few days sight seeing and relaxing in Singapore. Hotel is well located between Marina Bay sights and Orchard shopping. Also next door to the main terminal for the Hop On and Off bus tour helped us get our bearings on the first day. Very helpful reception and concierge.  Only downside was the bar and restaurant was fiendishly expensive. We ended up buying some wine at a local supermarket for 10th of the price having said that breakfast was excellent. Great base for sight seeing as there are so many amazing places to eat and explore in Singapore.,4,August 2018,
"Employees are super nice, friendly and warm",Schacko,"The hotel is relatively new and the facilities are great. The lounge is nice with a good spread of food items in the evening. I am specifically writing this to compliment few exceptional customer service oriented employees i met in the lounge. Ms. Jollie Anne Reventar, the greeter is very kind, smiling always and super helpful. When I checked in to the hotel, she helped me rest and get a drink while she made all the arrangements to get my luggage, checking in etc. Another nice employee was Ms. Esther, she was tending the bar in the lounge. She was also friendly and smiling and making the all the customers feel welcome. Overall, people like this make a difference when you are staying at a place that is not your home. Thank you Marriott for employing people like this.",5,July 2018,
"Wonderful staff, pleasant stay, good location ",TCKLY,"We spent 2 nights at the JW Marriott as a family of 3, including a toddler.  The hotel building is very beautiful, the hotel itself is more to a contemporary design. It also has a good location - Suntec City, Marina Square and Esplanade MRT all a short walk away.  We used the online check in facilities offered by the app, before our flight. Upon arrival, the concierge team took care of our luggage from the taxi right to our room. The online check in is a great service that our room was already waiting for us at the reception, so we can go to our room straight away.  The lifts felt a little odd to us, where the lights kept changing colors. The room is of a good size, and kept very clean each day. The stool provided in the bathroom was particularly useful for our toddler. The bed…",4,June 2018,

Special mention to Hazel and Chef Junkiat who went out of their way to see we were looked after.  Good view from our room.  Best views however from the pool levels.

It had the best view of the chinook carrying the Singapore flag and fireworks looks nice at most hotels with marina bay view. Should the NDP be at the Padang, would be even more exciting!  We checked in late as we had to feed our going-to-20 month old daughter at a restaurant nearby first. Didn't want to risk waiting with a hungry baby.

The staff at executive lounge kept saying they are checking if our room is ready but they never get back to us, we had to keep asking them. I understand they are experiencing high occupancy but to wait for 3hrs is just unacceptable for a JW Marriott hotel. The following Sunday apparently there was a fire or something, fire engines came.

Great location, love the design, however very underwhelming service.  We checked out Media Bar for dinner on our first night, not a single soul when we entered. And it was a Friday night. Maybe that should have been a sign not to dine there. Not much of a selection but food was sub par to say the least. When we asked ask for the bill, the waitress asked “credit card promo or staff?” Which was a very strange question to ask. I didn’t know of a credit card promo so shouldn’t she tell me more/ask if I have the relevant cc?

I have to say the hotel is strategically located and convenient especially when you are planning to travel around the Bay Area. The hotel and the room is trendy with great interior design, however, we found the housekeeping service quality is just fair and sorry that it’s below par as a worldwide brand like Marriott.

Excellent Service,Joan S,We had an excellent stay here in JW Marriot. Special mention to the lounge staff provided to us by Ms Jaquelyn and Ms Hazel. They’re very friendly and accommodating to our needs. I will highly recommend this hotel to my friends going to Singapore 🙂,5,July 2018,
Great,Keith,"Stayed for a one night staycation while taking part in a nearby run . We knew this hotel is new , and having stayed in some JE Marriotts before, I know this hotel will have some quality. I’m not disappointed . Room is new and nice. Hotel is very modern in design . The room we had on the 16th floor kind of overlook a in-house garden, so the view wasn’t great. Service is friendly and good. What really pleases me is the location . Easily accessible to the MRT stations , you can walk in the sheltered underpass to the nearby Marina square, Suntec city or to raffles city. Much more convenient to these places than the other nearby hotels. ",5,July 2018,
I've given up on this hotel,Mike A,"I've given this hotel many chances (4 multi night visits) but I can no longer stay there. I seem to always have an issue with the rooms I'm in. The first time the toilet didn't work and the temp never got to where it was comfortable. The room was also ridiculously small. Second time, no issues so giving it another chance. Third time, I had a non-smoking room but at some point during the night my room filled with cigarette smoke so bad that even the maintenance crew was shocked. A few hours, yes hours, later they moved me to a floor where you couldn't be in during the day due to construction of a new awning outside. Good fun. Because I'm a glutton for punishment I decided I'd give it one more go. This time the ac vent from my room creating this deep rumbling noise that I…",3,July 2018,

Awesome Staff,Randy J,"My wife and I visited the JW app had nothing but a most incredible visit.  We would especially like to recognize Sid,  the executive chef as well as Melvin the executive lounge host, Hazel, that always welcomed us with a smile on her face and all the rest of the staff in the restaurant and lounge.    The food variety was always changing and very tasty. Said always went the extra mile to take the time to make sure we were taken care of and would do anything in his power to make us feel welcome and needed.  The JW is in a very convenient location and walking distance too many of Singapore is attractions.  The rooms are very clean and the staff take pride in making sure you have everything.

Convenient location and great service,HL L,"Stayed here for almost 2 weeks and it was a great experience for me and the team. At first I was a little concerned about the distance to city hall mrt as we have to walk there every day to get a train to our office. However, I soon found out that my worries were unfounded. It was a breeze to stroll underground (with air con).   The rooms in general are not big but adequate. However, I have an issue to have the TV right in front of the work desk. As I have a habit of having some sounds in the room while i work, my eyes were very tired from the flashing of the tv (as it is literally arm's length from me) after a few hours. Lots of eateries within the vicinity at raffles city and suntec. Tried the room service a couple of times and I think it is just okay, nothing to shout about. …",4,May 2018,
Executive Lounge Staff make the difference,Tony S,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the JW Marriott South Beach - Singapore for 10 days in June / July. Access to the Executive Lounge provides for an effort free way of having breakfast and relaxing at the end of a long day.  Each evening either Sous Chef CY or Chef Dharma would cook a gluten free meal for us, with the dish changing very evening. The service at any hotel is something that allways leaves a lasting impression on a guest and Hazel who works in the Executive Lounge made sure we were well looked after every day. I love to cook (I am fortunate to have my Singapore food handling certificate) and Sous Chef CY gave me a cooking lesson in the Beach Road restaurant kitchen, on how to cook the local dish Char Kway Teow",4,June 2018,
Great staff!,rahhhhh,"I spent 3 nights at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach with my family.   All of the staffs I met there were super helpful, the food from the executive lounge and Beach Road Kitchen were amazing and the pool and other facilities were great as well.

The elevator has this cool design that changes light to different colors, like you’re in a space ride or something. Haha! Bed is super nice and comfortable not to mention their feather pillows. It makes you want to stay in!  Gym is good too and you get an amazing view of the city.  Location is very convenient! It is connected to malls (Suntec, Raffles), anything you need is nearby.   Always the best part of our Marriott stay is the executive lounge. Very warm and super accommodating staff! They make sure you have what you need. Look for Hazel or Jaq when you visit, I guarantee they will take good care of you! Overall, I would love to stay here again!",5,July 2018,
Getaway,cathy B,"Had a wonderful time in Singapore during a four night getaway with my best friend. Fortunately we were lucky to stay at the Marriott hotel south beach through a luxury escape deal.

Wedding Anniversary Staycation,Alan T,"Decided to give JW a try for our wedding anniversary celebration. We got ourselves an Executive suite with the Marina Bay view.   The rooms were nicely decorated, with good considerations of effective use of space for very functional usage. The marina view was great.  We enjoyed the pool view at both level 6 and 18. We managed to spend a relaxing afternoon out in the pool.  The executive lounge was a bit of the disappointment. The tea break spread was rather limited and lack of the ""grab and go"" snacks. The couches and sofa  cleaniness would definitely need improvements. Can see leftover crumbs, stains. Other than that, the service staff were all very friendly and always serving with a smile.   Overall, it was a great staycation.",4,July 2018,

They even did a quick housekeeping for us while we were out for dinner!   Do check out the swimming pool at 18th floor. View is stunning, just a little bit cold due to the strong wind. There is bar there for u to order drink.   They also had a gd variety of buffet breakfast, just that the staions are spread everywhere. Need to walk around to find the food you want.

Service is great but upgrade your room!,Jdruglord,"After reading all the great reviews, my expectations were high for our stay in this hotel. Unfortunately the room we were given is so small, it was literally a box! The bathroom area is the same size as the rest of the room! We enjoyed the hotel much more once we paid for an upgrade to the more expensive rooms. I also mistakenly thought it was a newish hotel. It is actually an old hotel that has been taken over by Marriot. The hotel shower heads spray water at odd angles and some parts of the room show its age. The executive lounge was nice but coffee machines kept breaking down. One day, both machines were not working! The best thing about the hotel is the customer service. Reuben at the front desk is a true gentlemen and was so super helpful- he is a gem! The other positive is…",3,July 2018,

The service and the helpfulness  of the staff is first class. Specially staff at executive club. We meet Hazel at the club who always serves as with smile and care. She enjoys what she is doing. She is one of the few people  you meet them in the morning and make your day meaningful. I would definitely come back and recommend JW Marriott in Singapore without any doubt  Yeshi,5,July 2018,
Excellent choice,unvalerie,"Location wise, Marriott South Beach is  linked to Esplanade MRT, and Suntec City mall where you can go shopping, watch movies or dine out. Very ideal for people who like modern design and technologies, the rooms are equipped with IPTV system and Blum hardware.  Apart from its large rooms and instagram-worthy decors, the reason why I kept coming back here is the people, particularly the staff at the Executive Lounge. A big shout out to Hazel who cheerfully greets and talks to guests like as if she has known them for years. She remembers the name of the guests and creates small talks with them. Her hospitality and rapport are commendable which I hope Marriott will recognise.   Another favourite of mine is the swimming pool, where you can have a panoramic view of the city skyline.…",5,July 2018,

Superb Stay,_sylve_yu,I and my boyfriend always stay in JW Marriott South Beach whenever we are in Singapore for his business. This time we are staying for a week until this Sunday.   From cleanliness of the place (room is always kept clean) to how accomodating the staffs are are just great and coundn't find anything to complain.  My favourite is the lounge where there are wide selection of foods and drinks. All fresh and delicious. Special thank you to the very good Chefs; Chef Jacky and Chef Shah.

From an unexpected early checkin (a day before schedule) to late checkout and everything in between. Stella personally escorted me to the Lounge while I waited for my room to be ready for my early check in then escorted me up to my room when it was available. Melvin bent over backwards to work out ways he could assist me offering a variety of suggestions as to what I should do during my time in Singapore and sourced information for us. Kwang was very personable too. The whole stay was most enjoyable and it is the staff that made a difference in this hotel.",5,July 2018,

Unforgettable Experience for me and my family,Chris D,"We stayed in this property early July 2018. The hotel itself was amazing, close to most of our tour itinerary spots like the Main Station of the Bus tour we took was just across the street and the rest was just a short cab ride away, which I really appreciated. The room that we had was beyond what what I expected; stylish, clean and well taken cared of; lots of natural light and designed with comfort, practicality and aesthetics combined. The caliber of their service was maintained high from the moment we stepped out of our cab arriving to us going to the airport leaving after checking out. The a la carte and buffet at beach road kitchen was tasty, if not on the pricey side. The Executive lounge is a good alternative for someone looking for a quick but quality bite in the…",5,July 2018,

Glad we stayed here...not sure we'll be back though,pace_03,"Stayed here for our first time in Singapore. The location was excellent, MRT right below hotel, the view from our room and the pool deck was amazing... but that's about it. Considering when we stayed the hotel was only just on 12mths old the rooms had gotten a workout. Our electronic blinds didn't work initially but we got them working, then our TV stopped working (2 techs, 2 remotes, a pulled apart tv and finally got it working again after an hour or so), then on 2nd night our bath plug (one that pushes flat into the bath shell) wouldn't stay secured and kept popping up. Sent same tech that fixed the tv and he had to replace the plug...awesome...but short lived. Next day plug did the exact same thing...so no bath again.

Great property but probably won’t be back,HK_Traveller05,"The greatest thing about the hotel is the location, and the view from the room, which enticed me to come back after not so pleasant experiences in the past. Compared to 1 year ago, the hotel has definitely picked up in terms of guest count and the services offered. Due to this, however, the lobby is way too cramped with luggage being stored everywhere, and people not knowing where to queue and where to wait. You could potentially be seen as cutting in line. That, however, is not a deal breaker for me.   The deal breaker for me is really the room and the journey coming up. I got stuck in the elevator due to a card malfunction, alone, and it was very unnerving with the dark LED. Once you are in the room, I hope you have enough lights on as the printed artworks would give you major…",3,July 2018,

When I was out, they surprise me with a call to say they have arranged for a room change. When I returned to check out my room, I was greeted with a Premier room with floor to ceiling views of Marina Bay. Kudos to the team for their wonderful service.

Modern and trendy hotel in city centre,limericklin,"1. Location   The location is unbeatable. It is right smack in the city centre and a short walk away from City Hall MRT / Esplanade MRT. Raffles City Shopping Centre is also a 7-12 minutes walk away. There is no lack of eating options in the area.   Yummy gummies were placed near the entrance and what a pity we only saw it on the last day because these gummies were delicious.  The check in was fast and the lobby exuded a modern flair. The lifts were a little psychedelic, with the colours of the lights changing frequently.  3.

Disappointed,CarolT_SG,"As this was a wedding anniversary staycation which my husband and I try to do every year, I will compare this with past stays at Fullerton, Ritz Carlton Singapore and W hotel Sentosa. Granted JW Marriott South Beach is the newest 5-star hotel in town, building has an eye-catching curved glass design, facilities are spanking new and the room is well-equipped, nothing scratched or broken and bed is firm and very comfortable. Service during check-in and check-out was also impeccable. That’s about all the praise I can sing for this hotel.

"Tiny room size, poor quality executive lounge",ASemiRegularTraveller,"This trendy hotel is obviously trying to target a specific demographic.  I clearly don't fit the demographic.  The layout of the hotel is trendy.  The artwork is trendy.  (Clearly I'm not trendy).  The design of the tiny deluxe room is cool.  So cool that it felt like there was a mirror on every surface due to the sheer number of metallic or mirror surfaces they had throughout the room.  The width of the hallway is dramatic, and the layout of the bathroom is poor - so much so that there was barely enough room to walk around the bed in the room and one of our suitcases was kept in the hallway for the duration of our stay because there was nowhere else to put it.

Modern design and great hospitality,Marcus L,"We stayed at the JW Singapore for three nights. The rooms were very modern and clean with stunning views. We had access to the executive lounge which offered delicious food - from continental to traditional. The drinks were great too and the staff were beyond fantastic. The check in process was smoothly executed by Keith, who, despite being an intern, was extremely professional and polite. He even noticed that my friend’s birthday had been a couple of days ago and sent us a birthday cake to the room. What a surprise! The infinity-edge pool on the 18th floor is amazing. The only two points of improvement are: the Media Bar is not the greatest when it comes to cocktails and food. It’s mediocre and bar food quality.

The drapes can be controlled electronically for a total blackout (and improved sleep!) in the room. The fabulous bidet in the spacious bathroom is also fully electronic.

Take care fraud on credit cards,Franco,I had a very good stay in this hotel. Unfortunatele after about a week from my leave the hotel charged me about 2200 dollars without any notice. The hotel contacted by the tourist agency where I bought my stay responded that they haven’t charged anything. My bank unfortunately confirmed the amount and that this amount was charged by the JW Marriott Singapore south beach! So now I have to pay this amount.

We have booked for two nights of staycation for the date of 21st and 22nd of June. Booking made 1 week before with no payment made yet. However, my young toddler had an accident right after the next day we made the booking. As he was in cast and in great pain, he definitely was not able to enjoy the staycation and the entire family was in a distress situation, we called to cancel the booking but was rejected by a flat 'No' from the management. We even showed proof with pictures and medical certificates but the management…",1,June 2018,
Excellent service and good breakfast!,MichelleChanHL,"Stayed 1 night to celebrate my friend's birthday. As soon as i reach the lobby, was greeted by the reception staff. He was very helpful in helping out with my luggage and brought me to the counter for check in. Excellent service!  I requested for twin bed. Room is clean facing suntec city. There is a working desk and a large sofa by the window. Bathroom is very spacious and has a bath tub. Toilet is fully automated. Shower gel smells great and the conditioner is so smooth for the hair.  There is a swimming pool and a kids pool on level 18. Might be the design, not much sunlight gets to the pool so the water tends to be cold. On the other hand, very nice view from the pool. Good for photo taking. Gym is also on level 18.  Room service is very prompt. Hotel even delivered a small…",5,July 2018,
Best staycation if not best suite room,Fiona N,"Our family was stayed in the suite for a short staycation. Check in was fast, service was alright. The size of the suite is the most generous we have stayed ( comparable to Capella suite ), and I love the decor of the suite and the whole hotel, it's fun and quirky and those unique designer furnitures they use... the all white concept bathroom, the club lounge. There were 2 pools but both was slightly too small and the walkway was kinda narrow so when the water splashed onto the ground it was quite slippery and dangerous as my baby slipped when walking. Also, The food taste can be improved ( both room service and breakfast ). But it still I love almost everything about the hotel. It will be our fam's best choice when we were looking for suite room for staycation.",5,July 2018,
My stay at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach,ardee6263,"My stay at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach was phenomenal from mobile check in through my access at the executive lounge. I was taken care very well by all filipino’s namely Hazel,Jollie,Jaq and Honey they all went above and beyond to their service and I  was thankful and very appreciative for all what they do, KUDOS to all the filipino’s in Singapore whenever you go they excelled in customer service.",5,June 2018,
Best Staycation Experience,Hilary Jane Tay,"JW Marriott Hotel best impression will be their staffs, we were being greeted and the check-in was fast. The hotel is located near the central and it's very convenient for travelling. Hotel facilities are amazing, especially the gym please check it out when you're there! The hotel scent is unique, my partner wend to check if can be purchased haha. It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!",5,June 2018,
Worst hotel experience ever,Stu,"I came to the Marriott with high hopes based on recommendations.  Great location and the hotel looked fantastic from the website and reviews.  This was not to be. The check in process was crazy, which I can easily forgive. But not the room. First, the power points would not work and secondly the doorbell would go off at all hours of the night, making me jump out of bed, thinking someone was at the door. This happened twice on first night, and then on the further nights. I complained, and nothing was done about this for 3 days! Despite repeated complaints. And there was no feedback from staff as to whether it had been fixed, nor was there any apology. It has left a very bad impression and I am unlikely to stay Marriott again. There are better options out there.",1,June 2018,
June 2018 stay,janrotterdam2,"This is a real magnificent hotel! Location perfect, close to restaurants, shopping malls and - important - easy access to the mrt (metro) system. All reachable through underground walkeable areas. The hotel has two swimming pools, which are great. For frequent guests there is the Exec lounge, where breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks are served. Extremely friendly employees. The rooms are good and spacious.  I have stayed here several times and each some employees walk the extra mile. This stay I was impressed by Sara, the Indian doorman. He always correctly anticipates your next wish. He is really a jewel at the doir. Another employee at the Reception area - Keith - was more than making sure his guests were comfortable.",5,June 2018,
Impressive,Dan,Price: Reasonably priced for offerings. Room: Decent size depending on which layout you get Location: Centrally located beside Esplanade metro. Walking distance to City Hall metro. Food options plentiful. Inhouse food option: Lounge spread was ok. Pool: 2 pools at level 6 and 18 to choose room.Level 18 does not have any sun.,5,January 2018,
Love the executive lounge,Brandtgil,The service at the JW is amazing... you will feel welcome from check-in to check-out. I want to mention Hazel Shanice who was an angel during our stay at the hotel. Her dedication to her guests’ satisfaction was impeccable!! I’d be back any time. Thank you!,5,June 2018,
Exceptional,Monticat1,"Despite a bit of a hiccup with our booking the delightful Stella was able to find us a great room with the minimum of fuss. I would have to say that ALL the staff at this hotel were magnificent (particularly the club lounge), always greeting the guests with a smile and a warm welcome. The hotel has a huge selection of rooms to suit all budgets with a couple of pools in which to cool off. It is a large sprawling hotel with plenty of restaurants and bars within the hotels grounds. It is perfectly located with easy access to parks and gardens, department stores and of course, the beautiful downtown precinct as well. This would have to be one of the best hotels in Singapore and I would definitely return on the next visit to this wonderful city. ",5,June 2018,
Luxurious spot,Sharron N,End of a great holiday for us. Lovely room with a huge chaise lounge and gorgeous bathroom. Thanks to the lovely Hazel for going out of her way to look after us in the Club.....so hospitable. The deck is simply the best outlook in Singapore.,5,June 2018,
great hospitality,Molly K,"The rooms are great, and come with such nice touches like bath salts and chocolates. The bath tubs looked amazing although I didn't get a chance to use one. The hospitality of the staff could not be better!  I was very impressed.",5,June 2018,
Nice room,JPandJen,Lovely bright and spacious room and bathroom. Super comfy bed and spotlessly clean. Good desk area for working and nice view. Food was a let down but we were there with a huge group so I imagine that was the problem.,4,May 2018,
Beautiful hotel great location,Frank,"Stayed here for business on my trip through Singapore, the hotel is in a great location very close a lot of fun attractions in downtown Singapore!  modern clean and great service, the staff went beyond the call of duty to return some clothing that I left at their hotel, very grateful!",5,June 2018,
Breadlines,WKKHKQ,"Our friend had her wedding dinner at the hotel and we flew in for a one-night stay (23 Jun 2018). We were given an early check-in and a late check-out, the room was more than pleasant, and most members of staff were very polite and helpful.  The only unsatisfactory experience we had was at breakfast the following morning (24 Jun) at Beach Road Kitchen. There was already a line of some 20 people in front of the restaurant when we arrived at the restaurant at about 9.30 in the morning, and we waited for about 45 minutes before we were seated. While we understand that busy periods are unpredictable and inevitable, the hotel ought to have a contingency plan for situations such as the one just described, such as opening up more tables, temporarily increasing manpower at the…",4,June 2018,
"Beautiful hotel, perfect location.",Natalie F,"My partner was in Singapore on business and I was lucky enough to enjoy the hotel and its location throughout the day. The pool is beautiful! The staff are so friendly and I was offered a late checkout for a flight, it makes such a difference. An amazing gym, always clean, bottled water,towels and new machines and weight equipment. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else. If you do need to work from the hotel you may need a bigger room as the workspace was confined - however, not a complaint, just a suggestion for those booking! ",5,June 2018,
"Outstanding staff, location and views from this JW Marriott",Claire F,"We recently stayed at this property as part of our recruitment trip to live in Singapore. The Executive Club is exceptional with food and beverages offered throughout the day. It is worth the extra money to pay for executive club level access. The outdoor infinity pool rivals Marina Bay Sands. And you are close to the MRT so you can get about Singapore easily from this property. And you are close to the tourist attractions like Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay as well as an easy MRT to Orchard Room shopping. And for business travelers, you are convenient to the CBD (Central Business District).",5,December 2017,
Magnificent Hotel,Mick0072013,"Stayed here for three nights June 2018. Encountered problem on arrival where Luxury Escapes on-line travel agency had misrepresented/misled their offer by booking two single beds on one base (unable to separate) instead of a twin bed configuration. After providing emails confirming twin accommodation from both the Hotel and Luxury Escapes I expressed my concern with the duty manager, Stella I think, who immediately upgraded us to a magnificent suite with sweeping views of the City. Despite the Hotel being ideally located for so many attractions within walking distance, offering magnificent facilities, I have never encountered such wonderful, friendly, helpful and professional staff in every position. I will definitely stay here on return and can honestly recommend this to…",5,June 2018,
One of my favorite hotels. Great executive lounge and rooms with amazing view.,Adriana P,"Singapore is indeed an amazing city. Modern, clean, safe and multicultural is a place where you understand that with a good city and national project even a tiny island can be an example to the world. In our visit to Singapore the J W Marriott was a wonderful complement, with the best executive lounge, great views to the city (we got a room in the 14th floor) great restaurants and bars, and a beautiful shopping area. In addition it has fantastic service of its concierge.",5,June 2018,
Great hotel with excellent service in a fantastic location,kiwimh,"This hotel was 5 star in every way. The staff were extremely friendly, courteous and went out of their way every time we made a request or needed assistance. The hotel is very well managed and it shows as every department was very customer oriented. We were very pleased with the executive lounge and the staff there went over and beyond. Especially Hazel went out of her way to make sure al of the guests were taken care of. The breakfasts were fantastic in the executive lounge with a chef cooking fresh eggs and omelettes to order. The hotel is located in South Beach and is very central to most attractions. We were able to walk most of the time, but they have a MRT stop right at the hotel too, so it makes it very easy to get around Singapore conveniently. We thoroughly enjoyed our…",5,June 2018,
Great Hotel - fab rooms and great location,Nicolafb,"I stayed here for just 2 nights and i will certainly be back.  The room was fantastic - very large, great view and extremely comfortable.  One word of warning there are a lot of mirrors but also lots of storage space and everything is very shiny and new which is nice.  The loo seat is a bit over the top (its's fully automatic!) but great shower and all was very quiet.  No noise from surrounding rooms.  I can't comment on the restaurants, pool or gym as I didn't use them.  However I saw the gym which looked extremely comprehensive and the infinity pool was a nice addition.  The location is good - the hotel is kind of in the MRT station so it's very well connected.  Otherwise it's only a 15 minute walk to the marina.  The only negative is the lobby - which is very small and…",5,June 2018,
Great JW Property,Jaume,"This is my 5th time in SIN and I used to stay at the Conrad or Ritz, until I discovered this relatively new addition to the JW family. Hotel architecture is impressive minimalistic contemporary and great location. Breakfast buffet at the restaurant and at the lounge are exceptional. Service is incomparable to any of the places I have been in Singapore. This is my new home away from home.",5,June 2018,
Very Impressed!,_lesley_benton,"Stayed at the JW Marriott in Singapore for 10 days and were very impressed with the level of service, location and amenities of this hotel. We had access to the executive lounge which exceeded all expectations and felt like an all inclusive resort with breakfast, afternoon tea, evening hors de hors d'oeuvres and cocktails included. We honestly did not need any other food or beverages during our stay and the quality of these and friendliness of the staff surpassed all expectations. I must give a mention to Hazel in the lounge, she went above and beyond to make our experience a memorable one. We would definitely stay here again when we next visit Singapore and highly recommend this hotel. It truly is a 5 star experience!!",5,July 2017,
Best new hotel in Singapore,SVRBlackBookAsia,Rooms are amazing bed comfortable and views stupendous. Dining choices immaculate and the spa here is top notch. Wether you are here for business or pleasure this is the hotel for you with its two stunning Swimming pools,5,October 2017,
Very central hotel.,FacebookGB,"We stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights and stayed in the East wing. You could not find a hotel in a better position.  Our rooms were quite nice but somewhat small. Breakfast was only available in the Executive  lounge and apparently we could only use the other breakfast room if we payed extra. This was a little disappointing as breakfast was ok but not fantastic. The highlight of our stay was visiting the Executive lounge were they serve afternoon tea at 2:30 and is very nice. The Executive Lounge also had great food between 5:30 and 7:30 pm and a great range of drinks from 5:30 and 9:30 PM. All at no extra cost. We spent many hours there meeting some other guests and chatting to the wonderful staff mainly Hazel, Lavinia and Kwang who really looked after us so well and could not…",4,June 2018,
Best JW in my opinion,Stephen B,"When you think of a 5 star hotel you expect exceptional service., but sometimes its just not there. This hotel exceed my expectations not only with the service but the extras you never even thought you'd needed.  I pulled up to the hotel in a cab the bellboy opened my car door almost before the cab even stopped.  Another bell boy grabbed my bags with out even having to ask. They lead me to the front desk again with out even asking. They just knew this is how 5 star service should  be. The bellboy also brought my bags to my room again didn't ask for it,but they know after along 17 hour flight you don't want to ask for anything you just want to relax. They guided me to my room. The elevator was amazing. I know funny to think an elevator would excite you,  but it does. There's…",5,June 2018,
Stay for our Anniversary,Steve M,"This was a trip to remember for me. Staff were amazing, friendly and always willing to chat. We met the manager while sitting in foyer and had no idea he was the manager. Very easy flowing conversation as he asked if we were ok which lead onto our trip for the day then into how we feel so comfortable with staff. At tbis point he advised that he is the manager and was extremely happy with our comments. Conversation went into what we do and where we were all from. Just loved it there and I can only say if going to Singapore stay here. I am looking forward to staying again.  Keep up the great work team.  Cheers  Steve and Angela",5,October 2017,
Luxury With Great Service,Peter H,"After a hectic four weeks in the UK & Ireland we opted for some extra days in Singapore to recharge on the way home.  We opted for the Executive Package which included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. While it was an additional cost, it was well worth it. The staff that ""manned"" the dining room area were extremely friendly and made you feel so welcome, especially Hazel - she is a great asset to this hotel as is Alvin from the bar & reception.  The beds were comfy, the shower & bathroom areas large and our room had views over towards the Marina.  A most enjoyable stay.",5,April 2018,
Great service and location,DaveandSue H,"The room & communal facilities were spotlessly clean and well maintained, as expected for a high end hotel. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff - you will be greeted by every staff member that you pass, and they are all very friendly and ready to help with any queries that you may have.  The executive lounge is a haven!  Bright, spacious, comfortable and well staffed, you can enjoy a peaceful breakfast, afternoon tea (fresh baked scones with jam & cream) as well as light fare in the evening. If you are lucky you will be greeted by Hazel, who will make you feel like you've found a new best friend.",5,June 2018,
Lovely hotel wonderful service,Melbourneartists,"We stayed for a week and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The customer service was outstanding. We had access to the excuative lounge which made our stay basically all inclusive. Buffet breakfast, afternoon tea, evening canapés and drinks. The position was very convenient. Only one thing bothered me...the reception area was long and narrow and became congested. I think with such a grand hotel they should have a big open foyer. The pool was on the 18th floor and we swam every day while looking out over the city",5,May 2018,
5-Stars is Underrated!,miloke,"Awesome awesome service by the entire team whilst looking after our event and participants!! Trully amazing!! Everything was like magic! The customer experience - flawless! And for the first time ever - coming from a person who has organised so many events, the hotel food for conferences and buffets are the best so far! Benchmark!!!",5,June 2018,
Does it get any better?,Jay M,We thought it would be tough to top our experience at JW Marriott in Phuket last week but the kind folks and amazing property at JW Singapore pulled it off. From the moment you check in to the moment you pull away for the last time the friendliest staff I’ve seen make sure that every detail is perfect. The property it’s self is new and shines like a diamond. The smiles on the faces of the staff shines every bit as bright. This hotel is perfectly located with the most fabulous views of the city. The design of the entire area is perfect. You can hop on the MRT (subway) directly below the hotel and there is a whole village of shops and restaurants underneath in the expansive mall. Prices are very similar to what we pay in the US and I have literally never seen a city of any size as…,5,June 2018,
Great hotel for business or tourism,Alexander S,"I stayed here on business but can see it being equally suitable to tourists. It's a very well located (near the main tourist sites and well located for the business district), relatively recently constructed, comfortable and quiet hotel. I was in a large, comfortable and spacious room on a relatively high floor (9) and can say the noise from outside was non-existent.  If you have executive lounge (with its excellent breakfast) access then you also get 2 free pieces of laundry a day (which is a perk I have never seen before and highly approve of). The staff are extremely nice.  Can't think of a criticism!",5,June 2018,
Loved it,Chris S,Only had a quick 1 night visit but loved it. Arrived early and room was ready. Used the SPG Mobile check in. Very convenient. The rooms are awesome and the bed super comfy. Had a swim in both pools then relaxed in the spa. Breakfast the next day was delicious. Alot of choices and I like the design. The ladies at Front Desk were very friendly. Location perfect. I will defiantly be back.,5,May 2018,
Almost a 5,Peter C,"The Marriott in Singapore is a 5-star hotel, brilliantly located, modern, and well fitted out in all respects as far as I could tell.  Its stand out is its staff - they deserve a rating of 6 out of 5!!  I have had the pleasure of experiencing many top-flight hotels and the Marriott staff are, if not the best, then certainly equal to any that I can recall.  So why only a 4 (almost a 5) rating.  Well, when I pay top $ to stay in a 5-star hotel I expect perfection, and they fell just a little short.  We'd chosen a package with executive lounge access, and the lounge, whilst acceptable, fell a little short of perfection.  The breakfast arrangements were a little disheveled - a lot crammed into a fairly small space which means that there are at times longer than expected waits.  And…",4,June 2018,

Central Location with Beautiful Views,Jane G,"Absolutely adored staying here with my mother to celebrate her birthday in June. Hazel and Jolie in the executive lounge were outstanding hostesses who went out of their way to make my mother feel special when they discovered we were in Singapore for her birthday. They even prepared a cake plate for her which we didn't realise, so unfortunately we missed out because we were sight seeing however the gesture was very much appreciated.   The facilities of the hotel were beautiful both in the lobby and in the room. Decor was sexy and modern, the linen was absolutely beautiful. A happy discovery was TWG tea provided in the mini bar. I'm a tea fanatic and after sampling the camomile every night in bed I had to stop in at a shop to purchase more to bring home! Dining options in the…",5,June 2018,
Funky Town,Janet A,"The staff at South Beach were all lovely. Each of them were welcoming with a warm smile and friendly hello - one cannot fault the staff.   The rooms are bright and clean, of course. The bathroom is spacious and modern. The lighting in the bathroom is a bit dim and could do with a proper make up light.   The ‘bedroom’ was a bit cramped with not much room to move around the king size bed. The mattress was very comfortable and the pillows were like big clouds that my head sunk in to.   The gym was cool!  Cool as in air conditioned to a temperature that kept me cool when doing a 1/2 hour run.   The 4 of us booked executive rooms so that we had access to the Executive Lounge for breakfast and drinks in the evening. Breakfast was okay - the good points; not too crowded that we…",4,June 2018,
Normal staycation. Can be improved.,Wong S,"The room 433  that I stayed in was a premier room. The bathroom had an issue where the water drainage through the pipes created a loud noise after using the bathroom. They need to fix it as this is a pumbling issue.  Secondly, the way the reception desk is located at the ground floor is pretty confusing and architecturally not designed well in my opinion.During busy period for checkin or checkout, you do not know which queue to follow and there is potentially confusion. Although there is a guest relations person to facilitate the process, it is still not ideal due to the layout design.   Thirdly, I had to call in 3 times at the front desk on the first day to request for additional toiletries.  As I did not use the F&B outlet at JW mariott, my review does not include this.

Modern,Calliopehk,This is one of the newer hotels and we stayed one night en-route. The staff is very friendly and efficient- but someone needs to sort out the ergonomics of the desk computers! Staff struggling with the height. Lift and lobby art and lighting interesting. Rooms nice but the fancy Japanese toilets make a lot of noise and light that’s not good if you don’t want to wake up your companion at night. Shower door handle came off when opening door... Beds comfortable.,4,June 2018,
Nice hotel and well located,Rabin M,Enjoyed the stay and the hotel is very well located   5 mins walk from suntec exhibition hall and lots of eatery  The room was great and had a nice view of the padang  While the staff are extremely helpful some of the front desk staff are relatively new and not fully familiar with all aspects   But on the whole they ensured that the correct info is conveyed within a short period   I enjoyed the stay,5,May 2018,
Super Singapore Selection ! Marriott Marvelous!,FinnyElTraveler,"JW Marriotts are my favorite Marriott hotels. I have been to many of them across the world and across the country.

Great Marriott,Mike W Jones,"I am a loyal Marriott which means that I never get excited about one of their properties.  However, the JW in Singapore is above and beyond.

This is a great place to base yourself while visiting Singapore.",5,June 2018,

Great stay,David B,"Just spent three nights at the JW Marriott & can highly recommend it. Our stay was in a club room giving us lounge access. I cannot praise the lounge staff highly enough in fact all the staff throughout the hotel were excellent. Friendly, efficient an absolute credit to the hotel. The only issue & it’s minor is the breakfast service in the lounge. A bigger egg station is required as queuing for eggs or omelettes became quite long & at times frustrating.  The hotel has an excellent location, is very modern, has great facilities, an awesome pool area with gym. The big stand out though is the staff.",5,June 2018,
Excellent Stay,flik4888,"My friends had an excellent stay in JW Marriott thanks to the Exec Lounge team, especially Miss Ann Margareth. I was always very well taken care of and I am glad that her team and herself extended the JW Marriott hospitality spirit not only to my guests but to the guests of my guests as well.

Overwhelmed and Underwhelming,jeffreyb619,"Staffs are generally overwhelmed. Some are well trained while others try their best from the reception area, executive lounge to main breakfast hall. In general all staffs tried their best to provide the best service but could not keep up to the demand at JW Marriott standard. I would like to highlight a main hall restaurant Chef (chicken rice section) put up a grumpy face when serving and waiter needs to “beg” for his help. I bet this attitude of the middle managers doesn’t not help the frontline staff to due customer requests and add more stress to them, hence an overall underwhelming experience.  Good room setup and nice bath room. Executive lounge a bit “cold” as lots of metallic chairs and tables are used. Does not feel as inviting and comfy as Marriott Tangs.",3,June 2018,
Perfect.,Leila D,I have been curious to stay at this designer's hotel. Young and fun design with art everywhere. Modern room & facilities. Comfortable beddings. Love the club lounge. They say it is the largest in Singapore and I believe that. So spacious. Highly recommended to book room at club floors. Gym opens 24 hours. The pool is rather small but acceptable. Love also the open air bar on top floor (next to the gym). The hotel is located at South Beach Rd. Easy to move around.,5,June 2018,
Staycation,Chong A,We had an unusually Long 5 nights staycation in this rather narcissistic hotel. The beautiful panel at the entrance gave us a welcoming feel. Check in was efficient and we were upgraded to the TOP floor facing Marina Sand. The room is rather tight so I guessed it was dressed with mirrors everywhere. So much so there is only one hook in the whole toilet. It was really irritating when I need to use the bathroom and WC as no hook was available to hang clothing. Even the pool at the six level was lined with mirrors!  Again no hook in the changing rooms! Service was warm and unpretentious. I couldn’t figure out why they send us a birthday cake which I turned away thinking the server made a mistake. But thanks anyway because my granddaughter enjoyed it.  Gold elite members are well…,4,June 2018,

Wonderful visit to the JW,lrd897,"We really enjoyed this hotel. Nice modern decor with a lot of gadgets in the room (everything automated, even the toilet which was endlessly entertaining for my son). Fantastic lounge with great food. Great views from the rooms.  Pools were amazing. Lower pool had little private seating areas that were great for relaxing. Upper pool had fantastic views of the harbor plus a bar, ping pong tables, etc. Really great place to hang out. The only downside was the temperature of the pool. Sounds crazy because it is hot in Singapore but the pool was FREEZING. I got in just to enjoy the view and was SO COLD. If they would just heat it even slightly to take the chill off, it would be so much more pleasant but I barely got in because it was just unpleasantly cold. Such a disappointment…",5,September 2017,

Bag were in our rooms in no time at all. Hotel is in a great location just across from sun city shopping centre. Part of our package was access to Executive Lounge. Afternoon Tea,Evening Snacks and open bar for 4 hours. The Rooms were just amazing. Comfortable bed. Amazing shower room. It’s what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. We explored the whole hotel. It was just wonderful. Could not fault it in any way.  So if your looking to spoil yourself next time your in Singapore. Try the JW Marriott.  ",5,June 2018,

I stayed during the time Mr Trump was here for the summit so the hotel and surrounding buildings were awash with film crews and international press, yet not once did that detract from the calm and peace of the hotel.  I must emphasise the quality of the executive lounge which was fantastic, the range of food options from breakfast through afternoon team and then into the evening was of the highest quality and was only surpassed by the attentive service of Hazel and her colleagues who made me so welcome and ensured I had a fantastic time.…",5,June 2018,
Excellent stay,Rubbers2,I spent 3 nights with 3 girlfriends and we had a blast.  Our desk included Executive Club access which was fantastic.  Hazel in particular looked after us so well. The inclusions meant it was a great value deal. Check-in was more chaotic than it needed to be.,4,June 2018,
Not up to usual JW Marriott Standards,XUSA_TravelerX,"I had a mixed experience at this hotel.  I checked in very late at night and there was nobody available to help with luggage.   The person checking in realized it was tricky for me to handle it myself and he at least helped me to the elevator but after that, I was on my own.  Not a great way to start a stay at what I thought was a full-service hotel.  I unpacked and decided I wanted some room service, however, I found out that this hotel does not offer 24 hour room service and closes at 2am.  It was 1:59am when I realized this so I was out of luck.  Very unusual for a JW Marriott.  I checked the minibar hoping to have a glass of wine after a long flight but there was no wine in the minibar.  My room was ok but there were very few surfaces on which to put my things. I did not…",3,April 2018,
Luxury y modern,Romaine in Spain,Our aircrew stayed here and the hotel is located next to the largest water fountain as well as its largest shopping mall.  The stay was comfortable and the food was awesome. This is a must visit if you are wanting relaxation and comfort.,5,July 2017,
"Outstanding service from hotel staff, great location",Ken B,"Marriott Rewards Gold Elite member (pre-Aug 2018 status) and wife arriving from Marina Bay Cruise Terminal at 9:30am. The hotel staff immediately welcomed us and we were given an absolutely outstanding (upgraded) room on an Executive Floor that overlooked the Singapore Cricket pitch and WW II Civilian War Memorial.  The Executive Lounge was the best I've experienced with excellent food, drink, service and an attentive staff.  The lounge staff, particularly Jolie, Lavinda and Hazel provided first rate service and were very friendly.  The Concierge desk was also very helpful.  They were able to provide a voltage converter so my wife's 115 VAC curling iron could be used.  It arrived in our room just a few minutes after we stopped at the desk with our request.  As mentioned by other…",5,May 2018,
Here for 7 wonderful days. The hotel was centrally located.,jdabbondio,The room was excellent with city views. The staff were very helpful. The breakfast was excellent and staff very friendly.  Vargilia and Hazel were particularly friendly . Fully recommend breakfast and the hotel,5,June 2018,
Beautiful hotel,Lauri J,"This hotel has everything...beautiful rooms, great food, and exceptional service. To make it better, it is within walking distance of shopping and the inner harbor. Staying here made the trip even better!",5,September 2017,
A must location when in SIN,HK1966LB,"I been in this property end of May 2018 for a two days business trip: location is simply perfect - well connected with subway and in a very good place if you want to walk around to MBS and quite close to airport. Room design is really lovely and is a good mix of modern with the business meeting part that is an colonial building just in front of Raffles hotel. A mention should go to the services provided and in particularly to the executive lounge... it's simply fantastic, one of the best exec lounge I ever been around the world... either for the stylish, the services, the quality and variety of food!  This is now becoming my location every time I will pass from Singapore.",5,May 2018,
Excellent Stay At A Fine Property,KU_Explorer,"As usual for my reviews, any negative remarks are in square brackets. We arrived at the hotel, located in South Beach, Singapore at around midday and were pleased to be allowed to check in early (we had requested this prior to our arrival). The check in experience was quick, and the staff were very friendly - we were offered complimentary fruit juice on arrival which was a simple, yet nice touch. We did have to pay a deposit/hold of 600 $SGD for incidentals which was unexpected although perhaps it did state it somewhere in the small print. The hotel lobby is large, bright and welcoming and very modern (it opened for business less than 2 years ago). There are 20 floors serviced by 6 lifts which, throughout our stay, were always quick to arrive and quick to travel up/down the…",4,June 2018,
They could have done it better,Izhar CJ,"Right so me and my sister had this Star Wars Run we’re going and we thought of staying in a 5 Star Hotel after all the run would paid off.  We need to recheck about it cause of few problems we’ve encountered.  First of all, along the South Beach area, there are many Hotels that could’ve been our pick but JW Marriott wins it cause of its design and so I thought the pool was an infinity pool, heard lots of good perks regarding Marriott services etc. Heck why not to try it out for our first Marriott experience.  The Hotel location wise to the MRT is practically the best as it located on top of Esplanade station. Yes you read it right! Below the Hotel is a MRT station.  Ok once we’re at the Concierge / Reception area, we were greeted by I believe her name is Sher Mei? Char May?…",2,May 2018,
Well Mixed Place,Farano Gunawan,"We made reservation through booking.com for four rooms two nights, a big family trip (Woro, Wikan, Tara, Victoria) Front desk staff (Ms.Angel) helps a lot during the peak hours. Lovely restaurant; a south east Asia concept with fresh herbs on buffet.  Great recreational spots at 18th floor, plenty of fun were arouse. Lies on Esplanade MRT station, caused easy to catch whole island. During checking out, Tatsuko Matsuba(?) Assist us patiently along with friendly staffs. ",5,June 2018,
"Amazing stay, a must!",Catherine P,"Bravo to the JW Marriott! Made the stay so pleasant and comfortable. The rooms were ultra modern and pristine. All needs were tended to. Everyone was genuinely kind and helpful. Big shot out to those at the Executive Lounge, Hazel’s contagious smile, Chef Chee Y for accommodating my son’s Laksa soup, Ann Margareth’s amazing welcoming, Jaqueline’s awesome recommendation to the Marina Bay Sands and her connections there... sweet Mazira! Can’t say enough about this team. Definitely coming back!",5,June 2018,
The Extras that make for a most wonderful stay,81bps,"We stayed two nights at JW in May 2018.  Besides the great room (comfortable bed, great bathtub and good range of TV channels), the little extras put in by the hotel and their staff made the stay really enjoyable and the occasion we were celebrating more memorable.   First, the hotel arranged a delicious cake for us.  Then at the Club lounge, Lavinda enthusiastically introduced to the snake fruit and made sure we were comfortable and enjoying the items presented during tea and cocktail hours.  Then Jun Kiat and Chee Hean made our 2nd night at the club lounge really special.  My wife was craving for something soupy in the evening and they offered to make a bowl of kway teow soup for her.  It was really kind of them. The hotel even provided a small dryer in the toilet near the…",5,May 2018,

Comfort in singapore,chgogid,"Stayed here for 5 nights this week 05/30 - 06/02 and enjoyed the stay immensely. Had a wonderful it suite in the 12th floor with wonderful views from bedroom, bathroom and living rooms. Service at the executive lounge was excellent, Hazel, Jolie and Rio were welcoming in making our visits to the lounge feel like home! Front office was always polite and constantly greeting you. 2 pools were great and 24 hr gym well equipped and never overcrowded. Only area for room of improvement Is the restaurant. Breakfast was the most uneventful. Staff seemed unmotivated and unfriendly. Had to constantly ask for coffee, tea spoons for coffee, only place I have dined in that don't serve tea spoons with coffee, had to ask for tea spoons every morning. Restaurant set up and feel was excellent,…",5,June 2018,

Singapore Spectacular hotel stay,CHRISWPERTH,"What a great place to stay in Singapore. From the moment we stepped out of the Taxi and were greeted by the staff we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. Great position in the Marina Bay area with the Esplanade Train Station below, it is convenient to get to any location by public transport which is extremely easy and cheap.  Room was very comfortable and always spotless and breakfast was excellent. Staff in the Executive lounge were very attentive especially ""Hazel"" who greeted us with a smile every day. The food by chefs Shah and Song was great.  Will definitely stay here next holiday visit to Singapore and will recommend it to friends",5,May 2018,
Probably the best hotel I’ve ever visited,jim_math_1,"This was a wonderful visit.  The swimming pool and the executive lounge are both superb facilities.

Amazing,Alexander B,Stunning hotel just to the north of Marina Bay. Beautifully decorated interior. The bar on level 18 has some of the nicest views over Singapore. We were particularly thankful for the excellent friendly service with a smile in the executive lounge from Hazel and Virginia!,5,May 2018,
Loved our stay,RemaB22,We stayed at the jw Marriott for a weekend away and were blown away with the wonderful and friendly service. The rooms were clean and have great amenities. Our favourite time was having our morning coffee enjoying the view from our window lounge. The hotel is in a fabulous location and many Singapore attractions are easily accessible. Lots of places to eat nearby  within the hotel and the food is sensational. We really enjoyed our stay thank you.,5,May 2018,
My favourite hotel in Singapore,anitawu1,"Every time I come back to this hotel, also discovered their improvements including their service, environment, etc. and gives me a feel that I'm back to my home.  The location is very convenience, there is MRT, walking distance to Suntec. Really good for shopping.  Also, don't miss our the swimming pool at Flow 18, the view is excellent!  ",5,June 2018,
Staycation,michiekun,Definitely the most awesome place to relax and chill with exceptional service from Hazel and Mark from the hotel lounge. Will come back for sure and recommend friends to experience the warm welcome and great service,5,May 2018,
Hospitable and great experience!,MC M,"It was our first time to visit Singapore and have chosen to stay here at JW MARRIOTT BEACH coz of the highly recommendations from the reviewers, and it is so true! The minute we walked in the executive lounge, we already received a warm welcome and such hospitable staff. A special shoutout to HAZEL, Chef Shah and Chef Jun for such an amazing service and food. We have stayed in many other SPG group hotels, thus far MARRIOTT hotels are the best! We will be going back here again and hopefully we will stay in one of the hotels in Waikiki in next visit towards end of August.",5,May 2018,
Best hotel in Singapore,Sithsopha N,"I really love this hotel. Everything here is so good. I came here 2 times until now. Room, service, restaurants and the stuff are so nice. I hope I can come back again and again. If you want to come to Singapore don't forget this hotel is best here.",5,May 2018,
Good Service,KeisterKei,"As a platinum member who has been here for the 5th time, I am impressed with the quality of service provided by the hotel, especially Hazel and Melvin. We visit the lounge often and we encounter these friendly people who try their best to help us, which really makes the hotel experience much better. Once I got a sore throat, and Melvin went out of his way to find a fresh squeezed lemon juice with honey, which saved my life in time for an important business meeting. Hazel is very kind and made sure all our personal needs were met. We are very touched by these people. When we wanted directions to certain places, the front desk was most certainly helpful, and the surroundings of the hotel is convenient. We will definitely continue to come here. ",5,May 2018,
Perfectly Located Hotel,Odette A,"Stay here for work conference in May, Great Location with MRT walking distance, lovely rooms  and staff were extremely helpful. Roof top bar and pool area with lovely views over Marina Bay.  Would definitely stay here again ",5,May 2018,
Imperfection among the perfection,Sh3ryLL,"Friend booked a suite room last week and I was pretty excited about it which I don't know why maybe its because of SPG or rather its because of the sophisticated furnishes with Phillip Stark?   Upon entering the room, I find that the layout of the room its bit odd. A writing desk behind the living room sofa couch but ok its the building structure and we r unlucky to get this room.    I have no complains about the bed, bedroom and bathroom that has 2 washing sinks so couples need not fuss over waiting for it, who uses it 1st etc.    But what truly shocked me was the fruit amentity placed in a Suite Room!

Excellent Service / Excellent Location / Close to shopping / Does not include Bfast,EltonMa,"- Service / Staff are very good and professional - Location is best.  Right next to Suntec City / Train stations.  Don't worry about raining too, it's all covered - The hotel does not generally include breakfast, so you need to buy it separately. - The room is good, but I just don't like the deco, it's just personal taste.  The painting, mirrors etc...   There is a human shape shade (part of the deco) on the wall, when I turn off the light, it's a bit ... you know.",4,May 2018,
A rejuvenating staycation gone wrong,Jas,"It was not our first time staying at JW Marriott South Beach and we really like the restaurants, ambience at South Beach, convenient location (Esplanade MRT station) and proximity to Marina Bay Sands and Suntec City Mall.   So we decided to go for a short staycation to relax after a busy work week. Chanced upon JW Marriott South Beach’s hotel package with spa (massage) for 2.   It turned out to be my worst spa experience. While the facilities are new, the steam room smelt mouldy and the almonds at the relaxation lounge was crawling with full of ants. The part that took the cake was the massage. Being a fan of massages/spa treatments, maybe I expected too much of Marriott. The massage was so bad that we are never ever going back for any massage/spa treatments!   While the room…",2,May 2018,
one of the best hotels we have stayed in.,aussietraveller57,"Booked this hotel through Luxury escapes for a 3 night stay. What a wonderful luxury hotel, I believe its about 1 year that its been opened. Ideally located walking distance to gardens and Wheel. Metro station downstairs....what an excellent way to get around.  We booked a kingbed room with Executive Club facilities. Pay the extra for this luxury....well worth it. Free wine, beer and spirits from 5.30 to 9.30. all you can drink...as those who have been in Singapore before, alcohol is very expensive. In addition they serve ""snacks"" between 5.30 and 7.30....its almost like a mini buffet feed...amazing to the point that we had one meal over 3 days , outside the hotel.  There is a lovely swimming pool, etc. ....turn down nightly service and beautiful rooms. Breakfast also included,…",5,May 2018,
Great hotel with very helpful and friendly staff,Steve N,"Nice spacious rooms, good views, 2 pools, great executive lounge with a range of snacks in the evening and afternoon tea in the afternoon.

Very quick laundry service.  Easy access to shops and trains.",5,April 2018,
Great Hotel for Business in Singapore,drzastaw,"Amazing hotel in the heart of everything.  Great views from the open-air pool deck on the 18th floor, especially at night.

The hotel was very new and modern, and the staff went out of their way to ensure we were satisfied. Special shout out to Hazel in the executive lounge for going above and beyond, always inviting us every day for breakfast, tea, and appetizers. She was very warm and accommodating, and definitely embodied the service I’ve come to love from Marriott properties.  Location was convenient and close to Marina Bay and a whole bunch of sights. Infinity pool on the top floor is beautiful (good views) and the fitness center is well equipped. Would definitely stay again.",5,May 2018,
Great Location,redrocks07,"We stayed at the JW Marriott South Beach for 3 nights prior to a cruise. It was a great location for touring the sites of Singapore, being able to walk to most everything including Gardens by the Bay and Chinatown. It was also close to the Esplanade Metro station which we used a few times. We were able to use the executive lounge and it was very good for both breakfast and happy hour.",5,April 2018,
Great hotel and very conveniently located,SiddharthDhamija,"The area around Suntec convention in Singapore is overcrowded when it comes to choices between 5 star hotels but, JW Marriot stands out amongst others. As in the case of any other JW Marriot property, everything is “best in class” and hence I cannot go into describing individual elements like room size, WIFI, Room service, breakfast spread, restaurant options etc. What stood out for me is the “Tonic” Bar at this hotel. I have never seen any other bar with such extensive stocking of Gins; Just loved it.",5,May 2018,
A Bright Gem,Barbara W,"Situated close to the Conference Centre with easy access to the MRT staying at The JW Marriott provided the effortless best of all worlds. The breakfast buffet is so extensive that despite a 7 day stay we did not manage to get through all choices. The classy Madame Fan dining room situated within the NGO Club is attached to the hotel and a wide range of mall eating is easily accessible.The staff are attentive and friendly, the welcome is warm and nothing is too much trouble. Sound proofing within the rooms is excellent providing for a great nights' sleep in a very comfy bed within a well appointed room. The 18th floor pool, gym and bar/food facilities with wide  360 degree views across Singapore are so enjoyable.L lovely hotel, a wonderful stay - we will be back",5,May 2018,

I told Hazel, that I would give her a shout out for her outstanding care and service in the lounge..thank you.",5,May 2018,
Not quite a business hotel and need lots of improvement,A.Chew,"I decided to try the new JW Marriott after seeing some raving reviews. I booked it for 4 nights and I had to check out after just one night!  Moved back to my trusted Conrad Hotel for the balance of 3 nights. Here's my feedback  Pros : 1. Location is near to MRT 2. Breakfast - very good selection 3. Nice view of the city  Cons : and it is pretty bad  1. They provided a cheap metal rocking chair - which is ridiculous to seat on if you are trying to get some work done. Had to put a towel to sit on as it doesn't have cushion 2. The automatic toilet - Cool technology, but the whole night, it was ""calibrating"" and kept waking me up every 1-2 hours 3. The bed - I was expecting at least super single bed, but it went cheap on a single bed 4. The air - dust is still settling and still…",2,May 2018,

Recently renovated property in fantastic condition,thoran13,"This hotel was recently renovated so everything is in top-notch condition. The rooms are new, sheets/blankets felt fresh and new. The pool had a decent view though was a bit small personally for my tastes.  Location was a little out of the way relative to other hotels clustered around the marina, however the fact that it was inside of a complex which included a lot of restaurants and shops made up for it.  My only nit-pick would be that room service was incredibly inconsistent. One day I came back at 4pm and my room had still not been cleaned. Additionally I greatly enjoyed the truffle potato chips in the mini-bar but this was not replaced after first consumption (while other items in the mini-bar were).",4,May 2018,

The place to stay in Singapore,Quills G,"This hotel is located in the heart of the Marina. The subway, the Suntech convention centre, national gallery and sightseeing tours are nearby. The food at the hotel is excellent and very healthy. The hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful. They gave me suggestions for restaurants and things to see nearby. The highlight of my trip was the SPA. It was a phenomenal experience. They have so many services that really help you relax. The hotel is made of 3 buildings and has to two infinity pools, one in the shade and one is the sun. There are services for Children as well and a candy bar when you come into the hotel. Very exciting. If I had to stay here again, I definitely would. Absolutely loved and highly recommend it.",5,May 2018,
Sub-par and disappointing service standards,Etravelbug,"I booked a room at the JW Marriott South Beach for my wedding proposal. Would have expected more, but their service was NOT up to standards.  The entire experience from the time I booked the hotel till the stay and departing was mediocre. Being a frequent traveler to most of the 5 star branded hotels in Asia (not trying to brag here), I really expected way more than the sub-standard service I received.  After booking the hotel, I gave the front desk a call to inform them that I was planning to have my wedding propose at my stay with them. Immediately, I was referred to the concierge who then referred to the VIP concierge service.

We stayed there over the Mothers Day weekend and I made the mistake of thinking the hotel breakfast would be a great Mothers Day treat.  It wasn't.  The food was average, it was very expensive, and the service was ordinary.  I would come again to stay, but would not use the restaurant.",3,May 2018,
Great Hotel,Chris B,We only had a 3 day visit but that was long enough to know we'll be back. From check in to check out just wonderful staff.

Hazel made everyone feel special. We cannot recommend the JW Marriot more highly and are already planning our next visit...thank you.,5,May 2018,
Superb hotel.  Wonderful experience.,Lizconsultant,"I stayed at the hotel recently whilst on business in Singapore.  It was the first time I had stayed at the hotel since I usually stay on Orchard Road.  JW Marriott was an amazing experience even before my arrival since they had organised taxis for me to and from my client site for each day of my stay.  On arrival the reception team were warm, welcoming and really helpful.  The reception was fully staffed which is not the case at many of the hotels I stay at.   The impressive modern décor of the lobby area was replicated in my bedroom and the room was bright and spacious.  The bathroom was amongst the best I have ever seen - and I travel a lot on business.  There are lots of options for dining within the hotel and in the immediate vicinity.  I dined in the main restaurant and…",5,May 2018,

Although curtains drawn, sweets placed on bed and towels cleared, no slippers by bedside or water bottles (apparently brand standard doesn’t require or reason given was small side tables) trash bins weren’t cleared, ice bucket not filled, used tea cups not cleared, water bottles not replenished. DM was informed (ard 10 pm) and she informed HK right away. But when we returned at 1230 am, only slippers were done!

5 nights of luxury,Leejune777,"We really enjoyed the JW Marriott hotel in Singapore.  We were booked in for 5 nights into a ""larger"" room which seemed a bit small on arrival and had access to the Club Lounge for drinks and meals/snacks.  Overall it was a great experience and would stay there again.  Our room on Level 12 was comfortable except the pillows were too soft but the hotel did change for us and then it was fine.  The Club Lounge was fantastic.  Great selection of wines, beers and mixed drinks and very nice breakfast and all day snacking.  Everyday there was something different so it was enjoyable and not the same food everyday.

Excellent !,ikes79,"Well its JW Marriott!! 😀 Excellent service would be expected as you walk in to the hotel right? All staff friendly and informative, from the reception desk to the restaurant. The room is beautiful and very comfy, the restaurant provides great range of food. Its very lovely and we would love to go back again on our next visit. The hotel has 2 swimming pool, At 6th fl and 18th fl, this one has a stunning view.  The location is good super close to South Beach/Esplanade MRT Station, and close to Marina Square, and Suntec City Mall",5,May 2018,

We found the confirmation email, which confirmed out stay. As a result, we were upgraded.  The rooms are quite small, however, lovely amenities. The infinity pool was fabulous, with unbelievable views over the city.  Could even sit at a table/chairs in the pool (ankle depth) and look out at the city. It was lovely. The Executive Lounge was good, with both western and Asian cuisine.  When they say cocktails are offered in the Exec Lounge, it means you have to make them yourself, there is no one serving cocktails.  All in all, a great stay, across the road from Suntec Mall and trains, walking distance to Gardens by the Bay and Fullerton Hotel for high tea.  I would stay there again and…",5,May 2018,

Saathiis Mohan is the Boss!,John J,"Having stayed 10 times over the last year, I can say that the team at JW Marriott make you feel at home.  The service is exceptional, the people friendly and the hotel oozes style.  The rooms aren't huge but give you everything that I need.  Could not consider going anywhere else.

Feels pretty average,jbm4075,"I always recommend anyone visiting Singapore to find a hotel around City Hall MRT, given the central location and convenience afforded by public transportation options. Having stayed at more than half a dozen hotels around here over the years, I really wanted to try this recently rebranded JW Marriott Hotel @ South Beach.   Unfortunately the only thing I liked about this hotel was its location (part of the South Beach complex, connected to Esplanade MRT and a short underground walks to Raffles City and Suntec City). The hotel itself was rather mediocre and not befitting the positioning and premium pricing of the JW Marriott brand. I reckon the Average Room Rate should be dropped by $100 and this should be a regular Marriott hotel instead.   The rooms are spacious but white…",4,May 2018,
Amazing Hotel -,Kym B,"We arrived at this hotel on the 9th April and stayed for three nights before flying home to Tasmania. This hotel would have to be the best we have ever stayed in and hope that we can return some time. The rooms were beautiful and clean, the staff were just amazing, we were treated like royalty, especially Stella in reception and Hazel in the Executive Lounge, in fact, all the staff were absolutely brilliant. Well done to JW Marriott for having the best 'customer service' staff I have ever encountered.  ",5,April 2018,
Hang our at the pool!,shuyi m,"The rooms are smallish and the overall hotel layout is kind of zig-saggy....always seems to be finding our way, especially at breakfast.

Still give5stars though there’s some flaws,Pawarisa Lainey K,"I really love the design and surrounding area. So easy to commute as the mrt station is just within the hotel area. Mrt passage linked to so many malls nearby. Suntec city with hundreds of shops is just opposite the hotel with undercover footbridge and linked to hotel area again.

Toilet is so modern with automatic toilet bowl.   Japanese restaurant atB1 is marvelous. Staff is super super nice and friendly. And oh my god the food is amazing especially the beef.

Chairman Suite,alvin410,"I was upgraded from Premium Suite to Chairman Suite. The entire suite was very well decorated and extremely comfortable. The view from the 21st floor was mesmerizing. The hotel's location is superb, there are many good restaurants on the 1st floor and shopping malls are located just across the road. It is just a 2 minutes walk to the nearest MRT station. All the hotel staff are very polite and helpful. As I was planning a proposal, I greatly appreciated the hotel staff who brought me around and showed me the suites even before I made my booking. It was a wonderful and unforgettable stay. I will definitely be back for this luxurious experience again.",5,April 2018,
A Wonderful First Experience in Singapore,Ashley O,"I was in Singapore for a business trip and stayed at the J.W. for 7 nights. I had an excellent experience and really enjoyed my stay. The only slightly negative comment that I have is that the pool area wasn’t really my favorite. I went up in the evening, an hour before it was about to close, and there was a cocktail party happening and the pool was completely lit up and very shallow and people were sitting around in suits, so I wasn’t thrilled about stripping down to my swimsuit and swimming in a brightly lit pool. But with that being said, the view from the pool area was gorgeous at night and you could look out across Merlion Park.   Some of the highlights that I really enjoyed: They always had two large candy bowls in the entry way for a quick snack and left chocolates on…",5,April 2018,
A nice hotel with some unconventional design elements.,Ince13,"One of Marriott’s newest acquisitions in Singapore. The newness of the hotel is still very noticeable. The largely ‘metallic’ furnishing used, however is easily scratched and provides both a cold feel and look.  I always enjoy the additional perks of the executive floor. Different about this hotel is that it does not have an outright executive floor area, which in my opinion somewhat reduces the exclusivity. On busy days and sometimes not so busy days, the rush for and lack of food during breakfast, tea and hors d’ouvre time is very obvious. It is not uncommon to run out of food which takes a long time to replenish. Breakfast is functional, with a mini selection of what is on offer at the Beach Road Kitchen.  During my last stay, end of April 18, the bar even managed to run out…",4,April 2018,

Modern hotel conveniently located,BunburyTim61,"Stayed 3 nights whilst attending conference at Suntec Convention Centre. Hotel was located opposite the Convention Centre and was connected through a covered walkway in another ""tower"" a very short walk away. Checking in was quick and efficient and room was tastefully decorated in modern style.  Room was small and narrow which may explain why there are so many mirrors in the room. Narrow as in the foot of bed and back of seat to desk was almost touching. This made it difficult to walk past without having to move the chair. Also TV was mounted above the desk so you either work using the desk or watch TV but difficult to do both. On the other hand the bathroom was generously appointed and spacious with a separate Japanese Toto toilet. Bottled water was complimentary and…",5,April 2018,

Staff member Hazel was a lovely polite person who assisted you constantly and was friendly. She excelled with her assistance and knowledge of Singapore.

Excellent hotel for business or pleasure!,Joe M,Had a short stay in May and was wowed. The hotel is very new and so benefits from all sorts of modern touches. I was upgraded to a suite on the 13th floor (pictured); the room was amazing. The gym (pictured) is on the 18th floor with what is essentially a rooftop pool and activity room for kids.   The hotel itself is located in a new development right across the street from the historic Raffles Hotel (which is undergoing restoration). There are plenty of nice shops and restaurants nearby; the Orchard Road high street area is about a 10-15 minute taxi ride away.  Lounge is nice and large and the breakfast served there is of good quality. All staff is friendly and willing to help. I would not hesitate to book a room here during my next visit to Singapore.,5,May 2018,

Good but not Great...,LouisSshen,"Having heard the great stuff about the JW, my partner and i have decided to book the weekend for his birthday celebration. We stayed in Room 555 on the 28th April.   Let's start with what we love:  1. The room was lovely, housekeeping did a great job considering how hard it is to maintain a room like this.  2. Most of the people that we met were friendly, mainly the HSKP, F&B and Spa team.  3. Check in was a breeze but there was a queue at check out, hence we opted for the express check out.  4.

Having flown into Changi, we had to get a Skytrain to Terminal 2 to get to the MRT station. The train took us to City Hall. We had to change trains at the Tanah Merah Interchange. Getting from the station to the hotel was a bit of a puzzle but we made it eventually.  We were checked into a fabulous suite - room 1414 - with living room, kitchen, two toilets, bathroom with huge bath and shower. It has great views of the city too.

As compare to other marriott hotel, service was not what I expect. Hotel seems new but some of the things have already worn off or stained.

So, why am I not too negative on the price, well, it has to do with having access to the executive lounge, which shaved at least $150 a day in food, if you would chose to eat there.

This was a hotel that boast of Philippe Starck's designs, and I have been looking forward to having a staycation there.    Check-in was a breeze, and the ride up the lift was exciting, with the underwater concept and the changing colours of the lights.  I was assigned a corner room, and I found the bathroom to be as big as the main part of the room, if not bigger.  The 2 single beds were really single beds, which was disappointing.  For such a prestigious hotel, I would have expected at least a super single bed.  But the mattresses were firm and comfortable, just be careful not to roll off.

The extra cost of a room with lounge access is more than compensated in that if you had to dine out with drinks etc in Singapore it can easily set you back more than the extra for the lounge.   Our check-in at about 2pm was most courteous although our room was not quite ready. They simply popped us in the Lounge for a magnificent afternoon tea.

The rooms are very sleek and minimalist - my corner room was great though the hallway to enter seemed a bit of wasted space (see pics).  The dinner buffet was gargantuan (but the price matches the offerings) and the chef kindly even cooked me grilled lamb chops on request even though they were not readily apparent at the grill station .

The basics of the hotel were not quite so good, a little dirty on the walls behind check-in, reasonable but a little basic in the executive lounge - but still quirky. Well situated, just in front of the old Raffles, but I wouldn't rush back",4,April 2018,

We booked a day before so that we don't have to wait for a few hours just to get in. For some reason me and my mum's room got upgraded to premium! I decided to unpack and do some random stuff. In the afternoon, we found out there was a pool on level 18. So I got my hotel card, got up the elevator and into the cold pool. It was really cold until you got the hang of it. Then the next few days, I ate food at the buffet for lunch. Delicious food! It is the 5th day of my 7 days of Singapore, planning to go to Universal Studios.

The accommodation was a little cramped in our deluxe room because the rocking chair was too large for the available space between the desk and the end of the bed.  The bed was very comfortable and the pillow menu satisfied my needs.  The hotel is ideally located for the Esplanade MRT station and…",4,April 2018,
my family had a lovely stay!,laptopndiapers,"Our family enjoyed our 4-day stay at this hotel. The architecture and interiors are superb! all the staff were friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and the bed is comfy. My husband and son loves taking a dip in the bathtub. The only problem was the stainless chair since the edge of the bottom part is a bit stuck out, we kept tripping on it since it blends well in the carpet. We love the breakfast so much and the one handling the omelette and pancake station deserves a pat in the back. More so, Sherly and Julia were very attentive and friendly that my son really enjoyed his breakfast. The swimming pools were very nice. The one on the 18th floor is a bit small but has a great view of the city. Be aware though that the water is cold. We also tried the one on the 6th floor…",5,April 2018,

A visual experience and a mixed bag of highs and lows,NFitzdelfini,"We had mixed feelings about this hotel on our 15th visit to Singapore. Overall we were pleased we tried it out and it’s visually an interesting experience to take in however in other ways it didn’t quite get there for us. So apart from the visual experience we found the staff very friendly and accommodating, the beach road kitchen provided a fantastic breakfast again with excellent service, and the gym was well equipped. The location is good with dining and bar options below the hotel and with access to the MTR and underground walkways that can easily get you to the Marina Bay Area. We also liked the size of the Premier room with separate sitting area, the bathroom was great, however the bed we found hard, and the sitting area looked good but the furniture was not comfortable at…",3,April 2018,
Singapore Trip - Feb 2018_Bhandal,paulS5949KW,"My wife and I stayed at the JW in February 2018. I am an experienced global business traveller and its not often I take the time to write a review, but this time I feel compelled. Just to thank the staff for making our stay an excellent experience. From the moment we arrived to the time we left the service was excellent and faultless. The room was to the usual high JW standard. Special thanks goes to the executive lounge team (Yoges, Sarah and Marvin) for their hospitality, for arranging an excellant table for my wife's birthday and even providing a cake. Keep it up!",5,February 2018,

Amazing Hotel,natlscales,"We stayed at this hotel before taking a cruise. Getting here from the airport was a breeze. Use the city hotel bus. It’s $9/SDG one way. The hotel itself is AMAZING! Smells great and a mile from downtown (easily a 25 min walk or a $7 can ride) The gym facilities are 5 star, with treadmills, all weight machines, and near the pool. The room itself is warming. There is a plenty of clothing space, a safe for your valuables, umbrella for the unpredictable weather. The bathroom has a bathtub, self cleaning toilet, walk in shower, and all the amenities if you left anything at home. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of major areas. Below the hotel is the subway with plenty of shopping, the train station, and the tunnels connect you to all locations. A/C control. If…",5,April 2018,
Luxury and recommended Hotel,Roam766391,"It is my first time to stay in JW South Beach, as our company are close by to this hotel so I have decided to stay. Check in is kind of a little slow I have to wait for almost 45minutes. My Friend has a lounge package which I didn’t have and I was invited by him to go up to the executive lounge which is an amazing package from breakfast to evening cocktail, the selection of food and drinks it a WOW. The staff at the lounge are all friendly as smiling at all times that’s make the place so nice.   I’ve been travelling around the world but the service I get from the lounge blown me away, I was serve by Jaquelyn she knows what a 5 stars or even 6star mean for the hotel, she has changed the experience what I usually get from other hotel she is doing such great and fantastic work with…",5,April 2018,

Room were clean and beautifully designed, food in café is awesome-selections and spread were huge and waiting staffs were very attentive, meeting rooms were bring and clean with daylight. Tea breaks were as good as a small meal.   All the staffs are attentive, polite and efficient.  We all feel very welcome every time we come back here.  And I like to specifically point out my event butler-Raj. He is AMAZING, he is always a ping away, he is very attentive to details and go all out to serve us even before we ask for help.

Awful first impression; reception service standards lacking,Fiona L,"I don’t usually have the time to write reviews but the checkin experience I just had at the JW Marriott South Beach has left me with a foul taste in my mouth. And we are first night into a 5 night stay!  We have chosen to stay here due to its fantastic location opposite the Suntec City Convention Centre where my husband and I are attending meetings and a medical conference.  We arrive at the JW Marriott in separate limousines arranged by Emirates coming off a business class flight.  It is well past midnight and I have my overtired 2 year old with me.  My limousine arrives first so I proceed to checkin immediately, hoping to get into my room as quickly as possible to tuck the children into bed.

And we dont forget Yoges at the bar every night, thankyou for the great service and entertainment. 🍹🍸 Great place overall, would highly recommend.",5,April 2018,
Nice Hotel,Hunter S,"This is a relatively new hotel but I would say that it is ‘newly refurbished’ rather than brand new. There are obvious signs that the hotel and rooms were once something other than a JW Marriott. That said, the rooms are comfortable with some very good facilities. The hotel can get a little busy, but the location is very good. We had a club room, but in comparison to other club rooms, this fell a little short. The cocktails, canapés etc were light on and somewhat disorganised. Singapore is an expensive city, and the restaurants and rooms in this hotel will evidence that. The pool has amazing views. It’s a nice hotel, but I think it needs some time to get comfortable with itself.",4,November 2017,
Excellent Property,Jishnu S,"MOre like a 4.5 rating actually.. more on that later.  Just back from the JW Marriot South Beach after staying for 3 nights for an office conference... Simply WOW. The hotel is practically brand new... modern and very swanky. The main entrance which is set against a huge LED background, the lifts with funky mood lighting, the ultra modern bathrooms, the huge spread at the Beach Road kitchen for breakfast... all made for a very favourable impression.  But at the price point it is in, and it's brand.. I have some minor grudges. The room i was allotted, 804, was really small and no view practically.. other rooms of my colleagues were decent. Would recommend higher floors and one's that face the Marina Bay area. Room 2006 had superb views and was of a good size.  Biggest grouse was…",5,April 2018,
Wonderful 2 night layover in Singapore,John K,"We are on a long trip to celebrate our 40th anniversary,  and were to transfer airlines in Singapore.  We decided to make a weekend of it, and were really glad we did. My wife has been a Marriott Platinum Elite member for many years, so she knows her Marriotts well. She agrees that this hotel excels at everything, just like Singapore does. We especially appreciated how the executive lounge hosts rolled out the red carpet. We had a 2:00 am flight to make. With a late check out, we still were travellers with hours to kill. Atiqah made sure we enjoyed a stress free evening,  and we will get on our plane for an 18 hour flight well rested. Kudos to everyone at JW Marriott South Beach.",5,April 2018,

Trendy hotel but slow check in,Adrianna Dean N,"It was our first time staying here in JW and I loved the room decor and its vibrant hotel feel.   The additional perk is that it is directly above the mrt so it has good location. There are numbers of restaurants just nearby so if you’re lazy and do not want to get room service, ample dining options are available.  Service upon check in was rather slow, one o the longest time taken apart from my other hotel experience. Perhaps the lady whom was serving was new, we were not offered any welcome drink however I see some guests having them. Although it was slow the staff was nice.  There are 2 Swimming pools but both of them are rather small to accommodate to the weekend guests. So here’s a tip: wake up at 9 and swim in the early morning, there will be lesser patrons.

My new favourite hotel in Singapore,serenehosl,"I go to many different hotels in Singapore for Staycations but I have never given the JW Marriott South Beach a try. It was by a stroke of luck that I finally decided to stay at JW Marriott South Beach. I won a 2 tickets to a culinary event, Taste of JW, and I decided to book a room so that it would be more convenient for me to get to the event. I booked a Premier Suite as I usually prefer a bigger room that can accommodate 3 adults.  We were blown away by the hotel the moment we parked our car and entered the lift lobby on the basement. The decor at the lift lobby was classy and there was a very nice scent. The lift was a work of art too with dim lighting and beautiful illuminations on the floor and wall of the lift.  When I arrived at the lobby I was very fortunate to be…",5,April 2018,
Nice hotel poor service,travel_buzzer,"Went to check out this new hotel, over a weekend with the family. Centrally located in the city and easy to access via train or cab. Walking distance to a few malls and touristy districts nearby.  Nice environment and surrounding. The old meets the new architectures. The hotel building itself is quite an art piece. The lobby decor and the wide screen at the main entrance are also quite arty farty . Inside the lifts is quite a visual show of lights that takes you into a seascape, every time the light changes we see a different marine life.  All the hard ware is impressive but... they lack efficiently that dampen our whole experience.   The check in was a i20-25min wait. It was chaotic, disorganised and confusing for guests.

We weren’t sure about including Singapore on our trip, but this hotel in itself made our trip worth it! From the very beginning, the management (Mr. Sturmayr and Ms. Chee) was super responsive to our requests. When we got there, all the staff members were very polite and helpful. Specifically, Sarah, Yogesh, and Hazel in the executive lounge were truly friendly and caring. Sarah is also so pretty! The executive lounge offers a lot, but only good if you’re planning to stay in a lot. Both the pools are beautiful with amazing views.

The staff were consistently friendly and helpful and always looking to provide assistance if needed.Our room was very modern, stylish and comfortable, up to the usual Marriott standard. We used Marriott Reward points for the booking but it was worth the extra investment to gain access to the Executive Lounge as this provides breakfast, afternoon tea, an evening light buffet and free drinks up to 9.30 pm. The staff in the Lounge were very efficient and great fun, particularly Hazel and Rio.  The  terraced area with infinity pool on the 18th floor has spectacular 360 degree views of the city.

Perfect location for a long Singapore trip,Helen S,We stayed at this hotel for 10 days and found it an excellent base to discover Singapore.  Our room was one of the best we have stayed in with all the mod cons previous trip advisors have mentioned. The hotel is very modern and we appreciated the wonderful art work on display and the funky lifts. Throughout our stay we visited the pool on the 6th floor which we found better than the pool on the 18th floor if you wanted to lay out and sun bathe. We agree that sun loungers would be an added bonus however this did not stop us from enjoying this area and taking advantage of the impressive views.  A highlight for us must be the Executive lounge and the facilities it offered. Breakfast was more than adequate and my husband particularly liked it that after the first morning Kem knew…,5,March 2018,

The club lounge is one of the best lounges with a great cheese & wine spread and other dinner options including laksa and mini hamburgers. The staff in the lounge was friendly and helpful with great overall service. The room was excellent with a bathtub and shower. In-room dining was very good and this hotel has one of my favourite club sandwiches served on sourdough with a local twist - highly recommend.

We were upgraded to a Club Level room based on the Gold status. Our room was on the 20th floor facing south.   The rooms are tiny by the American standards, but they found room for everything and the washroom is simply put the best I have seen. The Toto toilet certainly made for an interesting experience, and the large rain-shower was nice and refreshing after a day long walk...

Fantastic Location and Hotel,alliebdive,"We stayed here for three nights on the way home to the UK from Australia.  The hotel is in a brilliant location.  It's right above a metrol station and opposite the Suntec City mall.  There are lots of restaurants around the hotel and it is a short walk to India town and also the Chinese area.  We could also walk to the Marina area in about 15 minutes for the Marina mall there and the Skypark on top of the Marina Sands Hotel.  So, the area is fantastic.  The hotel is also very special.  Incredible modern design and spectacular settings - even the lifts.  Our room was not the hugest, but not as small as we feared from reviews it would be.  Plenty of room to move around.

Ok, enough about those routine goodies. This review is really dedicated to the Executive Lounge which is so amazing! Once you step in, be prepared to be amazed by excellent service from their highly passionate team and a special mention for one high-performing staff named Melvin (who saved me from a “horrible sore throat & presenting in a meeting the day after” situation)!

An amazing place to stay,Edmund,The location of the hotel is excellent. Its proximity to the circle line (Esplanade) and north south line (City Hall) makes it an ideal place to be based in for a Singapore holiday...  The hotel is part of the South Beach development along Beach Road. The hotel has a modern interior and check-in was extremely smooth... I originally booked the wrong bed type but the hotel changed the room for me on my request...  The rooms are extremely comfortable and functional.

Fantastic location and hotel,Tania W,"We had the executive lounge benefits and it was one of the best I have ever come across. it is open all day and you there is 4 hours from 5.30 - 9.30pm which is just free flowing alcohol and you serve yourself which is good. Food is from 5.30 - 7.30 and the variety is really good. Location of the hotel is perfect, so close to shopping - Raffles City and Suntec is just across the road. Pools were great however my only gripe would be that the phone on level 18 should be heated. it has an amazing view and hardly used because of the pool temperature which is such a shame. other than that, I could not fault the hotel. Staff are extremely friendly. The Tonic bar is amazing and the staff are very knowledgeable.",5,April 2018,
Great hotel and location,JPerz2014,"Stayed 2 nights on a recent business trip, great hotel, breakfast was one of the best I’ve seen and location is great too.

The staff were so friendly. A friend was having a bad cough and was offered water while waiting for me at the lobby. Our room was the beautiful marina view. Rooms are new -not exactly big but nice layout. Although the room did not have the warm cozy feeling, but we liked it. Had trouble opening the heavy bathroom doors though.

Lounge access grants breakfast, finger food twice during the afternoon and nightly drinks for free between 6:30 and 9:30pm.  There is a huge range of restaurants right in the doorstep, within the grounds of the Marriott, however they are fine class with price tag to go with it.    Service from the team was exceptional.

Highly recommend,DipeshDips,"Hotel is great. Staff are all polite, helpful and very knowledgable about the local area. Gym is massive and fully kitted out. Location is central and some restaurants near. Huge variety for Hotel breakfast. Hotel main menu needs more vegetarian options. 2 lovely pools with stunning views esp the infinity pool. Top floor pool is not used as much so better for a swim. Rooms are small so limited space for luggage but bed is so comfy and bathroom is big. Especially big praise for the incredibly  hardworking breakfast staff who always smile and are probably not appreciated enough. No complaints, would stay again. Thank you JW Marriott. ",5,March 2018,

Super Modern Hotel and Amazing Club Lounge!,TheModerness,"The day we landed in Singapore was the morning of my actual birthday (Singapore time). I had no clue at the time, but my boyfriend surprised me by getting us a beautiful corner suite. Our room was located on the 21st floor facing the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The suite was comprised of a living area, 1.5 bathrooms, a small wet bar area, and bedroom.  Our flight got in super early so we decided to try our luck to see if we could check-in early. No surprise, the room was not ready yet. Luckily though, since our room included the executive lounge, they gladly escorted us to the lounge and let us have breakfast there while we waited for our room.

Deluxe room had fleas!,HowGoodRU,"Stayed for 4 nights.  Room was small. Bathroom had a sliding mirror to allow watching TV while in Bath.  Nice thought but super impractical as one can hear every sound in the bathroom when used by another. Room had fleas flying around.  Staff were rude...  Told my colleague of mine to ""move aside"" in the lift. When reported I didn't get any feedback on the incident.  No pillow menu.  Can't believe bed was not a pocketed spring mattress and if it was a rather lousy one.  Have stayed in Marriot around the world and this is the first that I have found to be so lousy. The check in was messy as there wasn't a queue system.  Seriously needs improvement.  ",2,March 2018,
Great service at the executive lounge,KiatHong,"We stayed at JW Marriott Hotel South Beach for 10 days. Overall, we had a pleasurable experience. First, the hotel is new. Second, there is a great variety of food for breakfast at Beach Kitchen. Third, the hotel location is perfect, as it is very convenient and easy for people to visit us.  Service at the executive lounge is great. Ann, the manager, did a fabulous job in leading a team of friendly and hardworking staff who served us so well. We love the bright smile of Lavinda, Hazel, and Vivien. The afternoon tea is nice too. Strongly recommend visitors to get access to the lounge.  We certainly look forward to staying at this hotel in our next visit to Singapore.",5,March 2018,

Amazing friendly Hotel,mummymac17,"Just back from an amazing week in Singapore staying at the JW Marriot Hotel South Beach.  The hotel is situated so close to all the destinations you want to visit whilst in Singapore.  The hotel is new, clean, and has an amazing pool on the 18th floor which has uninterrupted views of Singapore and all the buildings.  The bed was amazing and huge, the bathroom complete with big bath was also huge with a rainforest shower, and the toilet that kept the seat warm for you. Loved the personal touches like small chocolates on the pillow when our bed was turned down for the night.  We were well looked after by Melvin, beautiful Hazel, Eva and Vivien just to name a few and felt like we were part of the family of the Marriot.  There is a MRT station right under the hotel so we didnt have…",5,March 2018,
Trendy and modern hotel w excellent service,TSHur,I stayed one night with my wife and 18mth old daughter. There are no kids facilities but have great 2 pools. They are not really for swimming but place for relax. (Nearby shopping malls have many kids cafe)  Interior is very modern and trendy. And it's only opened in early 2017. Staffs are very genuinely nice. Especially ones in club lounge were very friendly and helpful. I was very impressed. Food there is not exciting though.,5,December 2017,

"Very good hotel, staff are the assets that make it work.",Paul H,"OK, so where do I begin, I travel a lot, I use the Marriott because lets face it if you do travel a lot you might as well pledge allegiance to one of the chains and gain some benefits with any luck. I have posted a few times before and I only do it if it’s a really poor or excellent experience. This time it is due to excellence, and as always, its staff excellence, probably not through training, its too natural but through good choice of staff. If I’m honest hotel rooms are rooms and pools are pools. I am still in the JW Marriot, and the rooms are fine (I’m Platinum so I get some form of upgrade etc). the cleaning staff are great not because they clean well (which they do) but because they are genuinely nice guys.

Over the Top,unluckyduck,"We stayed for 3 nights using Luxury Escapes package which we bought last year. We are here to go on a cruise and thought this would be perfect way to start the holiday. We paid $1099 at a substantially 'discounted' rate. When I checked on line the prices seemed to be around the same if not slightly cheaper, which was disappointing. We were checked in fairly quickly, the lobby area is too small/narrow and can get quite crowded as a result at busy times. The room we 'upgraded' to is so tiny, even my bedroom at home is bigger! Can't walk past the foot of your bed without hitting the chair at the desk. Too many mirrors! Walls of mirrors in fact.

Came across new destination is thought of giving it a try. JW Marriott is an excellent hotel with fascinating views, very plush interiors, spacious and well appointed rooms. Score perfect 10 on location. Very centrally located with easy access from almost any side. Choice of so many bars and restaurants to go in the same compound though not part of the hotel. It’s better to book with club lounge access. Breakfast buffet was very well planned with great attention to details for a healthy meal. In between small meals were also great at the club lounge.

Great Hotel - Awesome location - Brilliant staff,zedmeister,"We spent 3 nights in the small east tower.  The location of this hotel is absolutely brilliant- you cannot get a better location.  It’s new - it’s definitely different in terms of the decor and it’s a bit awkward at times having to go from one wing to another in multiple lifts, so choose your room wisely.  We had an executive access room - the staff there were excellent - all of them but the two standouts were Melvin & Hazel - Both larger than life characters. But we should point out that all of the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and genuine.  The pool areas are incredible. The views and pool area on the 18th floor are amazing but it lacks sunshine so if you want to catch some sun go to the 6th floor of the small tower and use the infinity pool there.

The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful, especially in the Executive lounge.  When we walked into the lounge, the staff would greet us by name and they were very attentive, making sure that we had everything we wanted.  A special call out to one of the servers, Hazel!! who was so friendly, cheerful, and just a great person!  She is a keeper JW!  Can not thank her enough for making our stay so memorable.  The only disappointment at the hotel was that the water in the pool (outside) was very chilly (who would think in Singapore?) so much so that we did not want to go in.  The hotel is also very central to many of the sites, within walking distance.",5,February 2018,
An overall review but...,auntynell,"Lovely newish hotel, very modern, great location. Our room, studio in the small tower, is very nice and clean with great amenities. It is very small,  but we are grateful for the open view towards Suntec shopping centre rather than over the city or the close tower next door. No bath but a large three way bathroom, very well stocked with towels and lotions etc. the desk chair rocks, and with such a small space we were very conscious of getting toes caught as we navigated around the room. Lots of techno stuff made charging of tablets and phones easy and the wifi is good.  The two pools are amazing but not at all  conducive to laying around as only a very few sun beds (4 glamourously placed in the water in one pool) we found the pool in the small tower to be quieter but the lack of…",3,March 2018,
7 Nights of excellence.,trebor95,"What a pleasure from start to finish. Upgraded  to deluxe room with great bed and wonderful bathroom. All sparkling clean and first class WiFi.

The icing on the cake started at 17.30 until 21.30. That was a top class selection of alcoholic beverages. The staff in attendance were extremely helpful and attending. Like Ann Margareth, Melvin and Hazel, to mention a few. The two pools are worth a visit, not only for refreshing water but also for the magnificent views.

Circle Line Esplanade stop is just right downstairs with easy access to North South Line. Bus to various area of Singapore are easily available. Bugis Junction is a brisk 8 mins walk. Very convenient!  Check-in: Did online check-in via Marriott app but the room available was only twin-bed.

"Good facility, but wear sunglasses :)",Sen N,"Stayed here for five nights over New Years Eve 2017-2018. The check in agent said that I've been upgraded to a deluxe room. But I'm not sure if that was really an upgrade - my reservation said 'standard room' but there's no standard room listed on their website. The two smallest room types listed on their website are deluxe and studio. It was rather confusing.   But given that there was not enough room for a baby crib in the deluxe room, the guest service manager upgraded us to a premier room which was slightly larger with a day bed along the window. I'm thankful to the manager and my Marriott gold status that helped with the upgrade. This turned out to be the extra space we needed to stay comfortably with the kid.

Pleasurable and designed place to stay in good location with little flaws,BigMan66,"Modern and quite new hotel that comes with a few good restaurant options in the complex at street level. Our check-in experience was a bit weird as it took a real long time. In the end we got a very nice room with good views towards Marina Bay. The rooms are big and nicely desigend in a Phillipe Starck style (never had so many mirrors before....). The only strange thing was that the bed had a bedside table only on one side. Most memorable feature: the toilet, that opened itself as soon as you walked in the WC. Big bathroom, enough space to hang clothes and store away luggage.  Breakfast is at street level where you find a lot of healthy coices like fruit and different mueslis. The hotel comes with 2 different pool areas on floors 2 and 18.

Twin beds made sleeping difficult,happysun16,"Beautiful room but for 350 sgd a night I think expecting a king bed vs 2 twins is reasonable.  Lots of North Americans here for business who expect king beds.  Did the hotel run out of money when it  came time to select beds? Even doubles or queens would be better.  Also no plugs in  bath room, so strange.  Lobby is a bit of a zoo for checking out, better to do on line.   Would also have appreciated a coffee maker in room.  Breakfast is excellent, possibly best buffet in Singapore.  Pool also beautiful.   Will not be back for work unless someone can guarantee me a king bed when I reserve. ",3,March 2018,
Excellent modern hotel with service to match!,speedsister,Stayed here for 3 nights and had a club room which gave us access to the executive lounge which really made the stay! The check in was quick and efficient and our bags were delivered promptly to our room. The room wasn’t massive but it was modern clean and well designed with a great bathroom. Used the lounge extensively during our visit and staff were always very friendly and helpful and given how expensive Singapore can be to eat and drink out then having this added extra this was a definite plus! Loved the modern funky artwork and decor throughout hotel - would definitely stay here again. Pool areas were always clean and not too crowded with amazing views - although some sun loungers would have been good as only sofas so not conducive to staying for any length of time by pool.,5,March 2018,
Good Marriott hotel but average services to Gold Elite member,hippodiver,"I am a Gold Elite member and have stayed at many Marriott properties around the world.   I have also been staying at this hotel for a number of times when I am in Singapore for business as it is more convenient for me to get to my office.  As a JW Marriott property, I do no think that it provides the same level of services as other similar JW Marriott hotels. For example, I don’t think I have never got a room upgrade even though I have stayed there for 4 times.  The Executive Lounge is also average with limited F&B choices.  Given the high price, I only stay at this property because I am a loyal Marriott member.

Room was fabulous with an awesome view of the skyline of Singapore. I am particularly impressed with the staff at the executive lounge who have been very friendly and welcoming! Thanks to Lavinda, Hazel, Esther to name a few who would go an extra mile to make my stay in this hotel such a memorable one! Will definitely come back!",5,February 2018,
Elegance at its best,Terry S,"I have always be thoroughly pleased with every JW I have stayed at, whether on business or on vacation with my wife.  My first stay at the JW South Beach definitely reaffirmed my experience.  Service at its best, there, but invisible.  The little touch make the difference.  Thank you all again!",5,February 2018,
I found a friend in Singapore.,Steflazza1988,"I stayed in this beautiful property for 2 nights. I work in hotel business for many years and I travel around the word following my passion working for top level hotels. I was impressed about the facilities and the design of the hotel, really top class! Most of all the staff is very corteus and professional. Mr. HYRIZ RIZAL the bell man was incredibly friendly and very attentive. He like me has a real passion of his job and very talented in guest relations talking with each guests with his heart. He is a credit to your hotel. Also, I met him casually outside in the lobby, he approach me with his genuine smile and asked me if I had good night. I was impressed because was the end of his working day. Thank you HIRIZ RIZAL you really made my stay a wonderful experience. I wish you a…",5,February 2018,
Excellent Service,Kakai M,We stayed for a week and visited the executive lounge everyday and found the staff to be very helpful and happy especially Melvin who was very friendly and attentive and Hazel who always gave you a big smile every time. Thank you fir looking after us.,5,February 2018,
Excellent stay once again,pbozzoli,"My favorite place in Singapore. The service is always excellent. Checkin went flawless. I was upgraded in a suite, and the the bed was so comfortable. The lounge access is quite amazing. Very spacious, with a bar, and a barman will prepare your favorite cocktails. The buffet was very good with a great choice of cold and hot food.  I would definitely come come back.",5,February 2018,
Great Location,snworb,"This hotel is a combination of modern and historic. We had a club deluxe room with a king bed which was much smaller than the posted images on their web page. We moved the chair away from the desk so that we could easily gain access to both sides of the bed. Once we were settled we enjoyed this hotel and it's upscale elegance. A special thanks to Mazelan at the Concierge Desk who made travel arrangements on our behalf and Lavinda who was very friendly and efficient. It is very close to all the attractions Marina Bay, Clarke Quay etc",4,January 2018,
Fantastic hotel and location!,Pinky T,"Room is a tad small as compared to most of other Marriott hotels but considering it’s location, this is excellent for business travelers or even families. Loved their sofa which spread across the entire window sill. Suntec City shopping center was a stone throw away and has loads of restaurants, shops, supermarkets etc. Traveling time from the hotel into Raffles Place (CBD) was literally 2-3 mins by taxi and 5 mins by public bus! How great is that? Service was excellent, hotel is new so upkeep was great.  ",5,February 2018,
Fantastic Hotel,Ronald B,The hotel has everything you would want from a hotel.  The front desk was very accommodating.  The conceige was great especially Muzaffer Azrin Bin Jamil.  Helped with everything and gave us great suggestions.  The wait staff in the Beach Road kitchen was wonderful including the Executive Sous Chef Pinkie Ray.  The rooms were very modern and clean with great views.  The pool and workout rooms were excellent. There are no words to describe the hospitality and friendlyness of everyone at this hotel.  This is the place to stay in Singapore.,5,February 2018,
Amazing experience,Bilen g,"Staying at this hotel was one of the best experience I had. The hotel staff is extremely professional, courteous, and efficient. They have made our stay here extremely pleasant and was worth every minute. I especially would like to highlight one of the staff member Hafiq for his extreme professionalism and just for making our stay a memorable one from every stand point.  Thank you and we can not wait to come back!",5,February 2018,
"Nice Hotel, Kind of Busy, Centrally Located",Nikko C,"This hotel was okay -  1) The hotel was very busy on arrival and although we were checked in relatively quickly, there felt like a lot of commotion in the lobby. 2) Our room didn't have a view at all, and faced an air-conditioning unit and exterior rock garden (open air area, on the same level of hotel as our room) 3) Room had a baby crib in it for no apparent reason when we arrived, it wasn't picked up for over an hour after we called about it (again, they're busy but this is a JW) 4) Rooms are very small (even for Singapore)  Otherwise, the location is central and the pool looking South near the rooftop looked quite cool although we didn't use it.  Not horrible but could be better.",3,December 2017,
One of our favourite Marriotts.,TouringDuo,"My husband and I have been Marriott Rewards members for over 15 years and of all the Marriotts we have stayed at from Oahu to Frankfurt to Venice, to LA, San Fran, NYC Marquee Time Square......this is by far our favourite.  It's perfectly located giving easy access to all venues.  The amenities are amazing and the staff exceptional.  Special thanks to All the staff in the Executive lounge for helping to make stay amazing, with special thanks to Hazel for her warm and attentive service.",5,February 2018,
More like a W rather than a JW,Aubrey_Yang,"Pretty modern even mesmerizing decorations, which make the hotel more close to a W.  Good view from the infinite swimming pools, each in two buildings.  Maybe the best lounge breakfast I have ever had.   Interior condition is very new.",4,June 2017,
Excellent service,Lawrence V,What a great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The 18th floor pool and view are incredible. The executive lounge is a gem. Make sure to have a drink in the “Tonic.” Fitness center very well equipped.,5,February 2018,
Excellent stay!!,natalie077982,"I have stayed in an executive room (2107) for 5 nights.   First of all let me start by thanking Matin for the excellent service at the check in! He really made me feel welcome!! Matin’s professionalism and service is what a 5* hotel should be all about! Check in was in the room which was really easy!  For the rest, the room was nice. Bathroom was top notch! The executive lounge was indeed filled with people, but the service and food were excellent!  The spa treaments were great and the sauna and jacuzzi were amazing!  Overall a great, new and luxurious hotel with suntec city right next door. Marina bay is an easy 15 min walk.   Would stay here again!  ",5,February 2018,
"Good Location, but Work Needed for this New Hotel",Aus_Trav_88,"Stayed here for 2 nights during Feb 2018.  Check in was fast & friendly, with all details confirmed (including executive lounge access).  Hotel is funky, fresh & clean which is great. Unfortunately the rooms are on the small side, with it very difficult to fit 2 bags anyway to easily access them. Bathroom was really great, and potentially they have given this to much of the rooms space... I would much prefer extra space in the place I’ll be sitting over a seperate bath & shower. Bed also seemed small (I am 6foot 2) as my feet were hanging over the end, also the beds were missing a plush topper to add comfort as they were extremely firm/uncomfortable.  As with other comments the executive lounge is quite the let down, it is a big space, however it appears to many people have the…",3,February 2018,

Location is perfect - just right at the heart of the city, food everywhere including drinks.  I will definitely do stay at JW Marriott Singapore South Beach again!",5,February 2018,
Excellent 5 Star Hotel,Capt. Frank,"As a Platinum Marriott member I have had the pleasure of visiting many Marriott Hotels in my career as a Pilot. The JW Marriott Singapore South Beach is among the best I have stayed in. While the standard rooms are on the small side in comparison to most JW Marriott properties the location and hotel staff more than make up for the size of the rooms. The Executive Lounge is Excellent for variety of food and drinks. Particularly, two staff members in the Executive lounge provided special service and attention to detail. Ms. Hazel from the Philippines and Mr. Melvin Ventura also from the Philippines are arguably the most outstanding staff I have come across. To the both of you I thank you for your attention to the patrons of the Executive lounge. I recommend this hotel to anyone…",5,February 2018,
The most terrible JW Marriott ever experience,Martinpanda2017,"The location of the hotel is good. Rooms are rather small for JW. Maybe it is good as Courtyard. Went to the club lounge which I could not believed what I had experience. Went at 9:45am fir breakfast that most items were empty. I asked three the staff to replenish. The answer were the same “the chef would replenish it”. However, the breakfast closed at 10:30 that non of the items were replenished. At the end, I left with empty stomach. In addition, most tables were not clear after guests left. Really no services at all. I also came for breakfast yesterday that the situation were similar.  I would never return to this hotel again.",1,February 2018,
Excellent - except for the room fixture and furniture,Scotty2hottie,"This is my second stay at this hotel and some things, like this property, get better with age.  Here are the high notes:  The lobby and elevators exude a funky high end vibe.  The executive lounge is awesome for breakfast, snacks and dinner.  The pool and sitting areas on the 18th floor left my colleagues who were staying at another hotel in awe.  The high end food court in the bottom of the building is top rate.  The health club is very good.  The location sitting just above two malls is fantastic.  My only complaint is the choice of furniture and fixtures.  The beds are very comfortable but the chair is metal and is so uncomfortable that it can't be used to sit at the desk.  Moreover, other than the fancy Japanese toliet, the fixtures in the bathroom look very cheap.  I know…",5,February 2018,
Busy but personal,SpringZephyr,"We arrived early at 2 pm, but was told the hotel was full and to return at 3 pm, which was the listed time for check-in, which we did. The lobby had an unfortunate elongated design, which made it feel cramped but the staff made the most of it. They were serving drinks to those of us who was waiting and marshalling order in a professional yet courteous manner.  What disappointed me was the app. As a member, we get emails requesting us to use the app to check in. And I did try the app seeing the crowded lobby. However, I could not get any response from the app and was told by a staff that it was down. However, the staff quickly attended to us and we got our room in quick order.  As other TA members have attested, the rooms are functional, comfortable and a pleasure to be in. It…",5,February 2018,
Great hotel and location,whacker30,"Stayed on a recent business trip to Singapore, our team are in Singapore 3-4 times a year and this is the first time we have tried the Marriott at south beach and we were very impressed  Really helpful staff and a really high standard of care, always friendly. The executive lounge on level 2 is really great for breakfast and also an early afternoon  bite to eat before any additional appointments we had, the staff here were great and made an effort remembering our names after the first day   Rooms were really modern and facilities in the hotel also great   Definitely will be our hotel of choice when returning in May ",5,February 2018,
Singapore Feb 2018,Pac060151,"Such a Great Hotel, Fabulous location right in the centre of town with easy access to the MRT,  staff were very helpful and nothing to much for them. We had a great breakfast in the Executive lounge each day with afternoon tea available on our return in the afternoons. Would highly recommend this Hotel!!",5,February 2018,
Great hotel w wonderful service 👍🏻,JoleneZhou,"Had a night stay at the deluxe room last weekend and I love how new everything is. Bathtub was huge!   Was late for breakfast the next morning and only arrived 10 mins before it ended. The ground staff made sure we had enough food and kept coming to check on us before they kept the food.   Also, one of the receptionists Charmaine was very professional and her service is absolutely top notch. Will be back :)",5,February 2018,
Loved this place,Lewis A,The hotel is beautiful and oozing of Phillipe Stark's design. The rooms are a bit small but very well organised. The bathrooms are amazing despite only having one basin. Loved the self cleaning and drying heated loo seats. I want one!  The two pools are nice but have no place to lie out in the sun. What a shame to spend so much on rooftop pools but have no sun loungers.,5,February 2018,
Amazing Stay,Dushy S,"This is now my favourite hotel in Singapore, the rooms, the club lounge and service from the staff throughout the hotel is fabulous. I had stayed here twice once before Chinese New Year and on my way back to Melbourne from the 14-16th during the peak. Even though the hotel was at full capacity the service level could not be faulted. If you like your G&T the tonic bar is definitely worth a visit, the food at the beach road kitchen is divine. The Indian breakfast Upma and Sambar is like it’s home made. The chicken rice and Nasi lemak gives Penang a run for its money. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this property. Found my hotel in Singapore for my future trips. The location is great 2 minutes to MRT. ",5,February 2018,
5 Night Stay in January,briantaylormail,"Relatively new hi-tech, luxury hotel, where we found the location, service and staff to be excellent.  Wide choice of bars and restaurants at the hotel, and the dinner buffet at its South Beach Kitchen restaurant was outstanding.  Whilst expensive, it is very good value. The buffet breakfast at this restaurant is extremely good too and we had numerous examples of good service from the welcoming and very accommodating staff and chefs. The views of Singapore from the pool area on the 18th floor are breath-taking. The hotel is a very short walk from the starting point for Singapore tours by open-top buses and the ""Duck"" tours.",5,January 2018,
Expensive hotel with little flexibility,Jai S,"The Hotel is relatively new and therefore very modern and rooms pretty hi tech. However, I found the service and attitude of staff and management little cold and less flexible. I am a member of Marriott reward program with over 65,000 points but neither I could use them to upgrade my room nor I was allowed access to lounge facilities. I believe, the hotel should be all about service, attitude and quality...and this one falls short on 2 of the 3 main ingredients. Will think twice  before booking here again or recommending to someone else.....",3,January 2018,
Quick Vacation To Singapore,Gman D,"From the 2nd level executive lounge we found a resource that was amazing with her service.

Great stay,tvainio,New and modern luxury hotel. Amazing views of Singapore City from the Flow18 (pool on the 18th Flr.) Maybe too modern but really good for business. Nice and great technology features for controlling the room.  Elite status worked very well here.  Access to Executive Lounge gives everything.  Also 4 pm late checkout was arranged which was very good.  At the last day we had a nice multi hour mid day visit to the city and we were able to use room shower one more time. This 4 hour extension means a lot.  We had a mid night flight so we had lot of time to do more shopping 4-8pm and after this they offered Flow18 facilities for refreshment before heading to the airport.  Executive Lounge folks really nailed it.  Offering was so good that we even skipped one dinner.  Special thanks to…,5,February 2018,

Best view of Singapore but hotel could be better maintained,eugenexsamantha,Stayed in a premier room in February 2018. Below is a summary of what we liked and did not like about the hotel:   What we like: - Room is spacious and clean  - Bath tub was of a comfortable size (my husband about 1.84m and he could stretch his legs out onto the tub)  - Scenic view (really the best of Singapore's skyline that is better than Marina Bay Sands as the buildings are more 'in your face' rather than MBS' whereby the buildings are viewed from afar)  - Great location (the MRT station is one minute walk away and well integrated with the building and it connects you to three major malls) - Well-equipped gym   What we did not like:  - Pool on Level 18 was very cold and not suitable for kids especially  - There was another pool on the other wing of the building but it was…,4,February 2018,

My new favorite hotel In Singapore,kkn889,"It’s perfect in every aspect. Great art everywhere. Nice rooms with great but simple and easy to use technology.

Wonderful Stay at a Beautiful Hotel,Michael M,This hotel was amazing!! Great location with easy access to the subway system. Modern hotel with a beautiful poolside view on the 18th floor. The staff was super friendly -- we were served by Melvin and Hazel in the executive lounge several times and were blown away by their helpful and friendliness. We can't wait to come back!,5,January 2018,
Different take on hotel,MrGJK,Hotel is up there with very good JW Marriotts around the world.  Interesting layout with the reception and restaurants being being in different buildings.  (Making the hotel reception too small - narrow - for the hotel).  Rooms very nice - bit blingy with loads of mirrors - but quite small.  Good bathrooms.  Comfortable beds.  Very smooth and fast lifts.  Swimming pool has great view but a bit cold and nowhere to relax around it really.  Very well equipped gym.  Breakfast was a bit of a bun-fight.  Way too many people for the restaurant to cope but the food itself was very good with wide selection.  Hotel is very well situated close to Suntec City and SMRT.  Staff were very good - even wishing my Happy Birthday!,4,February 2018,
Disappointing,Ian J,The thing that makes this a 3 star not a 2 star is the nice handwritten notes from housekeeping (Maya) that partly restored my faith that Singapore can still do customer service.  The lobby area is long and thin making it a bit odd and not particularly welcoming.  Check in was odd. All staff appeared to be free but I was asked to wait until an agent was available?? Shortly after this one was and I checked in. Check in wasn't entirely painless as the group organiser had me listed as checking in a day early so my booking couldn't be found initially. Not the hotel's fault admittedly.  As others have said the lift is a little psychedelic with the colour coded ascent and descent lighting.  On entry to the room the first thing that hits you is the graffiti pretending to be modern art…,3,February 2018,
Top JW globally...,davidhouser,"It is really hard to find a flaw with this property.  Views, eats, location.....and the property is ‘currently cool’ and updated.  Just love it and so will you.  Walking or biking gets you to great additional restaurants, shopping and water-side attractions.  If you are a JW fan as I am globally, this one is a special gem.",5,February 2018,
Best spa in Singapore,SVRBlackBookAsia,"Lovely rooms with panoramic views of the city. Easy access to many shopping Malls and restaurants. Very convenient to and from the airport as well. Must try is the hotels spa, well maintain facilities and good quality products used. Plus their zero gravity chairs!!",5,November 2017,
Perfection,Bill M,"This hotel nails it !!! All of the staff are excellent and true professions: the reception staff, the Executive Lounge folks, the Fitness staff all go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay.   The Executive Lounge is outstanding and huge with a variety of sitting options. The breakfast food is varied and very good. In the evening, the food could easily double as your dinner. Never have understood which Marriott lounges have complimentary adult beverages and which do not. This lounge does and it's a great variety. The 18th floor infinite pool area is huge, again with multiple seating scenarios and outstanding views. The fitness area serves the purpose and the MRT is a few meters away.  The rooms are definitely unique and high tech. At first, didn't seem functional…",5,February 2018,
Not a Marriott Like We Know,Jeff N,"The hotel is new and updated but as a member that stays mostly at other JW Marriotts, I was a bit surprised upon entering the hotel.  The lobby is extremely small meaning it’s hard to stand in line to check in or out of the hotel.  There is no room for guests to walk by the counters if someone is being helped at the counters.  On the plus side, the staff are very friendly and willing to help.    The rooms were a bit shocking as the size of the bathroom is like the lobby below where if you are brushing your teeth at the sink, there is no room for someone to pass by you to use the toilet of shower.  The showers are extremely plain with no accommodations to place your wash clothes or soap on while showering.  I was disappointed that there are no hand holds to hold until while…",2,February 2018,

There are various restaurants close to the hotel in various price categories. You can also walked in an aircon walkway to the fantastic Esplanade theater.

I must rate the staff as really excellent - everyone we interacted with was really helpful, efficient and courteous.  The lobby has a massive display as you walk in which at times had a mesmerising mix of colours at times. Check in was very efficient. The lobby is long and narrow which makes it feel a touch congested. Lifts have multicolour lights which are a bit trippy!  The room was well laid out with good storage and a comfortable bed, if slightly on the firm side. The bathroom had a very comfortable bath and great shower.

The staffs are all friendly and very attentive to details.

Great visit,TNinMontreal,"I was in Singapore for a week on business travel. I stayed at the JW South Beach, and I wasn’t disappointed. Check-in was very efficient. As a Gold Member, I used the lounge frequently.  Esther and her colleagues were fantastic. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is very welcoming, and I didn’t find it crowded like some other lounges in Asia. One slight issue - the battery on my door lock died. So I was locked out of my room for 20 minutes while the engineering department sorted that out. Room is great, staff are friendly. Definitely a great stay. ",5,February 2018,
Outstanding,Subrus,"Located opposite the office cum convention hub, Suntec City, this is well located. Plus you can use either the City MRT or Esplanade MRT to commute. The latter has an entrance in the same complex as the hotel. The building uses a local of cues from the start up styles prevalent, with rough cement flooring in the lounge with aluminium chairs to badly finished walls behind the reception.  Even the lift lighting changes based on arrival and departure. However, it doesn't compromise on luxury accents. The Wi-Fi is fast and easy to access. Room had PED power points at bedside. And international ones too, and not the painful Singapore ones. Toilet was a brilliant automated Toto with all the bells and whistles. This is perhaps the best feature of the hotel. All and all, a memorable…",5,February 2018,
Great Gem!,Wellington L,"Just stayed at the JW for a trip with my girlfriend! It had a great view of Singapore! We are gold Marriott members and had access to the executive lounge. We had breakfast, appetizers and drinks on a daily basis. It def made our trip! Special shout to all the staff in the executive lounge as well as Vaibhav who made the breakfast experience more memorable. He was very attentive and friendly! Thank you!!  The only negative of the hotel is the pool area. While the the views from the pool are amazing, not being able to drink in the pool, no chair or tables to put your belongings by the pool, as well as the frigid cold water in the pool made the pool experience sub par.  Still overall it's a great hotel!",5,February 2018,

Where to begin with how wonderful this JW is???,David L,"I've been traveling to SG a few times/year for 20 years but I just stayed at the new JW a couple times recently. I hardly know where to begin with my rave reviews of the whole experience.  Others have aptly described the beautiful decor, cool vibe, food, executive lounge etc. So instead, I'll focus my accolades for the staff, who are truly the ones who make it exceptional. Granted, hospitality across Asia is excellent more often than not but the JW South Beach takes it to a new level. And it's not that forced ""I'm supposed to be nice to you"" hospitality. It comes off as very genuine with the staff really taking the time to know you as a guest and as a fellow human being.

My 6year old girl decided to end her dinner early and started with desserts. As she wander off herself, im surprised that the serving staffs actually attended to her wants.

Room is spacious-we stayed in a handicap accessible room with a roll-in shower and a beautiful view. Housekeeping is on point everyday-thank you! They never missed a day or opportunity to provide a clean room with all the necessities.  Must mention a few folks: Tak-receptions; Deborah & Charmaine-Concierge; Hazel & all the ladies and gents of the Executive Lounge. The folks greeting you as you arrive from a long flight are quick and attentive.  If you’re here on business the exec lounge is large with plenty of quiet spaces and wasn’t crowded during any of our…,5,February 2018,
New hotel...bit too modern,VCG,"I just finished my stay here. It was new so wanted to try it. As a platinum member I normally get a suite upgrade but here they gave me a room with a view as they said to be sold out. I was fine as it was one night. I also get lounge access.   Their platinum lounge has a v liberal policy of 4 hours of evening cocktails. I was disappointed with the choice of alcohol as most of it was bottom shelf. Absolut vodka & beefeater gin!! I must here commend a staff member, vaibhav. He was very attentive and bought us drinks even though it was a self serve bar.   The room is sparse. Not too much furniture; very small night table; only one one side! The bathroom had a very high tech wC! I’m sure it was expensive but not the most practical thing. The darn thing beeped every 5-10 minutes all…",4,January 2018,
Nice ball room,Silverstone90,"Went for my Cousin wedding dinner last weekend. I would said that these foods were great and the ball room was nice, like a fairy tales. However the staffs doesn’t really attentive, we need to ask them to refill our drink and sometime they missed out to served certain people in the table. ",4,January 2018,
Excellent Hotel,Alex280181,"We stayed in the JW Marriott in Singapore for 2 days. I have seen a lot of Marriotts across the globe but this one is for sure one of the best for my point of view. Very friendly stuff, great service, nice, quite and clean rooms. We will definitely come back. ",5,January 2018,
"Nice location, newer rooms, staff is highly attentive",WKU7818224,"Good visit and spent extra time after meetings with my wife for a few days following.  Enjoyed the pools—preferred the one on 6th floor versus 18th floor because seating is actually beside / around pool (like you would expect).  Plus, there was hardly anyone using during the week that I was there.  Gym is also good and they are thorough in keeping it well maintained.   Cons for me were minimal:  Overall hotel is darker than I like in trying to be more contemporary.  Lobby design is really strange with small galley type approach.  Not functional or inviting, despite staff attempts to overcome with their warm smiles and hospitality.   Would return here again when back in Singapore. ",4,January 2018,
"Good location, rooms not as great",Arunachalam10,"Great location near two subway stops, and several huge malls with anything you could need are a very short walking distance. Hotel is also close and convenient to airport. Quiet with carpets in hallways and rooms. Very cool Philippe Starck designs in public areas, the elevators are something to see! But modern designs in the room not as practical or comfortable (rocking desk chair!)  Room was one of the smallest I've ever seen in a Marriott! Two chairs (a desk and sort of sitting chair) were probably too much, so tight. Teeny weeny little bedside stands.   ""Moveable"" mirror panel design allows the room to be opened up to the bathroom just above the mini bar fridge, but not sure why this is a perk...this allowed noise from the bathroom to disturb another person who may be…",3,January 2018,

Really Comfortable Beds,ScotByChoice,"I had a one night stay at this property, and architecturally, it is stunning from the outside.  Inside, it is a modern luxury hotel that lives up to the JWM standard.  I purchased a ""Club Level"" room so I could use the Executive Lounge.  The Lounge was a large space with plenty of variety in food and drinks.  I'd like to make mention of the mattress and bedding that were extremely comfortable.  This hotel is in close proximity to the Esplanade MRT station, so it is handy for sightseeing by subway.  The downside, from my perspective, the property is a bit pricey.",5,January 2018,
Nothing to fault!,charla06,"I highly recommend to stay here when visiting Singapore. Very central, hotel is almost brand new (Best bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel), all the staff are very friendly. We enjoyed the pools even though they were fairly cool and the service at the lounge was fabulous! I would like to give a special mention to Saravanan for giving great directions and recommendations.

"Excellent in Swimming pool, breakfast, and kindness",studentjune2015,"The hotel has excellent swimming pools. Their views were wonderful! The other outstanding one was breakfast! The breakfast was the world best one. It combined Western and Eastern foods. Various choices and fresh. It was just awesome! Last, all the staffs I've met in the hotel were very kind and helpful. I'd like to give my special thank you to Mr. Johnny.",5,January 2018,
Too bad,travellerC5001SD,"Hotel itself is new and clean but...  I could not come in my room three times during my 4 night stay.  A card key worked but the door handle did not move.  I asked hotel staffs to come and open it. It took 10 minutes every time to open it.  They tried to open the door by pushing a door and turning hard a handle.  If lucky, the door opens. Once the door opened, the staff touched somewhere in the handle and said ""it will be ok"" but it was not ok.  That's really annoying and frustrating.   In addition, my sleep was disturbed by two very loud false fire alarms in midnight...  At check-out, the front desk asked how was the stay, and I provided honest feedback. He apologized it but that's it.  Apology is important but it just reminded bad experiences and did not help at all to release…",1,January 2018,
Another great J W property,David L,"Spew spent 6nights with this great hotel. Staff are truly wonderful and helpful.  We are platinum with Marriott and the concierge lounge is wonderful -breakfast is fantastic +0-thank you. Definitely enjoy a coffee or cocktail on the 18th floor and enjoy the open air views of the harbor. Great location, nearMarina Bay but not in the middle of it all.",5,January 2018,
Event Planner/travel agent,Audrey1126,"I had the pleasure of staying at the JW Marriott Singapore South Beach this past week. As an event planner who has done many site visits all over the world (in many beautiful places, hotels, and resorts) I look at hotels through different eyes. The staff I encountered (front desk, executive lounge, restaurant, housekeeping, etc.)were all extremely helpful, courteous, and caring. Hazel and Vaibhav in the Executive Lounge are standouts. You know it is an outstanding place when you start out as strangers, but quickly feel more like family. I started my mornings with breakfast in the lounge, and most days ended it there at happy hour.  The hotel is ideally located. There are many restaurants and a lot shopping nearby. Of course, Singapore is easily explored with their amazing public…",5,January 2018,
Amazing hospitality!,Dae-In C,"I walked into the hotel in search for a coffee shop, and to also explore since the building is architecturally interesting.  Amamda, the hotel staff, approached me kindly to offer any help she can.  She not only showed me to the coffee shops, but also offered me wifi access, and suggested that she store my luggage (because I was walking around with my handful).  Really touched by her sincere hospitality.  Definitely wanting to come with family for my next stay in Singapore!  The hotel complex is also really cool and groovy too, with hip bars and restaurants.",5,January 2018,
Fantastic Hotel in Central Singapore,FredRo1948,"This was my second stay at the JW Marriott in Singapore, the first having been shortly after they opened. At that time it was a wonderful hotel, but it has now taken the next step to superb! From airport transfer to checkin to room upgrade (I am lifetime Platinum Marriott  Rewards customer) to the friendly hellos from every staff member you passed, this hotel made the experience of staying a dream! Staff were eager to please, professional, and carried out every request promptly and efficiently. The Executive Lounge where we had breakfast is one of the best I have encountered in the Marriott system. At checkout an extra breakfast charge that had been added due us checking in well before checking time, was promptly removed without me even being informed that it was on the bill…",5,January 2018,
Thumbs up to the staff working in Executive Lounge & Spa!,mshuiling M,"The service received from the Front Office staff and the concierge was quite awful initially, but Ann Margareth and Jeslyn from Executive Lounge and Spa by JW definitely made my stay much better!  I requested for a recee of the Premier suite prior to my stay and it was handled well by the reservations team. I have repeated emphasized that this staycation is meant for my brother's proposal, so it will be great if the hotel can do something about it. I've informed the reservations team and front office (that guy who brought us to recee the suite) on this yet it wasn't communicated well among the inter-departments on that day.   Upon check-in, I noticed that the front office were understaffed and unfortunately, the service received was mediocre. When I wanted to confirm on the late…",4,January 2018,
beautiful and fancy place,Zuleka D,This hotel is nice and located in good spot near MRT and plenty of shopping malls and very friendly staff. at evening they will put you chocolate with note in your bed side and i loved that!  great breakfast options with Asian cusine and different types. they also have afternoon tea,5,August 2017,
Great Staycation Expeience,UpperGuest,"Spent a night at JW Marriott South Beach to experience this new hotel. The hotel is easily accessible via Esplanade  MRT and strategically located near marina shopping Malls, Suntec and raffles shopping centre. Was complimentary upgraded to the duluxe suite as a Platinum Elite member. Checkin was smooth and the suite is trendy, comfy and clean. Unlike the usual club lounge in Marriott chain, the concept for JW Marriott South Beach is colourful and trendy. Afternoon tea, evening cocktail and buffet were ok but would be better if the choice of food is more. Friendly and professional staff and always greet you with a smile Great hotel for family staycation!  Dr E Chow",5,January 2018,
Perfect,Sonia T,"Very nice hotel! The service and hotel amenities were excellent. The staff were very welcoming. We booked a rate including access to the Executive Lounge.

The room was very comfortable with great amenities.",5,January 2018,
Terrible Service & Musty Rooms,Oliviaccn,"About me: Spg platinum since 2013; primarily travels for business; often seen in Westin and Sheraton  Booked at this hotel for 2 adults and 1 baby, and provided my Marriott rewards number that was already status matched with my spg platinum.   Check in staff was very cold and borderline rude. I was questioned about my membership status as if I lied about my platinum, was asked for my spg number and said that number doesn't work in his system (of course I knew it wouldn't). Also at this point the Marriott app did not work so there was no way I could retrieve my Marriott membership number. Finally I showed him my spg platinum membership card and he reluctantly granted me access to the privileges, which was mainly the lounge.  Next up, went into the room and found 2 single beds! So…",1,January 2018,
Loved it!!!,Ruth U,"The service,  the people,  and the ammenites were excellent.   I would highly recommend this beautiful hotel.   The food was great in the executive lounge.

Excellent Stay Experience at the JW Marriott Hotel South Beach Singapore!,boo_tofu,"A beautiful hotel with a set of very attentive and friendly staff! The JW Marriott South Beach is tastefully designed with stylish decor and very conveniently located within walking distance to most of the landmarks in Singapore! Connected to the Esplanade MRT Station and to the Sun Tec City Mall, this makes it so accessible and convenient to business and leisure travelers alike.  We were warmly greeted and cared for by the Concierge team led by Ian, and enjoyed the warm hospitality by the Club Lounge crew, which our room had access to.  Our room had a great view of the iconic Marina Bay Sands, and was very spacious and tastefully designed.   Due to our hectic schedule, did not get to utilize the other facilities within the hotel, but we were impressed by the pool and the…",5,January 2018,
Wanted to like everything about JW South Beach Singapore,snowshoedude,"JW's tend to be pretty solid. The JW South Beach Sing is - kind of - maybe more like jello in some cases.  PROS:  1. Solid housekeeping keeping your room clean and fully stocked with shampoo, towels, drinking water, with turn downs without fail 2. Executive lounge with very good breakfast presentation and great staff. The omlet chef remembered my preference after day 2. The staff there was solid. 3. Some  nice interior design in public areas 4. Excellent location near Gardens by the Bay, shopping, ans reasonable walks to good restaurants 5. Good sized bathroom including bath tub and separate shower 6. Got 4pm checkout so good to see that platinum benefit honored  CONS  1. Potentially noisy rooms - the windows must be very thin as you can hear a lot of noise, especially on the…",4,January 2018,
Fun Marriott,3Xaroundtheworld,"Stayed in JW Marriott around the world and a couple of times with JW Marriott South Beach. Very different from the classy JW Marriott that you would find. JE Marriott South Beach has a more fun, club-like feel to it probably because it took over and operate from the boutique hotel. Being a platinum elite member, perks and upgrades is really nothing to shout about compared to what One would be getting from other Marriotts. Location wise is fantastic though with the MRT and malls within minutes of walk.",4,December 2017,
Great service from Hazel,annabella.post,"Hazel in the exec lounge is amazing.  Customer focus always smiling，very warm,  joy to be around!  Hope to come back to see Hazel again.   Rooms are very nice, modern contemporary feel to it.  House keeping is very efficient too!  ",5,January 2018,

From the entrance to the modern artwork that is so mesmerising and all the amazing features this hotel will not disappoint. A comfortable room with everything that is needed for a wonderful stay.

Impeccable service and stay from JW Marriott Singapore,Gurmeet K,"Service is unbeatable, all the staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. Our flight reached early morning, and Johnny at the reception was very helpful and gave us early check in. Excellent room service, they clean the room at least twice per day. Sue did an excellent job.  Excellent food, as we are vegetarians Chef Chen, Ken  and  Dharma took special care of me and my family. Special thanks to Dharma who prepared all the dishes for us. Hazel in the executive lounge is very friendly and always greets us with big smile, every time we are there. We go on holiday every six months but we are so happy and impressed with Marriott south beach services, and pleased to say that the stay we have had at the JW Marriott, South Beach, Singapore. Will definitely recommend this hotel. 10…",5,January 2018,

A truly modern luxury,FarahGasser,"When I tried skeptically checked into JW Marriott Singapore South Beach, I am very particular with courteous services. I was blown away by the artsy modern luxury with excellent services of this hotel. Ever since I never look back to my old hotel in Singapore where I used to be a loyal guest for the longest time.   I am a constant traveler and I pick up easily if a good service is truly from the heart, or the staff just doing it for the sake of their job. Fortunately, this property with an excellent service did not disappoint me at all yet naturally encouraged me to extend more nights everytime I visited Singapore. This property is my new home away from home. The excellent services from the Porter, housekeeper, executive lounge staff to the front desk receptionist and concierge…",5,January 2018,
JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach,Hanabanna23,"Stayed in the hotel for 5 nights.  Location was perfect for it was close to lots of tourist attractions.  Walkable to the Suntec, Marina Square and Raffles City which was great for shopping.  Little India, Arab Street and Bugis market can also be easily reach from this location.  The rooms were good, bed comfortable and nice bathroom.  The whole building area had a great focal point location in all directions.   Pool has a great view of the city also.  The lounge was okay but can improve more.  Breakfast was okay but the evening hors d'oeuvre can be improve a lot more.  On the 3rd night we got tired going to the lounge and opted to find food elsewhere.  Luckily restaurants were not hard to find in the area.   We enjoyed Singapore before our 7 day cruise.

Lobby is super spacious & welcoming, love the hanging candles (LED lights..but look magically real!), the front desk service was top speedy. Quick walk over to Suntec for food & shopping.

OMG Awesome Hotel,Kakidu,"We stayed at both the Marriott Tang Plaza and then the JW. Both nice experiences, but the JW is a must-see. Gorgeous modern hotel with computerized lighting, curtains, and even toilets. Gorgeous views, especially from the floors with the outdoor areas and rooftop pools. Nice surrounding areas with bars and recreational things to do. Pools were very cold (heating them would be a nice touch!). Very nice executive lounge with LOTS of different options for food and drink. The area surrounding the hotel was also VERY nice for walking around and shopping, with covered walkways to a huge modern mall and the MRT.",5,December 2017,
