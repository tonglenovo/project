A must experience to do,8,"We had a deluxe room with a balcony that looked across the marina towards the Marina Sands Hotel.  Our king bed was v comfortable and hard to get out of most days.  The room was spacious with well appointed lighting, there were power sockets with USB charging and HDMI ports.  Our USB charging outputs did not work, but we are prepared for those moments by taking a multi power box with USB charging and plenty of adaptors (UK fittings for SG).  There is only one power socket beside the bed so you need an extra long cord if you want to charge your devices from the bedside without a power socket.  There were two phones in the room if your using the work station. The real treat is the shower, 3 types to choose from, rain, spa and hand.  Hotel location is perfect with corridors to the shopping malls, MRT Promenade is a 5 min walk.  Here is the small things that need improvement, room service is too slow, it took an hour for a toasted sandwich and the order was still wrong, the trolley sat outside the room for near to 24 hrs, I took it back to reception.  You dont get any reward points unless you book direct.  My partner had strained a knee muscle and the team was amazing and caring we got all the support needed.  However sometimes you need to explore your requests a little more deeply with the right person in order to get what you reasonably need, ask to speak to someone who knows the system a bit better.  Overall it was worth every cent and we will go back.","as above, not much really.",Ramon2022,Couple,Deluxe King or Twin Room,6,"2, 2022",New Zealand,nz,[List]

思ってたよりとても快適なホテル,10,これまでに、シンガポールでは、シャングリラ、リッツカールトン、マンダリンオリエンタルに宿泊しています。シャングリラ以外は、クラブアクセス付きの部屋を選び、それぞれとても快適でした。でも、今回のパンパシフィックシンガポールでは、スタッフの温かい対応にとても助けられました。パシフィッククラブのお部屋に宿泊しましたが、おそらくその中では一番お得なお部屋を選んでいましたが、パシフィッククラブのすぐ下の35階にしてくれました。初めての一人旅でしたが、とても快適に安心して過ごせました。到着後のレセプションのスタッフが、皆さんとてもおもてなし感を持っている対応をしてくれました。特に、日本人スタッフのAさん、お名前を覚えられなかったけど、ランチの時間が過ぎても、絵本を売っているお店を探してくれた、同じくAから始まるお名前の若い女性スタッフ、入口のベルボーイスタッフ、プール入口のスタッフ、とてもとても優しくフレンドリーに、そして親身に接していただけて、ぜひまた宿泊したいと思いました。正直、これまではリッツカールトンが一番だと思ってましたが、パンパシフィックシンガポールの大ファンになりました。朝食がレストランもクラブラウンジも利用できたのも良かったです。お部屋の冷蔵庫のアルコール以外のソフトドリンク、スナックが全部無料だったことも良かったです。パシフィッククラブラウンジのシャンパンがテタンジェとローランペリエだったのが最高でした。,パシフィッククラブでなかなかオーダーを取りに来なかったことです。360度展望のフロアーで目が行き届かなかったのでしょうか、それとも英語が堪能でない私に近づきにくかったのでしょうか、カクテルアワー、朝食、アフタヌーンティーと三度行きましたが、全て自分でドリンクをオーダーしに行きました。クラブラウンジでは、着席したらまずドリンクだと思っている私には、あまり快適な場所ではありませんでした。女性スタッフの方はお代わりなど何度も聞きには来てくれましたが、スーツを着た男性スタッフの動きがもう少し気配りがあっても良かったと思います。その点は他のホテルより劣っていたところだと思います。次は、ラウンジアクセス付きのお部屋でなくてもいいなと思いました。,Anonymous,Solo traveler,,1,"3, 2019",Japan,jp,[List]

Unser Aufenthalt erstreckte sich über 9 Tage, durch 2 aufeinanderfolgende Buchungen via Booking.com. In diesen 9 Tagen waren wir 10 mal an der Rezeption/Concierge um darum zu bitten (manchmal 2 mal pro Tag) das unsere Minibar aufgefüllt wird (welche im Clublevel inkl. ist). Sowas nervt schon beim 3 Mal, aber 10 Mal....
Desweiteren fragt man sich oft, wofür genau an manchen Einrichtungen Personal stationiert wird, wie z.B. im Fitnesscenter. Hier stehen 2 Mitarbeiter die sich miteinander unterhalten. Es gibt keine Einführung in die Geräte für Gäste oder sont irgend etwas was man als Service am Gast bezeichnen könnte (Getränke oder Handtücher könnten evt. gerreicht werden!?). Nach 5 Minuten im Fitnesscenter sind die 2 Herren dann auch rausgegangen um ihren Smalltalk mit dem Poolpersonal zu vertiefen und nach 15 Minuten war von den 3 Mitarbeitern weit und breit nichts mehr zu sehen für die nächste Stunde.

Персонал - отличный!","В номере кофе-машина, но капсулы на нее не продаются. Можно просить на ресепшн. Если не просить - дают 3 разных капсулы в день. Завтрак за отдельную плату - ужас!!! Либо берите включено ""шведский стол"", либо на фуд-корт рядом - там с 08.00 на любой вкус, от круассанов до азиатской еды. В ТВ нет русских каналов. Туристов много, но карты достопримечательностей отсутствуют. Доступ на этажи только по карте - если вы живете на 24 этаже, то на последний этаж (посмотреть панораму) и в клуб наверху вас не пустят. Ну что за чушь, а?! Можно подумать на этажах ниже отель не 5 звезд, а 3.

We also called the front desk to ask for a bucket of ice, however it was verbalised that we have to pay $5 for that unless we went down to the reception area to take it ourselves & then only it will be free.

Lacklustre,6,Great location. Request for housekeeping was quite prompt. Skyline suite has a great view and the room size is quite value for money for the price.,"Maybe it's the new covid-19 normal where understaffing have caused a lot of problems, but having booked the skyline suite, it's quite unfathomable that there isn't any cutlery available at all in the room, neither can it be delivered to your room at all unless you order in-room dining. If you want cutlery, you have to take it yourself at the Pacific Marketplace. Can't the disposable cutlery packs be placed in the more premium rooms and suites? Some basic forks, knives and spoons and all? Same for ice. If you want ice, you get it yourself from level 1 (bit of a drag when you're at level 30), or pay $5 for it to be sent to your room. Just for ice! 5-star hotel and you have to carry a bucket of ice from the first floor to the 30th floor. For a suite, the amenities and facilities are lacklustre and not well-maintained: JBL speaker in the room malfunctioned after one day. Tap in the small bathroom leaked non-stop (faulty amenities like leaky taps are a major cause of water wastage). The fridge is TINY. If you want to chill bottles of sparkling water and wine it's gonna be a struggle. There was a small piece of something on the bathroom stall that remained there FOR 3 DAYS, and because I had some groundnuts, there were some debris on the carpet WHICH WERE STILL THERE THE NEXT DAY even after the room had been made up, it had not been vacuumed. The houskeeping really isn't thorough at all. I think the housekeeping is the part I'm the least happy with.

Unpleasant experience.,1,,"Poor service, which could not keep up with the demand. I had to unload my own luggage from the car. Furthermore, check in took 30 min. I was told to go down and get my own utensils from my room. If not I would be charged $10 per trip for service. When I ordered room service, the food was just left at the door. I had to push in the food myself, set up the table myself and take out the food from the warmer myself. Coffee machine was not in the room, as I was told it is not included in my package. Minutes later, they brought it to my room as it was actually apart of my package. Extremely slow response to call operator, avg 3 - 5 min wait. Coming from a 5 star hotel point of view. I would never go back. Staff all gave different reasons for the same issue. It seems that the management has no clear SOP. I wanted to go to the pool side with my family for a walk at 8pm, and it was closed, when it was stated that its open till 1030pm.",Shiv,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room with Balcony,2,"16, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]
Poor check-in process: standing nightmare,7,"I love everything about the property.

It was easy to requests for missing items and staff are always friendly and polite. 
Rooms are also clean, even tho we found one baby roach scurrying in a corner but i guess it was okay. 
Bathrooms are also great, squeaky clean & toilet is equipped with bidet (yay to hygiene!!!)
Location was great, in the midst of shopping complexes and hence plenty of food options in case one gets hungry at different timings of the day.","The check-in process. 
Hotel shld hv pre-empted themselves with the influx of local staycationers. Hotel explained that the check-in process was longer than usual due to covid safe management measures but the crowd they had at the lobby defies all measures. 
It was a ‘party’ for covid virus if there was any among us. 
My family started queueing at 3pm and only were checked-in at 5-ish that laye afternoon, having to settle for another room as our requested room wasnt ready (despite being given a checked-in timeslot of 3.30pm).
Feel that there was absolutely a lack of pre-emptive planning and communications with the guests. What more, safe-distancing measures. 
All of these could be avoided with a pre-checked-in email and data collation prior to the stay. Or perhaps staggered check-in timings? 
I guess the pandemic may have caused the hotel to forget how to best serve their guests since there were relatively lesser prior to the hols. 
Although the stay was a wonderful experience, it was marred by the unpleasant ‘first-encounter’ at the check-in counter. 
Thanks.",Sharizan,Family,Harbor Studio,2,"16, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]
Very Poor,2,,"Terrible management. In the email they sent me, it stated that guests were to check in at different time slots and my slot was at 4.30pm. Turns out due to the miscommunication by their management, all the guests for that day all guest were told to check in at 4.30pm. On top of that there was an extremely poor management of the situation and social distancing rules were not enforced. There were no staff available to manage the queues and ensure that guests stood 1m apart.
Furthermore, I was assigned a twin bed room even when I booked a king bed room. This was on top of the fact that they still had king bed rooms available. I went to my room after receiving my keys only to realise that it was a twin bed room. Went back down to the reception to ask why this was the case and it turns out that they were trying to push out the twin rooms first even though there were still king bed rooms available.

They had placed a sign but it was facing outside not inside for the guests trying to get out. The lower floor exit was the only one open.

"Nice rooms. Shame about the racism, rudeness, hostility, indifference and violent behaviour.",4,"I came to the Pan Pacific 3 days after being in a car accident which took the life of a close relative. I suffered serious trauma to my face and head. I was  in Singapore to get medical clearance from a brain trauma expert to fly to my relative's funeral in Canada.
The early morning (6am) reception staff were OUTSTANDING . They allowed me to check in early and found me a room to allow me to be comfortable.","The staff at the lobby bar were not so good. Even though I had given my room number, and had left my laptop at the table, a (korean) staff member ran after me when I tried to go to the restroom. She accused me of trying to leave without paying , even though I was headed away from the exit . I don't know if it was my ethnicity (Indian) or the fact that I loooked like I had lost a boxing match, it was clear that she was only motivated my appearance. The aggressiveness of her behaviour suggested that she had been trained to behave in this manner towards people who looked like me.
Upon checkout,I once again experienced this contemptuous hostility with the lady at the reception. She kept cutting me off and raising her tone in a very dismissive manner. When She was tagging my baggage which I wanted to leave in storage for a few hours, she handed me my ticket. I waited to ensure that she put the other half of the ticket in my suitcase (I was going to take 3 flights in the next day and a half and did not want to risk any slip-ups with my left luggage). She stared at me pointedly with an expression of  irritation and literally ""shoo'ed"" me waving the back of my hand like one might do to an animal or a beggar on the street. Again this seemed to be normal behaviour to her, at least towards people who looked like me.
Finally when I came to pick up my bag, the porter said he could not find it and that I was not allowed to go inside to identify my bag. When I asked him what he proposed to about it he just shrugged.  When I entered the forbidden zone and pointed out my bags he slammed them into the taxi boot so violently and angrily that the driver came out to see if there was damage to the car!!
It's clear that at the Pan Pacific one is given treatment based one's appearance. If your can elicit pity or favourable racial/socio-economic bias, you will be treated kindly & respectfully.",Sandip,Solo traveler,Deluxe King or Twin Room,1,"9, 2020",Singapore,sg,[List]

We will not go there anymore,7,Location. Facilities are very good.,"We booked the hotel in March for a 5-day stay 10 months later. We were asked to provide arrival times at the airport, what we did. We then arrived at 9pm, as announced and had to learn that our room was not ready yet!!!!!!! We then were informed that they found a room which was ready. It was room #3209, the last room in a row, directly next to the staff/service elevator and staff facilities of that floor and therefore noisy. In addition, the room is probably the smallest of all rooms on the floor (ca. 1.5m shorter versus the other rooms on the floor...). Therefore, the bathroom was small for two people. In addition, the aircondition could not be turned down to acceptable blowing levels. We had to turn it off a lot to ""survive"" in the room.

I had gave my suggestions to them separately and it would be wonderful if Pan Pacific hotel could create and enhance their customers experience instead. Also, excellent service is now expected every where, so it is about time that hotels should level up their games (in competitions). 
- check-in at 3pm and there was long queues at both registration counters 
- Customer Service Eric was there to help ushering the guests to the next available counter. He should ask the guest in the queue instead if they need help in any ways. This is because I was in the queue alone while the rest of my family members were seating at the couch. After 10-15mins, I had to approach Eric for a priority queue cos I have an elderly pax and require a wheelchair (70 years old). He acknowledged and usher me to the next available counter.

Following check-in, we were desperate to shower because we had been in transit for 24 hours. We unpacked, showered and changed, then
checked for some milk to make a coffee. After finding a half drunk iced tea in the fridge, we called guest services to find out whether our
room had been cleaned. They sent a staff member up who scoffed at throwing the half drunk item away. We could have thrown it away
ourselves but we wanted to know that the room had been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival. This isn’t a cheap hotel and cleanliness
should go without saying. They said it had been cleaned and I think it had been done, just not thoroughly because I also found part of a
painted toe-nail on the floor of the toilet area.
Room service was ordered at 9pm and didn’t arrive until 10pm - the chicken wings were warm and the chips (‘truffle fries’) were cold.
Not to mention, the fries were $18! Truly, that’s extortion! There were only enough chips to cover around one large potato with finely grated
Parmesan cheese over the top! We called to advise about the cold chips and the hotel did offer to bring a replacement but we were very
hungry and didn’t want to wait another hour. The hotel did remove the charge off our account which was appreciated but if the service staff
cared to do so, they could easily check the status of the food before delivery to the guest - it was easy to tell the chips were cold because
the plate was cold to touch.
After check out, we wanted to sit in one of the pods to wait for our taxi, but we were given clear instructions that we would have to move
away from the pod if they needed it for another party. To be clear, the pod wasn’t reserved, it’s just that we (a couple) weren’t going to be
ordering a lot of drinks so would have to move out if a bigger party came along (this particular pod had four individual chairs and a table).",Debbie,Couple,Deluxe King or Twin Room,3,"30, 2022",Australia,au,[List]

Great Hotel with great location but very disappointing Club experience,4,"We have been staying at the PanPacific for many years. It has always been our hotel of choice. We returned after the couple of years od covid lockdown expecting the hotel to be the same as the pre-covid days. The hotel itself is the same and the Club suites are just as they used to be. The location of the hotel is still superb. The staff at the Club lounge (eg Shine, Macluther are still there and doing a wonderful job as they always have. A lovely group of professional and attendtive staff - who have become friends over the years). We stayed for 2 weeks. But the experience was very disappointing. The new management of the Hotel really does need to lift its game in the benefits it provides to guests paying for Club access, otherwise guests will find an alternative hotel that proves them with what they expext from a 5 star hotel.","If you stay here for a day or 2 in a Club room it may be OK. But if you stay for 2 weeks then it is definitely a disappointing and underwhelming experience - unlike the pre-covid days. Managment really does need to sit up and pay attention to the expectations of guests who pay tens of thousands of dollars to stay in a Club suite and expect better than what they are currently getting. The problem is that no longer can you go to the Club and have a relaxed breakfast away from the hustle and bustle and screaming kids on the third floor. Then when you go to the Club for afternoon tea, the food never changes  - it is essentially the same every day. Doesn't take long to tire of it if you are there for an extended period. The same goes for evening canapes. Each night was essentially the same - a platter with the same food - some cherry tomatoes, some grapes, couple of pieces of cheap cheese and crackers, some olives, the same small pieces of cake and some fried chicken (sometimes alternated with some other hot dish) but essentially the same every night. And you can't choose your own food but have to take what is given = even if it is not what you want. This is so different to the pre-covid days when dishes changed daily - there was always a wonderful selection of cheese, fruits, bread, hot dishes and desserts. As it stands it is really not worth the cost of paying for Club priviliges when the food selection is so poor. We thought this may all be due to Covid - until I read a review of someone who stayed at the Intercontinental Robertson Quay at about the same time as we stayed at the Pan Pacific. They wrote: ""We wanted a quiet, relaxing time and to be spoilt in the club. We have not been disappointed. This is our ninth night and every day the afternoon tea has been varied and delicious. The evening canape snacks have also changed nightly and are of a high standard.""

Efficient COVID measurements 
Helpful front line staff 
Free parking coupon","Room is Smaller than expected (booked and paid for 3 adults)
Worn looking
Not so inviting balcony with 2 old chairs and stained coffee table. 
2 single beds almost occupied the entire bedroom. Barely any room to accommodate the Third bed.
Missing amenities for 3 pax. 
Called room service to check.
Room service came while we were out.
Still, there were missing items. Not critical, so didn’t bother to ask again.
The toilet bowl was stained. 
Bathroom rug was thin. 
Hand, face and bath towels - doesn’t feel luxurious and fluffy soft. But clean, coz it smelled of Chlorine.  
Not a space to enjoy a shower for sure.
Bathroom amenities could pass for 3 or maybe reluctantly a 4-star hotel. Felt utterly sad for a Pan Pacific.
The hair dryer- powerful if matched w the noise level when used. Almost deafening. 
A very good breakfast??
I couldn’t have imagined anything worse.
Asked for hot milk. Not available.
Only serve apple/orange juice, tea/coffee.
Very limited choice of breakfast sets.
Not tasty at all.
I’m speechless. A 5-star hotel Breakfast, seriously?
Apart from the good points mentioned.

"The hotel was good, but the same services you may get in a cheaper hotel too.",7,"We were a group of three people who came for tourism in Singapore in mid-May. The hotel was great, the staff was also accommodating. They were readily available whenever we needed them. They were also able to provide us with a room 2 hours prior to the check-in time.  The hotel was nicely maintained and beautiful, there were top Singapore attractions within walking distance from the hotel. The beds were comfy and we had a good night's sleep.","We did not find a bidet in the toilet written in the facilities during the booking. We also asked that we will have a single large bed and won't be needing another bed. But, hotel policy added that extra bed by default which we had to pay extra for. In my opinion, this should be optional and only be given to. the customers who explicitly request it. An extra bed was accommodated in a room for two guests so it became cluttered and became uncomfortable. Also, the toiletries, towels, slippers, coffee, tea, etc. all were provided two in number every day and we had to call for extra stuff every day. This could have been done automatically given that the staff knows that three people are staying in the room (3 beds are there in the room). By these standards, we felt that the hotel was pricey. Otherwise, the hotel was good.",Krati,Family,Deluxe Double or Twin Room with Balcony,4,"18, 2022",India,in,[List]
Enjoyable for Children,7,The kids playroom and pool were very nice and my daughter enjoyed them. I also liked that my room had a sofabed and there was a door separating the living room from the bedroom for privacy.,You couldn't have tea service delivered to the room. I paid for the clubroom access but I didn't know kids would not be allowed after 6pm. I was traveling with my 3yr old daughter and I had to take turns with my helper to eat while she watched my daughter. The clubroom manager also saved my helper's leftovers until I arrived and would not replenish the items my helper ate because he said it was supposed to be a shared plate and he didn't want to waste the food she left. This was very surprising since there were other people that were leaving food on the plate which was wasteful. This was very cheap and tacky and in poor taste not to replenish my plate - knowing I had a daughter I could not bring into the club and was taking turns eating with my helper.,Ana,Family,City Suite,1,"17, 2022",Hong Kong,hk,[List]

Also at breakfast the staff kept wanting to clear our plates a few times when we are not done with it.  No staff at breakfast entrance at around 8.45am have to wait for about 7mins. We initially booked a connecting room for twin beds but room not ready when we checking in at ard 3.05pm .

Whereas this used to be a typical business hotel, it seems to be more of a family hotel now, with the pool full of kids over the weekend.","The hotel was apparently suffering from lack of staff after re-opening after Covid lockdown. Room was not cleaned on daily basis, only towels replaced. That is not the service you expect to receive in a 5-star hotel.

They also called me incessantly to put more $$ on the credit card deposit as our incidentals had gone above the limit - the first time this has ever happened during a hotel stay personally.

Upon checking in, we did not receive anything and I clarified with the same crew who sent me that email.

Stayed in a Harbour View Studio on the 32nd level which was a beautifully appointed room, spacious in size, had a great bath and views of the Marina Bay harbour. Good choice of breakfasts & coffee from the Marketplace and the bar in the Atrium is a great place to have a drink at the end of the day.

TV was placed well, good size and efficient.  The power points in the room were also considerately placed.  On service quality, we did not wait long to be checked in.  We felt very welcome as someone came to usher us to an available counter.  Information was provided and our request was attended to very quickly.  I see the consistency in service quality from the management staff to housekeeping and to those in the front line.  The ambience in Pan Pacific Singapore is very drawing.  The lobby itself has very generous space to chill.  Feels like a home really.  The fact that every corner presents a place to chill or consume something is pretty exceptional.  I will definitely return.",I think the hotel needs to update its carpet and perhaps a the cupboards in the room.  There’s an aging smell on the floors.

On the first morning I didn’t know this so had a cold shower. It wasn’t improved despite two engineer visits.
