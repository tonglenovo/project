MOST UNPLEASANT STAYCATION TO-DATE!,TiguanT,"I am writing this review to share with the TripAdvisor community.  HFC staycation was the most unpleasant to-date.  We staycay every month.   I have written in to request for early check-in but was told to call on the actual day to check.  I called up during lunch and was told that the room was not ready and the standard check-in time is 3pm.   I got a call slightly before 2pm while I was driving.  The lady (I didn't get her name but she had an Indian accent) informed me that my room was ready and further added that the flowers have arrived and will be placed in the room!  My partner who was in the car with me was beyond shock and anger.  It was meant to be a surprise for me.  There was a note on the bouquet.  He has also corresponded with the hotel prior without my knowledge.  Our mood was completely ruined.   Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Dayan who was most apologetic about the incident.  During check-in, I asked for late check out but was told that the hotel was full and would only allow late check out at 12.30pm on 10/9.  When we got into the room, the flowers were not there.  We again had to call the front desk.  Dayan brought along a bottle of wine and two plushies (from the hotel) and the flowers that my partner ordered.  He also allowed us late check-out at 2pm.   The next morning, we had breakfast at The Salon.  We were in disbelief and were seriously wondering if HFC is a 5 stars hotel?  The place and breakfast need a MAJOR revamp.  One would never expect such spread at a 5 stars hotel.  That was 3 stars at best or even 2 stars standard.   Hotel breakfast is always a highlight for us but this was terrible.  We barely ate and left. Bear in mind that the room with breakfast comes at a premium!  Upon departure, we were also given a tiny piece of birthday (banana) cake, approximately 3x8cm in size to take away which room service did not manage to leave in the room (we did not have DND turned on) on 9/9.    The hotel can certainly do better with the cake.   As shared by other reviewers, the property is tired and ill-maintained.  Take this as a kind warning, book at your risks!…",1
Fantastic service and vegan food for event,Zeng,"Our group engaged with Hotel Fort Canning for a 4-day event and used their rooms (i.e. Jasmine Room, Living Room and Glass House) for our seminars. We had an amazing experience, including a vegan BBQ and buffet at their Garden Terrace for 60 pax.   We were very impressed with the professionalism and hospitality of the staff, especially Eva. She helped us with a lot of our requests from weeks before our event and delivered professionally in how we want the set ups to be organised. She followed up really attentively with us before, during and after the event.   Something that was very important to us was having vegan food. It seems that this is not what the hotel usually do but their Chef Louis was able to design the menu for our lunches, snacks and dinners with delicious plant-based cuisines. Our group's participants had praised the quality and taste of the food a lot throughout the days there.   Besides the staff, the location and venue were great. The rooms that we booked are conducive for seminars and workshops. There are full-length windows in all the rooms that we used and it was great to have natural light throughout the day (or we could also draw up the curtains). The team were able to quickly change up the set ups of the rooms and partition them quickly, according to our needs. The venue is really central and by situated right in the park, we could go out for a walk very quickly and catch fresh air. One thing that we'd prefer is to have the room to be less cold as the a/c was quite strong. But the staff managed to adjust for us upon feedback.   We are grateful for the attentiveness, hospitality and warmth of the HFC staff team. They made our event such a memorable one for the attendees from 10+ countries over the 4 days. We highly recommend HFC if you're looking at organising seminars or a team retreat.…",5
It could be fabulous - but it wasn’t,MaudWel,"At first impression the hotel, and especially it’s facade and location, have all the ingredients to be a top hotel. But it is tired, the staff is just not interested, the food is terrible.  On arrival at 19:00 no doorman to pick up the luggage. Only one person at reception. No flexibility, no warm welcome. From this type of hotel you would expect a welcome drink, some fruits in your room. But maybe I am just spoilt after living in Asia for 10 years.  The room: good size room, nice bathroom. No supplies in mini bar. No option to control aircon in the room, just one cold centrally arranged temperature. The food; this was the biggest let-down. The coffee at breakfast is very poor and slow from a machine. No fresh coffee or cappuccino, no fresh juice. There is not even normal yoghurt at breakfast, let alone Greek yoghurt, or nuts. No healthy options, fruit limited. This is not Singapore 2022. Choices were limited to basic carbs/ high sugar options or rice and Chinese porridge and local sweets and stale croissants. The bar closes at 10:30pm, doesn’t even have a Coke Zero or coke light. Food at the lobby restaurant is that of a basic sports bar with pizza Hawaii and fries.  Check out took 25 minutes with again only one lady at reception. Luggage collection from the room another 20 minutes…  The doorman during the day is the highlight. A very friendly man!  The gym is fantastic! All equipment you want. The location is lovely if you want to be close to town but in the surrounding of nature.   Overall - they can fix this. Easily. The tools are there, but staff, service and food really need a big boost.…",3
3 day Merdeka Stay in a hidden gem,cK Ong,"Took some time off for Malaysia's merdeka mid-week holiday and drove to Singapore and stayed at HFC. Getting from Tuas Checkpoint to the property was easy and smooth. Parking was free in the property for guests.  The lobby was well appointed and had a very laidback feel. Like a resort hotel vibe despite it being right in the middle of the City.   The room was well appointed, very clean and spacious with all the amenities. Loved the complementary nespresso coffee machine and TWG tea bags in the room.  The bathroom had a shower stall and a separate bath tub, which was well used. Had a good long soak every night after a long day of sightseeing Singapore.  Breakfast was buffet style, but the star for both breakfast days were the fruit platter. Watermelon, rock melon, dragon fruit ...all were exceptionally fresh and crazy sweet.   Connectivity was easy due to its central location. Walking to Dhoby Ghaut is less than 5 mins, and the Downtown Fort Canning station is equally near.   All in all, this is one of the hidden gems for a short staycation in Singapore, quite unlike the usual glass and concrete standard hotels in Singapore. Will come back again.…",5
Dayan Saves The Day,Sarah S,"We experienced a rocky start to our stay at Hotel Fort Canning when our room safe stopped working with our valuables inside it.   Thanks to Dayan at front reception our trip significantly improved when he was able to offer us a free room upgrade. Dayan went the extra mile, showed care and was attentive to greeting us and helping us each time he saw us. He deserves to be commended. His service was excellent.   Before booking at Hotel Fort Canning, be mindful that you will need to walk 5 steep flights of stairs coming / going from the hotel given its situated as a fort.",3
Lovely location.,Alan_Irene,"We really enjoyed the location of this property.  Located in the gardens means no traffic noise and it is only a 10 minute walk to lots of good restaurants and the waterfront.  The hotel itself is tired.  Many of the staff seemed to either lack interest or ability to offer good service.  Most were friendly, some not so much - but we felt the service at this hotel really lets it down.  I cannot emphasise this enough.  From check in to bar service!  For the price they charge the hotel should be cleaner, friendlier and generally offer better service. The only standout was Jonathon, who always greeted us with a smile and friendly, attentive service - the hotel needs another 10 Jonathon’s. The room was spacious and comfortable.",3
Worst suite experience in my life,Chris,"I rarely write reviews, but this time i am really inclined to let people know how awful this hotel is. I booked their suite for my wedding weekend.  1. No one greeted us at the entrance, we didn’t even know where to go. Upon reaching the front desk, the staff was unwelcoming and uninformative. We did not even know how to get to the lift.  2. When we reached suite 220, we noticed that the room was in extremely poor condition. Here are some examples: a. Floor was badly scratched up and looks like it wasn’t clean at all (image 1 & 2) b. There was a baby lizard on the dressing table (image 3)  3. The wooden floor at the dining area was in very poor condition. One of us suffered a wooden splinter in their foot. (No image because it was a tiny piece that couldn’t be captured on camera)  4. We requested for a 3rd bed in the suite, so we went to the concierge, and there was no staff around, I had to call out to the back to get someone’s attention. The staff again was unwelcoming and unhelpful, responding to us “ya, it will be extra 80 dollars”, without also specifying that it is the price for one night.  5. That night, when we called for extra pillows and water, we called the operator but no one picked up (is that normal?), we called housekeeping and the staff told us ‘we had no more pillows’. He did not spend any effort making pleasantries on the phone either, he literally told me “ok. Bye.” – which honestly is appalling service. When he came up, he said he found extra pillows, but he was carrying them with his bare hands and chin, and balancing the waterbottles above the pillows. I have no issue with that, but shouldn’t there be some level of hygiene here?  6. The next morning, the makeup artist arrived at around 745am to prep my wife for wedding makeup. Upon arrival, the reception was ASLEEP at the front desk. Is this acceptable?  7. Upon calling for water, we were told that we reached the limit for getting water for our room. Again, if that is your policy, that is fine. But I have never in my life been capped on plain water from a hotel, and I am staying in a suite nonetheless.  8. One of our bridesmaids used the bathroom in the dining area got TRAPPED in the toilet from the inside – even without locking the door. The door just jammed and we could not get it open. (I will not post the video for the privacy reasons)  9. Upon checking out, no one helped with our bags, no one bothered to ask if we needed parking coupons or a cab? I have stayed in hotels rated much poorer that pays attention to such details. We just lugged everything ourselves to end off the bad experience.  Please save yourself the horror and just book another hotel.…",1
Always a lovely stay!!,Amanda K,"Absolutely love HFC, stayed here 4 times in last 7 years. This time it’s looking a bit tired but as usual the staff are lovely and always willing to help. The pools are stunning and it’s a lovely little quiet stay in the middle of a huge city. Singapores National Day is 9th Aug and they celebrate with all sorts of events, concerts and fan fair. Try to make your stay here with this included.",4
Great stay!,Seri Lee,"Albeit all the other not so great reviews of the hotel, ours was great!   Room was great and spacious and the bathroom was a gem! Tho the front office staff could be a little more friendly and welcoming, the room was perfect. After reading the reviews of the hotel, I wasn’t too sure if it will be great to celebrate my husband’s birthday there. However upon arrival at 5pm, the check in was smooth.   We were assigned room 339 which was nice and I guess the hotel decided to maintained their rooms after all the reviews they received recently.   We were promised a cake for my husband’s birthday but we received none. I didn’t mind it at all since we had a cake of our own brought by our friends. However it’ll be great if the promise was delivered.  Will return here again for the nice rooms and peaceful ambiance!…",4
Poorly Maintained Infrastructure and Limited Amenities,Vincentimbe C,"Had a short 2-night staycation with friends. Other than the friendly staff at the front desk, housekeeper and server from the kitchen, there is nothing much to compliment the hotel. The receptionist processing the check-in was friendly and patient in explaining the details to me. As we had turned on do-not-disturb sign, we were not approached by the housekeeper. However, when I bumped into him along the corridor to ask for new towels, he was helpful to exchange towels for me and proactively asked if we needed to change the bed linens, which we kindly declined. On the second night, I had called the kitchen to request for a bottle opener, and the staff was prompt to deliver to our door.  The front desk staff told us it was a non-smoking room, but we could smell a strong stench of lit cigarette along the corridor leading to our room. The room is spacious as advertised but the in-room amenities are pretty limited. The Smart TV could not be linked up to our personal laptops via HDMI. There is a big bathtub and separate shower, which we appreciated. The wooden floor and table looked poorly maintained. The shower head and the air conditioning vent were mouldy. There were lots of dust gathering at tight corners, such as behind the TV and behind the bedside table.  The worst of all was another guest was able to opened our room door using his access card key to our horror. When we rang up the front desk, the staff told us that the guest was facing issue opening his room door, which was located just one floor below us, and the guest was trying to open other doors. The guest also forgot his own room number, and mistook ours as his. The staff apologised over the phone to us. She explained the hotel was investigating into the incident, but was unable to provide an explanation as to what could have happened. Perhaps the hotel should review the room access card key system.…",2
Beautiful Heritage hotel ,evie,"Fast check in and overall good service. The house keeping staff was attentive, despite high traffic in the June holidays, he was all smiles and try to be of assistance. They have 2 adult pools which is great for a 5 star hotel but needed some touch up on the panting of the walls, as they look dated.",4
Over priced stayacation,Soon C,"totally disappointed for a 5 star hotel. Had our girls staycation on May 28th to 30th. the outlook of the hotel maybe off which we didn't mind. The signage to the SPA was not easily located even there is signage, what got us angry was that we follow the signage and even asked the staff, all gave us the wrong direction until when i called the SPA, we manage to find. took as at least 40 minutes to locate. And there was no proper signage to locate the POOL and worst is location to get the beach towel, you have to walked to the other building to take the lift to level 1 - their so call Executive club (does not even look like a Club Room).imagine you have to walk back to drop the wet towel later.  their interior is dam dark, especially when you have to take the steps to your room,…",2
Fully satisfied stay after two and half years!,keng g,My first visit after the Pandemic locked down.  Dared not expect much as the pandemic had turn the world upside down! To my surprise HFC actually remained as good as pre-pandemic. My room was clean and all the facilities in the room were in excellent conditions! Front desk was polite and efficient! Took me 5 minutes to check-in. My favorite breakfast at the Salon was as satisfactory as before. After the nice morning walk around the hill i had a light meal at the Salon again. it was good! Overall my stay at HFC was excellent and satisfying! Will be going back soon since no ATK / PCR tests are required!,5
Stay at hotel was really good,starforce1201,"The hotel was really nice to stay in. Room was comfortable and well maintained, breakfast was really good and the scenery surrounding the hotel make this place worth staying in. I recommend this hotel to anyone who want to wake up to a beautiful scenery",4
Avoid Hotel Fort Canning (May 2022),ZAHN629,"26 to 27 May 2022: Our stay cost $350++ and was by far the worst staycay experience. We were early because we were informed by the Hotel sales rep that we can try to check if early check-in was possible. Instead, we were treated like uninvited guests when the female Manager met us at the lobby. She was so concerned about her food delivery and ignored us. She came back and asked us if we wanted to check-out without a proper welcome. She told us that no rooms were available hastily and did not appeared genuine nor sincere. We were fine with the unfriendly welcome and simply checked in our luggage.  The bed was stained with red and brown spots. Attached was the photo on the surface. I did not take picture of the mattress cover because the 2 male housekeepers were fast to remove it.…",1
"serene, comforting and the perfect getaway from the city",Hannah G,"The hotel is well maintained, rooms are spacious and luxurious. I checked in for some time away from the usual city bustle and was not disappointed.   The toilet view extends into greenery and a lot of peace. The room is filled with the best amenities, a gorgeous bath tub, beautiful couch that acted as a reading nook for me and a plush bed. I slept and woke naturally - the best feeling in the world.   Because I wanted to stay in, I indulged in ordering room service and I'm so glad to say that I was not disappointed. Chicken rice was delicious and the chocolate lava cake was very indulgent; perfect for my vacay mood.   The massage parlour found within the compound was a great experience as well - only thing to note is that it is a tad difficult to locate, so just make sure you…",5
Great 2 nights stay!,Stefen Png,Great helpful staff and spent a wonderful 2 days here.  Shana was a great help and appeared genuine when speaking to guests.   Dayan was very helpful and patient too: we kept returning with more and more luggages lol.  Thank you for the wonderful stay!,5
"Mouldy and poorly maintained, felt like a chalet",Connie,"Booked the deluxe garden room.   Very poorly maintained, overall stay feels more like a rundown chalet than a 5 star hotel. I back up everything I say below with pictures where possible.   Due to the open concept bathtub and poor ventilation, there was mould in many corners - beneath the glass doors, on the curtain, on the ceiling. FYI, mould produces allergens, irritants and, sometimes, toxic substances. Inhaling or touching mould spores may cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and skin rash. Please go and google how mould can be harmful.  The shower area and toilet bowl area are separate areas that are side by side. To save space, the door of the shower and toilet bowl area is a sliding one, BUT YOU CAN ONLY CHOOSE TO CLOSE ONE OF IT. Best thing…",1
"Much better 4/5-star hotels options than this, avoid if you can.",Jing,"An overall disappointing stay, will not be back and will highly recommend against staying here. Mostly let down by the service and (lack of) attention from the staff; based on other reviews here, this seems to be consistently brought up, something the management ought to look into.  1.	Asked for gym and pool opening hours during check-in and was met with a disgruntled look from front desk lady where she had to ask her colleagues for the info (surely a FOH staff would know the answer to this what I presume is a basic question?). This was followed up with an audible sigh where we asked another question to clarify. Great start to our stay with such hospitality.  2.	Called front desk to report about the faulty mini fridge in our room and requested for their assistance, staff who…",1
Compliment,Nina Ashlynx,"We would like to compliment a staff, Nash, on his wonderful service and for recommending great places to go to throughout our stay at the hotel. Breakfast at The Salon was also wholesome thanks to a very friendly, cute and bubbly waiter, who seemed to be in his 50s. He knew when to make small talk and it was nice. Unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to ask for his name. Even the housekeepers were polite and housekeeping was done efficiently. The room was always clean and grooming kits/water bottles/toiletries were always stocked. Really enjoyed our stay there. Keep up the excellent work!",5
Not a 5 star Hotel so manage your expectations,Jacmac85,"It's such a shame because it could be such a great experience staying at this hotel, but it's let down by lots of different things. First of all, the service is apalling - the receptionist was on her phone for half of my checking in. Food was left outside my room for 24 HOURS, which in Singapore with insects and heat is really quite gross. I asked for it to be cleared a number of times and no one came. It was impossible to get someone to pick up the phone for in room diing and I had to go down to reception. Also, I read that the service was bad but I was going with work so I kind of thought it wouldn't be a big deal - but even then with low expectations I really felt like I wasn't welcome at all.  The rooms are fine, but a little run down so please keep this in mind when you…",2
Adventurous Hotel Stay,Caris_Minky Lee,HFC is a different “feel” for hotel stay. You need to have strong legs for the staircases which you have to climb up down daily. Plus you must love Nature and not be afraid of mosquitoes bite. Enjoyed the Therapeutic Greenery surrounding. This hotel building was the former British Far East Command  HQ during WWII.  It was beautifully restored.  Those who love history may find it exciting to stay here! To Pay SGD20 per person to visit the bunker of BattlEBox was abit costly.    Hotel allowed early check-in for us at 1pm (Thanks!) Room was clean and bath tub cleaner than my home’s tub!   I am glad to survive 3D2N stay at HFC which mean I m physically still VERY Fit! What a Adventurous stay! Thank God & enjoyed another wonderful Birthday Staycation!,4
Think twice before you book the room,Nicholas C,"We didnt read any reviews when we book a room in Fort canning hotel. Upon arrival we saw the front desk agent chatting and we told them we are looking for checking in, one of the lady answer us inpatiently ""its here"". We ask the front desk lady few questions about the stay she answer us unprofessionally and sarcastically, I believe she is the front office manager or duty manager kind of position, if as a manager position you treat the customers poorly i dont think it will set a good example for the rest.  The hotel property is beautiful and historical but the inner property lacks of  love and attention, the pool is dirty , the walls are stains, even our bed after we lay on it causes an itch.  But we would like to say thank you to a lady Name Ruby from the Salon, she is the most…",1
One of the most disappointing hotels,Woo,"From the moment I stepped into the hotel, my partner and I both felt that we're not welcomed at all. When we walked in and approached to the staff, one of them was looking at the phone and didn't even greet, and both staff were not friendly at all unlike other 4 or 5 star hotels. Very poor service. Plus, the check in was delayed, for more than 30 minutes - this is not because of the long queue or any covid protocols, but it was because the room was not READY. Still can't believe this could be happened at the 5 starts hotel.   Amenities were very poor as well - you may want to bring your own body wash, shampoo and conditioner. Didn't even have a robe. When we called the front desk to get us a robe, the call was not even picked up twice.  The room was not clean. There were several…",2
Very poor service and follow up provided by the Front Office staff,Krish,"Stay was ok. I found a used underwear and a shirt in one of the drawers and I was very disgusted about it. It is a pandemic period and it shows that room was not cleaned properly and they don’t take these things seriously.  I reported it to a Chinese guy at the front office around 2300++ on 25th of March and showed him a picture of it. he seemed unbothered and all he told me was, I will send the image to Housekeeping. There was no apology extended by him nor anything was done. It was too late and told them to clear it the next morning instead.   I think the owners should really re-train this people or at least hire someone with experience to handle such situations! It reflects really badly on the property. We are paying so much, yet, very underwhelming service being provided.  I…",2
Great hotel with bad customer service,Jun,"I had my stay with the hotel on from 5th to 6th March. We were excited for my partner's birthday & anniversary celebration. There was a male attendant/receptionist at the lobby on 5th afternoon who was impolite & not helpful. There were problems in our room, I called and he hung up on me as soon as I told him about the issue, I called back immediately and there was no answer, so my fiancée had to walk down to the lobby to check, she was then told to go back and wait in the room without further instructions. I called again after we waited for 15 minutes, and the male receptionist hung up on me again!! So I walked to the lobby to check and luckily there was a nice female receptionist who helped. I appreciated that we were then transferred to an upgraded room, although the room was…",3
Great stay for couples,kyaul,"Had a fast and smooth check. We chose the city view and we definitely love the huge bathtub, bidet and hot shower. There wasnt a lot of people during our stay so we definitely enjoyed the peaceful pool time all to ourselves. Breakfast was great as well  We are satisfied with out stay here and would come back another time",5
Excellent Customer Service Provided!,Eyra,"We checked-in on Saturday afternoon, 26th February 2022 and checked out on 28th Feb 2022. We were pleasantly greeted and attended by Mr. Tommy Liew whom despite had to delay his lunch break due to many check-ins on that day, still put us guest as his priority. It was my husband and mine 1st time there as a newly wed couple and Mr. Tommy gave us his assurance on the view and amenities of the hotel that we got. Overall, we had a great time there and we love everything about the hotel. We will definitely check-in again at HFC! Thank you for the pleasant experience.",5
Average Stay,khrlhmd,"Room size is average. AC control not working properly. Limited TV channels, some channels had sound but no image and some channels had image without sound. Water flow in the bathroom was bad. Rain shower was badly designed.  The only good part was the spacious bathroom and the big size bathtub. Bidet is also available.",3
Underwhelming,Dr Mark,"Hmm.   Maybe I was just unlucky, but my experience was that HFC fell short of the mark at every turn.  There was only one front desk staff member on duty at peak check-in time and I had to wait my turn.  When I finally got to the desk, the procedure was much more complicated than at any other place I stayed at on my recent trip to Singapore.  The process took forever, and the front desk officer took calls three times while he was dealing with me.  The air-conditioning in the first room they put me in was stuck on heat mode and you could have baked a cake in there (Some how the room set up staff hadn’t noticed). Repair was not possible in the short term.  The alternative they offered me was an upgrade, but the shower didn’t work. The knob came off in my hand.  There was always…",3
"Slow check-in, rude ohone operator.",Lucas L,"Cons: - Waited 1.5 hours to check-in. Check in time was at 3pm. We reached at 3.30pm but had to waited till 5pm to check-in. - Phone operator hung up on me - Room service food was below average. Nasi goreng tasted like chinese fried rice. Pizza bread was soft. - Pool area looked a bit run down   Pros - They gave us free drinks while waiting for the check-in. - They gave us a late check out at 12.30pm (instead of 12nn), they pushed it to 1pm after I requested for more time. - Gym was big - They allowed me to leave my car at the drop-off point",2
Will come back again!,Yeung CH,"Clean and rooms are well decorated. Rooms are great for couples! Good service!  Planned for my proposal, got a complimentary upgrade and early check in. Front task manager was welcoming, approachable and relatable. Check in area was comfortable and processes was quick.",5
The best hotel in Singapore!,Alan Ngo,Its one of the best hotel in Singapore that I had stayed before. Love the whole concept of the room where the bathtub is just beside it. Its a last minute for changing the date to earlier but the hotel manage to did it! Appreciate it! Staffs is all friends and hopeful too!!! 5 stars for them!,5
Not really a 5 star hotel,stily,"I was expecting to give a rating of at least 4 out of 5, but I was more disappointed than delighted with our stay.  The good:  - Lovely direct view of the greenery. Be sure to lower the blinds before using the bathroom. - Large, deep bathtub. - Big, clean and very classy looking bathroom. - Free sheltered parking.  The bad:  - The room itself was tiny with hardly any walking space. Only the bathroom was big. - Doors were not soft close and we could hear everyone’s doors slamming. - The chair was peeling and worn. So were the other accessories in the room. - Keycard slot cover (like a socket cover) came out. - Memo in the room said to WhatsApp/text the number for any questions, yet there was no answer throughout our stay. - Room hardly had any sockets. We had to unplug the coffee…",3
Below Our Expectations,JP,"We booked a room as we thought its really near the ROM as we had our wedding solemnization and was also hyped by their unique bathroom setting on the ads.  The hotel was supposedly a 5 Star Luxury class but as per our experience its merely a 2 or 3 star service.  Hallways cleanliness badly needs improvement.  The room cleanliness also bad. I had to call housekeeping when I found headboard full of dust and dusty utensils in the wardrobe cabinet.  Was expecting them to offer us other room but they only send housekeeping.  We also had an add on ""semi-buffet"" breakfast, but we were also disappointed with their service. They're menu doesn't offer much for its price.  If you are planning to booked it like we planned because of ROM you might need to reconsider. It's a hike going in and…",2
Stay at hotel fort canning,Nah2811,"We stayed in the deluxe King room. It was beautiful especially the toilet. Very clean and spacious. Room service was great. Food at the hotel was not very nice. We only had breakfast on the first day and skipped next day's breakfast as there were not many choices. We had the in room dining Indonesian fried rice. We did not enjoy the food as well. Overall, it was a nice relaxing stay at the hotel, we even had a complimentary birthday cake for my boyfriend's bday.",4
Wedding Anniversary.,Noel,"The location of the hotel was idyllic. It was serene and quiet away from the bustle of the city and close to Nature. The occupancy of the hotel was limited by the number of rooms which is conducive to those seeking a blissful stay. We enjoyed our morning walks with the scent of pandan leaves in the air and the educational walk by the spice gardens. These are sights you don’t see in most hotels. We had our meals in the restaurant and found the nasi lemak extremely tasty , natural or with lobster it was delicious either way. The same goes for the chicken curry, salmon seafood stew and the hot fun. The Happy hour drinks was worth every penny as well.  Considering it is a old hotel, the rooms and toilets were very clean and well maintained, in fact , the whole hotel is well…",5
Dirty & unhygienic room,Randy,"We were excited to have my girlfriend’s birthday celebration here. Unfortunately, after spending some time in the room, we found a used mask in the room on the floor. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the room was very dusty. We went down to inform the receptionist and was disappointed that we were not even given a room change. Totally spoilt our first time there.",1
Waiting Game,Rusy H.,"The prepping of room took an hour to get ready. Disappointed that they’re not compensating our time. And it wasn’t ready during check-in, neither did we requested for early check-in. It would be much appreciated if we’re called earlier to say the room wasnt ready before we were physically present for checking in.",1
Excellent location but lacking in some respects,Mark M,"Our room was comfortable and well equipped with kettle, fridge and coffee machine. Furnishings all good quality. Large bathroom and view towards Fort Canning Park. Breakfast was served in a room overlooking a patio but unfortunately this was not available, with COVID it would have made sense to offer guests the opportunity to sit outside. We requested this and we were served as a special favour, we highly recommend ‘Uncle Lee’ the head waiter who was cheerful, helpful and friendly. Breakfast was generous but table service only. Our biggest disappointment was having to access the pool via the underground car park and two lifts.

Nice & Cosy Hotel,Leon L,The hotel is nice & feel cosy. The front desk lady was very friendly and helpful. We felt that the hotel staffs were very nice. The room bed is very comfortable with Nespresso coffee machine. The toilet is very spacious nice bath tub with very nice view. The only negative point is the toilet doesn’t have ventilation. Overall we enjoyed our staycation😊,4
Beautiful architecture but poor service,Eunice T,"We went for a one-night staycation. The hotel grounds are beautiful but the service leaves one very disappointed as this hotel was listed as 5 star luxury on klook. Dinner and breakfast in the restaurant could have been much improved if there were more staff. We had to keep signalling to get attention of wait staff but they were so busy they didn’t see us and other customers. The route to the pool was ridiculous. There were no signs around, and even after asking the hotel staff it was a maze to get to. One had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to a lift in what looked like an abandoned ballroom. Then take the lift down one floor to the Carpark, walk into the Carpark and then to another entrance, sign in then walk through a corridor to take another lift up to the pool. All…",3
Comments,Emilia,"The hotel was good, it was clean and the staff was actually friendly and also take effort to clarify things. I would like to praise every staff that works over there for all your hardwork 😄  As for the reservation manager,  they actually being patient with me despite me asking things over and over again just so i clarify things correctly.   4 star rate because i was upset that the shampoo and body wash, when i used it,  it became itchy for my partner and i...and i notice that the room isnt very soundproof, i can hear people walking, opening their doors and also from outside can hear what music i play it on their room speaker.",4
Staycation,DeszieJj,It was a tranquil & beautiful oasis in the heart of the city. The rooms were very cozy & the staff were pleasant & accomodating. This made our stay extremely pleasing. Would definitely return for another visit.,5
Not a bad staycay,Hotel reporter,"Booked 1 night song SRV for this place to take a break from work. Check in was smooth and fast. Room was nice - high ceiling, bath tub overlooking the park.  Breakfast was ok. Understaffed (only had 3 staff working). Could only order 1 main meal (doesn't have ala carte buffet).  Overall it was a good stay. Would come back again.",4
Beware the extra charges if you arrive on an early VTL flight,Mike S,"Having booked in March 2021 and requested an early check in due to the early arrival of our flight from the UK(before latestest quarantine rules) I was disappointed to incur an early check in fee equivalent to one nights stay, resulting in our 4 night stay costing 5 nights. Under the current quarantine requirement when arriving in Singapore to stay in your hotel until you receive the result of your ART at Changi this felt like profiteering! That early set back aside we were pleased with our room which was a very good size, well appointed and everything worked well. The park setting is lovely but beware rooms on level 2 at the back means the footpath through the park looks directly into your bedroom and bathroom. Breakfast is a choice of two settings can’t remember exact timings…",3
Great getaway from work!,thesmequation,"Check-in was fast and we directly booked the pool session during check-in. The room is really beautiful with the outdoor bathroom and bathtub that has great view! We enjoyed the Executive Dinner Set at The Salon, it was reasonably priced and the proportions were quite big, really sumptuous meal! :) Overall, this hotel is really comfortable and relaxing for us as we take a short break off from work! :)",5
We stayed here on our honeymoon/my birthday for 5 nights bed & breakfast and it was absolutely brilliant,DavidiL89,"We were here 5 nights (5 Jan 2022) in a deluxe room with a beautiful view of Singapore city, (facing towards Orchard Plaza) we were also here for my birthday too.  We fully recommend the limo service to the hotel and back to the airport too! It’s worth every dollar!   Pool was lovely and refreshing and free wifi everywhere was a nice touch!   The hotel was modernised but still retained Fort Canning’s elegance, it was very clean too.  Our room was made up every single day and tidied too, fresh towels and soaps were also restocked as well as bottles of water.  All the staff were so friendly, approachable and attentive.  A few special mentions for the staff we generally dealt with on a daily basis:  Maggie Chow - we booked our honeymoon nearly two years ago but because of covid-19…",5
BEWARE: My surprise marriage proposal was ruined by Hotel Fort Canning.,Alexander Z,"This was my second stay at HFC.   I had been planning a surprise proposal for my partner so I had been in touch with Maggie from the HFC Reservations Team for weeks talking through options. They had recommended either a picnic in the park, or to assist with some sort of floral setup in the rooms. Each option would cost just under S$200 and it was extremely transactional - they were not willing to entertain any special requests.  The above is honestly fine by me, I was hoping for more flexibility but I don't expect people to go above and beyond. Instead I had just ONE simple request - to keep the picnic a SECRET from my partner.  Lo and behold, the moment I checked in at the front desk, the staff immediately asks me to confirm the picnic arrangements in front of my partner. I had…",1
good and bad,Ahmad88,"Booked a 3d2n on dec 20th to 22nd,as we reached the hotel, we didn’t feel welcome.  we indicated in the remarks that this will be our honeymoon stay. unfortunately, no special arrangements has been made.   the room was good. spacious toilet with bathtub oversee the trees. hotel is quiet and far from the busy roads.  breakfast was ok, no complaints as a lot of restrictions.  the hotel offers two types of pool. there was a couple of monkeys using the pool as well.  the gym was good too with good quality equipments . but i lost my way as the staff was unsure and gave the wrong directions.  the last night of our stay turned out to be disaster. we saw cockroaches crawling around to our room from the room next door and from the toilet as well.   thanks",3
Room is great but service needs to be 200% better,TS,"Booked a 3D2N premium luxe room, which was really spacious (about half the size of a BTO 4rm) and a bathtub that’s larger than many other hotels in Singapore! Truly a comfortable stay, I must say. Would have been good if they had bathrobes, which by now is considered a standard provision at hotels of the similar range.   The pool wasn’t crowded most of the time - it has quite a number of deckchairs and thus great for those looking for a tanning session. The staff members at the club were very, very friendly. Among the different service crew, the two ladies manning the counter were the most cheery and welcoming of the lot!   There were however some disappointing lapses in service, which seem to stem from communication gaps in their workflow. Major few below, seemingly similar to…",3
Great experience at HFC,Syasya,It was an amazing 2 nights stay over at HFC for our honeymoon. Staff was friendly and they even decorated our room. Love the garden view and the bathroom was awesome. We enjoyed our stay there. Thank you HFC!,5
Average Experience,Taufiq,"Hotel stay was an average experience. This is my 2nd time here, the 1st time was in 2016. A lot hasn’t changed since then. Wished there was new interior fittings. TV was old, shower ain’t that great. The room had this weird smell not sure if it was from the wooden furnitures.  But what was definitely great was some of the staff members who were kind enough to acknowledge my wife being pregnant and did the necessary in ensuring my wife’s safety.",3
Good first experience however can be better.,Leong S,"This was I family first experience with Hotel Fort Canning Checking in was quite brief and of the 2 rooms we booked, we managed to check in one about 1pm and the 2nd about 3pm. The colonial style building was quite well maintained and clean. Overall service was satisfactory however when we checked in, we were informed that the breakfast slots for both days only left with the first slot from 7-8:30am while the second slot from 9-10:30am were already fully booked. Unfortunately the pace of them serving food from 7am was very slow and the varieties of choices for breakfast were also limited. They also limit each guest to only have 1 main course. While we understand that due to Safe Management Measure, hotel cannot serve buffet breakfast however they only make this as “semi-buffet…",4
Wedding Anniversary stay,Damien X,"Booked HFC because of the room view and it’s a hotel away from the bustling city.  Splendid night view and serenity environment to relax for a 3D2N stay celebrating our wedding anniversary.  Will like to thank the reservation manager (Maggie ) for entertaining me via emails for all my requests and to take note of our preferences and also Nadia from FO to follow up on all my requests.  However, there are some points which I think can be improved to provide a more superb experience for future stay.  For eg, on our first day, we notice there are used cotton buds left behind by previous guests in the sanitary box placed in toilet. Took picture and show it to FO. The next day before we went out for our brunch we requested for a make up room and specifically mention about the used…",3
Not the best 5 star hotel. Service can be improved.,xxEliciaxx,My hubby and I chose this hotel for honeymoon due to the positive reviews we read previously. We held our wedding on the same day we check into the hotel but was utterly disappointed with the service considering it's a 5-star hotel and the cost of staying for 2 nights doesn't come cheap.   +ve:  - bed is huge and comfortable  - nice bathtub but wasn't very clean when we first entered the room (we kind of wash the tub again before using it) - nice area to chill (premier room) - breakfast was nice but you can only select 1 main dish   -ve: - espresso machine was dusty  - crowded breakfast area at The Salon. Most of the staff looked like students working part time and they were all very young. Seems like there was shortage of manpower as we waited for half an hour for a seat even…,2
Good stay,Ijustpooted,"Stayed for 1 night at 305, room and bathtub was of decent size the service staffs are mostly trainees, but good service attitude still :) The hotel information indicated the front office manager’s WhatsApp number, the replies were prompt - we got a late checkout and additional pool slot!  The down sides were: - checked in slightly late as the room wasn’t ready - the layout was that the door was near the bed (wasn’t soundproof, could hear people walking/closing their doors) - the pool and gym were at another building (best to use the glasshouse’s lift to access) - there were broken tiles in the pool, could tell that it wasn’t well maintained",3
5-star hotel with 3-star experience,Sherry E,"We did enjoy our stay here and really wanted to love this hotel but unfortunately, there are more cons than pros.   Pros:  - Large room with king bed and spacious bathtub that is clean  - Comfortable pillows, clean towels, clean bed  - Swimming pool (at the lower level) is heated and warm  - Express, fuss-free check out available Staff that we spoke to were generally good-natured and friendly   Now for the cons.   Cons:  - Exterior is falling apart and needs some serious repainting. A pity that the water fountains at the entrance and lobby were all drained and switched off (not sure if it’s due to covid = manpower issues??). Without it, the hotel seemed dead  - Bathrobe we requested for has a hole  - Housekeeping did not make up our room despite us requesting for it and being…",3
"Extremely Average, ranging on Disappointing",Clemon Ho,"- Check-in Timing stated for 3pm. I arrived at 3pm, was told that the room was not ready. Was only given a room at 430pm. Had to walk about elsewhere till I received a call that I was finally able to check-in.  - Housekeeping staff was not helpful. Called for assistance on various amenities but no response or did not get back to me. In the end, I had to go down to the concierge and ask for the specific items (Soap & Pillows).  - Breakfast was utterly disappointing. Ordered the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. Eggs were hard and overcooked, you could get a better plate of Eggs Benedict from any random breakfast cafe  - Staff at The Salon (Hotel Restaurant) were all young and inexperienced. Took orders wrongly. Furthermore, when we arrived for breakfast on the 2nd day, the restaurant…",2
Staycation at Hotel Fort Canning,Fredric1964,Check-in was at 3pm. Took about 30 mins to complete all the process.   The room was of a decent size but wasn’t as big as other hotels.

A Cozy Heritage Hotel Staycay....,AnnascNov2021,We had a wonderful staycay! A cozy heritage hotel with friendly and personal service! A unique bathroom indeed with an excellent bathtub! Special mention of Restaurant manager Ruby and Uncle Lee for their special homely touch. A lovely quiet retreat amidst Fort Canning Park in the heart of Singapore. Noted that it can be an excellent outdoor and indoor wedding venue with the pretty lawn and glasshouses.,4
The room is good. Everything else is missing something,Enne,"Check in was quick and painless for me. Room is spacious. Super cold ac and I have to call 4-5 times and have staff came to my room twice to get it finally fixed. Staffs are all nice except the guard. But don't expect 5-star hotel's service. In general the hotel is missing good management and talent. The decoration in lobby is poor tasted. You can see the potential in this beautiful historical building but the level is not there.   Overall I did get a great rest in the hotel room. obsessed with their bathtub. But if you go with the expectation of 5 star hotel, you'd be disappointed.",3
Disastrous ,Chan S,"Called to check-in but told me they cant accommodate due to high occupancy. I do understand that. Went on the day of check-in at 2.50pm. Check-in time should be 3pm and end of the day we checked in around 4.30pm. A 5-star shouldnt have problems with this. Should buckle up their service given to customers. Manpower might be an issue, but for a 5-star hotel checking in at this hour isnt acceptable. Room is okay but isnt as clean as we hoped for. The toilet floor was still wet when we came in. Hope to see more improvements in the future or else i wouldnt even consider to come back here for my second visit. ",2
Disappointing Experience - Poor Management of Check In Service,Joxpy,"Was here on a staycation with friend. Despite the standard check in time at 1500hrs, we waited for more than an hour for the room. The reception informed that the room is not ready with many other guests crowding at the lobby waiting for their rooms. The staff cannot provide a time for the room to be ready and insisted that the housekeeping was at full force. While we understand during the pandemic period, the cleaning will need to be more detailed, this is the first time we have encountered such situation which clearly means the hotel is not fully prepared for such situation during peak period with no early check in or late check out even being offered like some other hotels. There were only 2 reception counters and no one else seen in sight to help to comb the crowd The poor…",2

"Manage your expectations, bad service!",winifredddd,"Read reviews that this hotel is good, but I want to leave a review to caution and manage expectations of those booking their stay here in Hotel Fort Canning. We are not sure if the COVID situation has led to their disappointing/absent customer service and a strain on their manpower, so we are trying to be balanced in our reviews here.   The bad 🙁 - We entered the hotel and no one directed us to their check-in counter (far left from the entrance so you won't get lost like us haha) - Join the long queue at the check-in counter (staff will not acknowledge your presence or apologise for the waiting time as you queue, so manage your expectations here too) - Room is not ready and delayed.

Hotel has to decide if it wants to be 3 stars or 5 stars,Bernard T,"We last visited Fort Canning Hotel in 2017. Service Standards have certainly dropped since then - same goes for the general upkeep of the hotel.   Positives - we were allowed early check in - front desk was accommodating when we asked for a switch in rooms as our air con was making really loud noise  Negatives - service was not great in general. The guy in the front desk didn't really give us much useful info wrt the use of the hotel facilities etc. Also initially insisted that we did not pay for the breakfast package (which we had) - until corrected by his colleague. At the breakfast session, at least 2 waitresses saw us waiting at the entrance and ignored us.

Way past its prime,ryantravels,"First impressions were horrible - Only 1 staff was at the check-in counter (a bespectacled Indian lady), and she was on the phone when I arrived. She didn’t bother acknowledging me, or signalling me to sit down while I was carrying multiple bags. Not that big of an issue there, as she might have been really engrossed with her phone call.   Check-in: I reached at 2:15pm and she told that the room was not ready and that it might take up to 3:30pm. Since this was later than the standard check in time of 3pm, I asked if late check out will be accorded in case of a late check-in; and she replied with a curt no. I asked why not, and she (extremely rudely) said check in time is FROM 3pm so the hotel is not required to give me a late checkout. Extremely appalling that the hotel…",1
Amused if it's a budget or good class hotel,Kentino,"What an experience, 2 nights stay in their Studio Suite, leaving me to ponder if we just stayed in a budget hotel or a good class hotel. Some of the highlights with photos attached:  1. Studio Suite comes with a balcony that sits next to the smoking point, providing you endless amount of fresh 2nd hand smoke of different brands.   2. Are you thirsty? No worries, you get 2 complimentary bottles of water per day. If you need more bottles, you only need to pay a small amount of fee. I wonder if other budget hotels should follow the same strategy to save mineral water from human beings.   3. Hotel provides complimentary toiletries. One tiny bottle each for shampoo, conditioner, and body shower is enough to last you for 3d2n. Again, saving toiletries from human beings. Good thought. …",1

Bathtub was in the room itself, something which I perceived it rather unique. The hotel sits in Fort Canning Park and there are many areas to explore around.  There are also some aspects which requires improvement.   1. The facade of the building and its surrounding amenities needs to be seriously look into. Seems to been forgotten for a long time.   2.

Upon reaching, I was greeted by an indian lady and she invited me to sit in the lobby to wait for the next available staff. She went to everyone politely and asked if they are waiting to be served. I was waiting for less than 5mins and Ivena approached me and asked if I was waiting to check-in. She asked for our IC and went her way to assist us with checking in.

It would be nice too if they could offer bungy services to the nearest drop off point since this hotel is located in the middle of nowhere. Bathroom with a view was the main reason why we booked this hotel.

We had some problems with the lights and housekeeping promptly came to fix. Location is awesome...could explore fort canning in the day and evening which is rare. Its near plaza sing and robertson quay. Overall really enjoyable.,5
Nice getaway from our bustling city.,Aliff Daniel,"Do I recommend this hotel for your next stay? A million percent, yes! If you need a short getaway from your busy life and in need of somewhere that has peace and serenity, this fine hotel is perfect for you. I understand that Sentosa is a tad too far for some to have a getaway from our bustling city, I feel you! Fort Canning is an ideal location yes? If you’re a history geek too like me who loves anything old and quaint, you’ll be awed at the interior AND exterior of the building.  I absolutely couldn’t find any reason for you to NOT love the hotel. It’s really divine! I really do appreciate the hotel for it’s quiet location, really something different than what I’m used to.

Booking of the breakfast and swimming pool was easy. However, access to the swimming pool was further as we had to go through a different route to get there. We were not informed of the closure of the door closer to the room. We were also a little lost getting to the swimming pool. A clearer signpost/signages guiding us to the alternate swimming pool entrance could be useful.  Otherwise, the overall stay was great and we will be back again!",4
A getaway from city life,Hiang C,"The staff was very accommodating in allowing an early check in as we needed to prepare for a birthday surprise. The room was very clean and the view was nice. One small thing was that we could hear doors slamming quite loudly when people were exiting their rooms, especially at 7am,which I believe they were going for breakfast. The breakfast was simple, although it would be better if they hadore selections. There was a staff who was really really helpful, we were trying to find our way to Plaza Singapura and she directed us to this short cut that really helped to save time and save us from the heat!

We stayed 2 nights and walked past the entrances in the morning, afternoon and night but didn't see staff man the 2 main entrances to the hotel. The reception is situated in one corner and don't have line of sight of visitors. No one to help with luggages. No one to enforce that visitors check in and out of safe entry. No one to check if visitors taking the stairs up to the hotel rooms are registered guests. So anyone can take the stairs to access the cooridoor to the hotel rooms.

It was my husband's bdae and they gave us a slice of cake, a card and when we went to the restaurant for dinner, they gave us compliementary drinks too. The only thing that kind of dampen our trip was a huge dead cockroach we woke to in the toilet on our last day. But since we are leaving and it is already dead, we didnt provide any feedback. Nevertheless, HFC would still be one of our considerations for our future staycations.  Suggestions: to hv more hooks in the toilet to hang stuff.",5
A different experience,muralli k,"This hotel is definitely not the conventional type, it’s little different. The reception and the lobby has the fort experience(indeed its a fort). The Deluxe room was average size but the toilet layout was nice with big glass window with a view. Motorised  curtains makes it easy to close and open. The city view you get to see while showering is kind of new and cool (though not everyone may like). The staffs were really helpful in arranging things for my wife’s bday and to my surprise a cake was brought in by the room service at the stroke at 12 midnight is amazing.  Things could have been better: Soundproofing Room Lighting",4

Staycation,Nigel,"1st time staying at FCH, it’s a very old building that require constant maintenance. Nothing to complain about for such a historical building.

Great Hotel,Shahdan S,Some of parts of the room are quite old and need some refurbishment. The door hinge area quite dusty and the wardrobe has some dust. The service by hotel stuff however was exceptional. The staffs were curteous abd polite. Check in procedure was hassle free and fast,4
Staycation at hotel Fort canning,Jiaaaqiii,Good staycation. Located near the city yet enjoying the beauty of the nature Location near to MRT. 5 minutes walk Swimming pool is clean and big. Window has a beautiful scenary and can see either city area or Fort canning,5
5 star Hotel with a 3 star service,Sheila,"It was a bummer that our staycation was during the phase when dining in was not allowed. Though we felt that the hotel could have done more (eg. give more food for breakfast since guests paid for a buffet or send the complimentary drinks to the room) rather than make us think that they might just be cutting cost. Also unimpressed with the service of some staff, 1st one was the unwelcoming guy at the entrance lazily giving out the round sticker and 2nd, the one who sent me a towel when I asked for a shower gel. Nevertheless, good location, the place is quiet and the pool and bathroom are very instagrammable. We also enjoyed our walk at the nearby Fort canning park and Tree tunnel where we took some photos.",3
Average service,narma nayza,"Wanted to put 5 stars but they forgot to send cake to my room at the preferred time. I emailed in advance to receive cake for my husb's birthday at 10pm. We waited until breakfast. No cake at all. I called in to ask and they said they forgot to send the cake during breakfast. When the cake came, the card stated wrong name. Not sure if they even care to check or take request seriously. 5 stars for the room. Tip-Top cleanliness!",4
Best Birthday,Mrs H,"I booked a room at Hotel Fort Canning to celebrate my husband's birthday. From the beginning, the customer experience was divine. Maggie replied to my email promptly and offered extraordinary solutions. She was professional in her communications. We decided to visit Chinois Spa first before checking in and the spa exceeded all expectations. Every single employee we spoke to were polite and professional.   We will definitely return.",5
Quiet and Peaceful,nandychandy,It is my second visit to the hotel and it has still maintained its serenity. Staff there are always friendly and professional.   We ordered in dinner and the food was good!   Some things to improve:  1) Breakfast could be better but i guess they did the best with the no dine in option allowed.  2) The path to the swimming pool is abit long as you go to go via the Hotel lobby and to the basement and all. Wonder if a shorter route could be determined without compromising the safety measures in placed.   Other than that we would really love to go back again!   Service provided by Durga Pandey was impeccable. She was friendly and helpful.,4
Nice hotel but poor policies,Luke yap Melchizedek,"Room is nice. Hotel staff were polite. But hotel policies on some matters are disappointing   E.g only one carpark coupon per day.  E.g when I asked for more water , they said only two bottles are provided each day.",3
stayca,Shaun M,"Great service for check in, rooms are wonderfull and the hotel has lots of old world charm that is missing in the newer hotels. Great location surrounded by the iconic park. Food is great and the pool is one of the best you will find. Had a great weekend there, the bath tub is the best",5
Amazing staycation,daria,"The room was spacious, very luxurious and clean. Overall stay was 10/10. The staff was helpful, friendly and excellent in their service. Shoutout to Ivena for being super thoughtful and nice to attend to our needs. Thankyou for a great weekend!",5
Great Staycation,Tiara,"A great place to stay at in Singapore, from location and to the beautiful room. Thank you very much to Ivena for making my staycation a great and pleasant one. Truly a gem to have in your organization.",5
Average Heritage Stay,Cal_TheHotelLover,"I adore luxury heritage boutique hotels, and this is one of the few in Singapore. We book the Premium Room that comes with a verandah sitting and work area with the view of the Fort Canning park. I have to say the view is good, that makes you feel you’re not in Singapore - but do expect people taking photos of the gorgeous exterior and walking around your window.   The furnishing of the room is a little dated, but overall okay. Bed is definitely too near to the door and you can hear passerby. While the open bath is nice to see, however not practical when if you prefer to have a nice warm bath without the chill air from the AC. I do recommend a bigger TV for a room like this to fill in empty spaces.   The most disappointing thing from the stay were the breakfast. Form a 5* luxury…",3
Tired,fowkesa,"I know we are deep into Covid 19 restrictions and that may impact how the hotel presented itself. Fort canning Hotel is a colonial majestic building located on the edge of Fort Canning Park. From a distance it looks very regal but close up its lacking the polish of former days. The Glass canopy over the entrance is green with mould. I stayed there for a staycation for my 60th birthday and was given a room overlooking the driveway (park view level 1), the room was musty and dull, no opening windows. It reminded me of the quarantine hotel my wife and I were locked in for two weeks in Sydney. I seriously wanted to go home. The hotel manager showed us other rooms and we accepted a city view room with a bathroom overlooking the garden. The carpet in the main stairway had not been…",3
Pre Valentine's day staycay <3,#le2owls,"I fell in love with their Deluxe Room's bathtub when I first looked at their room photo on the hotel website and went ahead to book a night stay for our valentine's day staycation.   Although the hotel is located near to two MRTs (Dhoby Ghaut and Fort Canning) but it's away from the city and you can completely enjoy the stay with nature. It is quiet and peaceful.   The room is spacious and lovely! We loved the bathtub and the view! It gave us a feeling that we were on a holiday that was very much needed during this pandemic period.   The buffet breakfast was served in ""ala carte"" due to COVID. Limited choices but they were okay.   The checkout process was smooth.   My bf and I enjoyed the stay and we will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and family! ",5
Clean and comfy room we’ll go back to!,Neritta L,"My partner and I really enjoyed our three-night stay at the hotel. The service was excellent and staff were friendly and extremely approachable. The rooms are clean; smelling fresh, and spacious. We loved the bathroom with a spacious shower and bathtub area, and didn’t feel like we were stuck in a small space. Our room also had an extended balcony-feel room which was an extension of the main bedroom but the door partition made it feel like we had multiple rooms in one big hotel room - really loved it!   Great gym and pool facilities if you’re feeling like a good workout!!  The only feedback was our room tended to have a bit of cigarette smell coming into the room in the night - not sure if it was the aircon ventilation or how the smoke smell got in. Other than that, we’ll…",4
birthday staycation,Michelle,"Booked a one-night staycation on 3/4 - 4/4. Front dest staffs were very friendly & attended to their guests promptly. We loved our room & they even surprised us with a birthday cake! Slightly located at a more ulu place but it wasn’t so bad as there’s a nearby bus stop / you can call a cab for transport wise. The following day, we weren’t able to use the pool as it was raining (p/s did not understand the point of going down to B2 to get registered & getting our pool towel when the pool is at level 2?) therefore proceeded for our breakfast which it was disappointing and we felt cheated. Even called in before our booking to clarify on their buffet breakfast & exchanged several emails and they did not mention about SEMI BUFFET BREAKFAST at all. Basically only one main dish per…",3
Birthday celebration at HFC,Keith K,This has got to be the most unique and wonderful room we have stayed. Bed was situation in the centre of the room facing the full height bathroom that was facing the city centre.  We like that the bath room was open but yet private (full automated curtain) and the unblock view looking across the city is superb.   This deluxe king room has a very tall ceiling height. Really love it.   And thank you  for this complimentary birthday surprise.,5
Far from its glory days,Life'sTinyMiracles,"Far from its glory days  Booked a one night’s stay to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary but the hotel looked nothing like what you see on the website.   Arrival: No one to greet you or assist with your luggage upon arrival. The entire hotel was only manned by 1 lone front desk staff throughout our stay. Service is sorely lacking, slow and simply non-existent.   Room:  The deluxe room we booked is in very dire need of renovation. There are mould on the walls and torn wood strips on the floor. The planter along the length of the room windows are littered with shriveled up dead plants and dirty pebbles, which is such an unwelcoming sight to behold.   The king bed mattress was so soft (no more pocket springs inside) that it is totally sunken in and we developed lower backaches after…",1
Room for improvement,Arvin,"No shower gel, shampoo and conditioner. I had to call to get them. No iron and ironing board Tv remote was not working well.  Small details, but they matter.  Service was great, loved the HFC breakfast. Pancake was delish",4
Boring and below expectation,jt,I booked the Deluxe  room with patio . The dining table was infested with ants. The Singapore govt policy allow 2 people in same room and 2 social gatherings/day. But the hotel set their own rule that prohibit 1 visitor  even though the max people is 2 ( including registered guest )in the room.,2
Staycat,Ana,"I was here on a staycation for a few nights, and it was a very different experience. It had an away from city vibes, and I felt relaxed during my stay. As we stayed during the heightened alert, we did not have the chance to dine in. However, breakfast is delivered to the rooms. The lady at the front desk was amicable ",5
Hotel Fort Canning,Vivien,Room is clean n beautiful. Stuff are friendly. Breakfast was delivered on time. Good room service. Nice environment. Staying in the room with bathroom facing the outdoor scenery.  Fantastic experience!,5
Awesome service,Shaikh Hakam,Services was fast and efficient. Really happy staying at the hotel. Room was clean. Maybe just the tv which need to be able to connect to tablet or ipad. Overall stay was awesome. Swimming pool was clean and really happy staying here.,5
Perfect birthday stay,REBECCA T,My boyfriend managed to surprise me by coordinating with the hotel who helped to decorate the room. Imagine my delight when I opened my hotel room upon checking in to be greeted by the wonderful lovely rose petal decor. Thank you for making a memorable birthday for me. The hotel staff are polite and delightful and the hotel is very beautiful. Thank you Hotel Fort Canning,5
Staycation during Covid 19 period,Jerrypoh17,"Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Room is very cosy and we got a pretty decent view, so no issues staying indoors 90% of the time (because it was during phase 2 heightened alert). In room dining is pretty good! Highly recommend the DIY pizza. Food is always served hot and fresh.",5
A quiet and nostalgic hotel downtown SG,Jazzae80,2nd time staying in this hotel but this time for 2 nights. It’s a great hotel up on SG’s parks with a long and rich history. The room is clean and cut in a good size for a couple. Great hotel if you like to be away from the city buzz and close to nature. ,5
Solo work / retreat,Jyeo519,"Excellent service from the moment i called to enquire the rooms. Ms Maggie Chow was professional, detailed and very helpful in giving me very useful information to decide my stay. She also helped to make special arrangements for me to check in early as i have work commitments. The front desk manager duty that day was also really professional and friendly. We had a short chat but she did make me feel very welcome with her warm personality.    She made sure my check in was seamless, and also checked with me to make advanced bookings for usage of pool. I had a surprise birthday cake sent to me, in room dining food is also very good. It would have been better to expand food options but i must say the quality is pretty good.  Overall, service is excellent! I have had several requests…",5
POOR SERVICE. LACK OF AMENITIES.,Cheryl T,"I would like to comment on my stay at Hotel Fort Canning on 18th – 19th May, particularly about one of your service staff.    POOR QUALITY OF SERVICE STAFF   During check-in, there was a staff who attended to us. He, in my honest opinion, was the most unhelpful counter staff ever. He literally got our details, and gave us the card to the room. Didn’t bother with the rest of the information. 1.	Prior to checking in, the couple before us was also just given the card to their room, and was haphazardly pointed to the lift, with no proper directions whatsoever. I had stayed here previously, and from my experience during my previous stay 4 years ago, the service staff were friendly enough to walk us to the lift that was hidden in the corner. 2.	During check -in, he did not bother to…",1
Relaxing and well-fed,Ekng-yeo,The reservation team was very proactive in contacting me on the guideline changes due to covid.   We signed up for the picnic pkt and were very happy with the entire experience (plus tummies).  This was 2nd stay...i believe...more to come.  Kudos.,5
Romantic room and view,Chang,"Booked a anniversary staycation with my partner and even though the hotel told us the room would be decorated romantically, it seems as though they forgot. Aside from that the room was spacious and had a beautiful view of the front lawn and sky through the pretty toilet. Service upon arrival was decent and generally nice, however we were on a relatively lower level and were constantly afraid of being seen through the window out front, due to the wedding ceremony that was being held. Breakfast was delivered to the room and a tad bit disappointing, mostly due to the COVID restrictions, compared to the buffet breakfast, the spread of food and quality were decent but nothing special is to be said about it. Overall it was satisfactory, mostly due to the room environment and hotel…",3
If only I can give 0 star!,Wils,"Booked this hotel to celebrate my wife's birthday but the following experience ruined it:  1. Reserved swimming pool at specific time at front desk but was questioned by pool attendant if we had booked and almost got rejected.   2. Called front desk and housekeeping for 1 additional shower gel but it never came.  3. Was delighted that Hotel management had prepared a cake for my wife. Called to arrange for the cake to be served immediately, guess what? They forgot about it totally. The cake only came the next day when I reminded them ""when is my breakfast coming and the cake?"". Nice~  +point, room was spacious but shower head was leaking water.  Conclusion, first and last. Really bad!",1
Room layout unique,Rae CT,"Their service is excellent, attentive and also well responsive. Love the bathroom very cosy with full windows!

"Very comfortable and lush stay, but some things could be improved.",Itchybee,"What I loved: Loved the comfortable bed and pillows. Loved the way the sunbeams shone in through the French patio doors in the quiet afternoon . Loved the (almost) private patio connected to my room. Loved the awesome pool which was surrounded by trees! Location: lush yet central—-Fort Canning Park is an amazing place,glad there’s a hotel in the middle of it! My husband and I had a great time there, resting and relaxing. Plus we had beautiful strolls in fort canning park in the evening and morning. We even walked to Clarke quay nearby for dinner. lovely lovely walk and media detox.  What could be improved: 1. The breakfast , tho’ tasty, was a little lacking in variety. No cheese selection, no asking what kind of yoghurt I liked even though they stated “selection of yoghurts…",4
Highly recommended,Ping,"Love the serene ambience, the welcoming experience, the food at breakfast. My second staycation at HFC. A walk at fort canning park brought us back briefly to Bali. Love the clean pool. Hope to visit again",5

Rustic Retreat in the City,Larry M,"For those who ops for rustic retreat in the city , Hotel Fort Canning would not disappoint. Excellent reservation staff and helpful housekeeping team. Only bad point is the quality of food and options in The Salon. The western and local food cuisine is below par. Overall, the peaceful retreat at Fort Canning Park is the real deal.",5
Breakfast is terrible!,lala m,"I never ever eat such a Eggs Benedict.   The bread was croissants and the sauce was just a large amount of mayonnaise. It's just mayonnaise. It was probably made by a person who had never eaten Egg benetict. Even a cheap hotel wouldn't want to put such a food on the menu list. Surprisingly, it took 40 minutes.   I'm sure this hotel won't survive. I've stayed at various hotels, but this hotel isn't worth the price. You had better stay at Goodwood or Hilton.",2
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay,Alvin L,"Stayed 2 nights in a ground floor inter-connecting room with king size beds. The room was wonderful, clean and with comfortable beds and pillows.   We went to the pool everyday and it was extremely enjoyable for the kids, not crowded at all partly because we had to reserve a pool slot due to COVID safe distancing measures but it wasnt difficult if you reserve it early.   Its nice to be able to take a walk through Fort Canning Park, in summary, we had an enjoyable stay.",5
Nice experience ,Cay28,"Nice hotel to experience, comfy bed, good customer service and nice gym to check out. Only set back is the hotel bit old it’s time to refurbish. Hygiene standard can be improved. Will recommend to those people who like nature. ",3
Worth the stay,Myame_hits,"We choose this hotel as we like the vibe of ""heritage hotels"", somewhat it's homey and relaxed plus the fact that when you go out, the park is there. The deluxe room was spacious, with a high ceiling, very nice interiors, mirrored closet, comfortable sheets, and above all really nice glass bathroom with a city view. By far this is the best pool that we had in SG, it's chlorine-free. The only downside we experienced is the way going to the pool, as you need to go through the car park, instead of direct access from the second level. Though we understand their measures due to the pandemic.  The staffs were the best, very accommodating. Overall we enjoyed our stay in HFC, it was worth the stay, and will definitely recommend it to others.",5
I'll be back,ZannL,"We have shortlisted a few hotel including Hotel Fort Canning in our initial stage of looking for a staycation, and ended up with Hotel Fort Canning because of it's location.   We didn't regret a single bit for choosing Hotel Fort Canning, as the location is located near Orchard, making getting very accessible. From check in to checking out, the staff have been very friendly and helpful. Thank you for being so passionate in tough times like this.   The room is by far one of the best that we have stayed in. With the size of the room being very spacious, high ceiling, all the way till the bathroom, even for Deluxe Room.

Lacking somewhat...room for improvement,swooosh7,"First the good things: 1) quiet and restful - the hotel was probably not at full occupancy when we checked in so it was very serene all around. Put aside the need to rush and enjoy the lush surroundings on-site and that afforded by the beautiful park nearby 2) service is prompt - maybe not so at the bar and restaurant; seemed under-staffed but the front desk, housekeeping and room service leave nothing to complain about 3) well-maintained property - it's probably due for a refurbishment soon but no worn carpets, peeling furniture or yellowing walls. Room was largely well-maintained, which brings me to the areas for improvement: 1) our bathroom faced the city and while they did have the massive blind over the huge window for privacy, I wish it were a little more customisable so…",4

Not so celebratory birthday.,Cheyenne Tan,"Came here for a birthday getaway but was extremely underwhelmed overall. The hotel is getting 2 stars just purely because of how nice their staff were.  Lady at the reception counter when we checked in and out was super lovely, 10/10 for positive vibes and helpfulness. She gave us a later checkout since it was my birthday plus we were checking out on a Monday and I’m sure they didn’t have many guests from Sunday to Monday.  In terms of special treatment for a special occasion.... we never got a room upgrade which other hotels would probably have given. Perhaps that’s why many of my family friends in the hospitality industry were puzzled at our choice of staycay hotel. They called us via the room phone and also upon checking in and mentioned that they’d like to give us a birthday…",2

Fantastic Stay,Michelle,"It was a fantastic stay with Hotel Fort Caning. Check-in and Check-out process was fast and fuss-free. We booked the Deluxe room.

Quiet tranquil,Dayah Ayid,"Booked a deluxe garden room for 2 nights. Great place to relax and unwind as the place is very quiet. Beautiful lobby. Room bed is huge and comfy. Pool is big enough. Love the huge and deep bath tub but since its smack beside the bed, the floor is wet and slippery when in use and since its a marble flooring so please avoid wearing room slipper or u may fall like i did. Overall, love my stay at HFC",4

The gardens are at the front, the free-standing bathtub is at the back. Open bathrooms & big soaking tubs. Cosy & Spacious.

They did appear slightly understaffed but was acceptable.   Hot tips: - ask for your Citibank credit card promo at salon, very value for money   - one for one drinks deal from 4 to 8pm - request for higher floor room ",5
Honeymoon,Fatin Aqilah,"We recently had our honeymoon staycation at hotel Fort Canning. We absolutely love it! It was peaceful and beautiful as it was up in the hill surrounded by nature. You could just head out from the lobby and walk into Fort Canning park. The staff was friendly and mindful to create something creative in our room. We love the food as we did ordered in dining all time, it wasn’t cheap like how you would dine in cafes but the meal was enough to be shared by 2 people. We enjoyed our time in the pool as it was huge! We love our view as our room was facing the park, we could see rooster walking around. Absolutely a true bliss to choose Hotel Fort Canning if you want a getaway from the busy city. We didn’t want to leave but sadly our honeymoon was ending. Definitely will be coming back…",5

Hotel was recommended by my friend and I can fully recommend this place to who wants to have nice and calm stay.

Nice Hotel but showing signs of aging ,JazzyJas,"2nd visit to the hotel, last being some years back. Could visibly tell the difference from wear and tear.

Lovely ambience!,Walter Lee,"Amazing experience! The hotel staff were extremely accommodating and polite, and the room and toilet were great. Only complaint is that the breakfast is pretty bad. The food was served after 40 minutes because the kitchen staff forgot our order and we had to check again with the waiter. After a few dishes were served, the rest of our items never came and we had to re-order our food again. The quality of the food is pretty bad as well, with cold watery scrambled eggs and cold eggs benedict without hollandaise sauce being the main offenders. But on the upside, the gym is big and well-equipped, and the pool has a pretty aesthetic during golden hour. I will definitely come back here and recommend my friends to come here too!

Birthday Staycation,CininThai,"Our room included an enclosed “balcony” and was well appointed although the many light/control switches took time to figure out and were not arranged logically.  The bar is centrally located just off the lobby and we enjoyed drinks and snacks there on several occasions. The one restaurant however was nondescript and the breakfast was very disappointing.   There is clearly a shortage of staff although all were friendly, accommodating and tried to be attendant.  They met all our requests despite the additional need to cover several weddings during our stay.  Location of the hotel in Fort Canning Park in central Singapore and adjacent to the quays is awesome. Plus we thoroughly enjoyed our tour of The Battlebox which covers the British Allied Command and surrender to Japan in WWII.",4

Very nice hotel but disappointed by facilities closed,venga tan,"It is an excellent hotel by its nature and the room were wonderful - for the price and it was my exact birthday stay, it was above Westin and some of the other high end hotels at the stay. However, i was greatly disappointed the jacuzzi, steamroom and sauna were closed permanently due to 'COVID' as it was my big to-do for my birthday stay.  Just having stayed at Westin and several other five star rooms as staycation over the past 2-3 months during COVID - many of them maintained COVID Policies whilst keeping the facilities open - so it was not value for money during my stay.  In addition, the breakfast options were limited and the breakfast tables were not set properly with any decor, utensils, coffee and tea sugar/creamer etc and looked like a bare canteen for the status of the…",3
"Escape from Singapore, in Singapore",Tim Kai,"Are you tired of being at home? Bored of the mundane activities of daily life? My friends and I were. We wanted a little break and get away for a bit, so we decided to go on a staycation. It’s safe to say we couldn’t have picked a better place. Hotel Fort Canning was amazing from the moment we arrived right up until the end. As we stepped out of our cab we were immediately greeted and promptly shown to the check-in desk. Everyone was so friendly and helped in every way they could to make the check in process as smooth and as efficient as possible. The staff was so helpful with anything we needed during our stay. While there I would highly suggest going downstairs for a meal. The food itself is enough for a visit to this hotel. Try their chocolate lava cake it’s molten center…",5
Staycation,Christopher Oh,Excellent hotel. One of the best I ever stayed in. The view was exquisite and service was impeccable. The staff were extremely kind and location was a 10 min walk from Clarke quay. Would definitely recommend.,5

They took their initiatives, particular mention for the staff at The Salon restaurant and the front office reception. They made their guests feel very welcome. Thank you!",5
Great Stay. Large room,Mammons,Probably one of the larger hotel room ever catered in Singapore. Especially the toilet. Overall experiences were pretty pleasant and enjoying.  Staff were extremely helpful and considerate.   Highly recommended to all.,5

Excellent staycation,Jerry Tan,"Stayed in HFC over the weekends with my fiancée and friends. The hotel was thoughtful enough to provide a cake and card to celebrate her birthday.

A quiet and serene alternative place for staycation ,Rene Sophia,"This hotel has been in my wishlist for awhile based on what I have read or seen. Finally I  chose this hotel for my simple and quiet birthday celebration. And it has not disappoint me. :) I was presented with a piece of a birthday cake sent to my room.  My family stayed at room no 202 and 203 - a deluxe and a premier room. The surrounding is quiet and laidback, with a tint of rustic, colonial setting. Fort Canning park is just next to the hotel. All staff, from reception, restaurants and conceige are friendly and helpful. The Chinese lady at the reception has been particularly helpful and polite attending to my breakfast query. Bathrooms are spacious and clean, with a vanity table and sink just outside the bathroom. Amenities provided are complete.  The only downside is, as I…",4

Nature and City in One,A M,"Highlights include: room design, excellent view of the park from the room, smart switches for lighting and blinds, beautiful furnishings, Nespresso machine in the room, deep tub and rain shower.  Instead of a breakfast buffet, we were offered an ala carte buffet, which we enjoyed because of the personalised and pleasant service of the staff at the restaurant. The roti prata with dal, pandan nasi lemak, apricot muffins and the egg options were our favourites. The hotel's roti prata and nasi lemak are delicious and true to the flavour of these local signatures.   We felt very safe with the measures taken such as temperature reading, booking of slots for the pool, gym and breakfast for safe distancing measures during covid season. They also offered surgical masks and hand…",5
Some hits and more misses ,Summer,"Was looking forward to my stay at the deluxe garden room during Christmas and was disappointed overall.  Misses:  1) TV wasn’t working when we entered the room. Technician had to restart the TV and change our remote.  2) Even after restarting the TV, channels were slow to load ie even after staying at the channel for 5 mins the TV was still showing a black screen even though we could hear the show. Called in the operator line and was told it take time to load. Unfortunately it took too long (or in some cases, never). Ended up watching HBO throughout the stay because that’s the only channel whereby image was loaded in addition to audio.  3) Felt stuffy when we first entered the room and adjusted the air con to the lowest temperature and highest fan speed. Room was still stuffy…",3
One of a kind experience,Kat,"Our one-night stay at Hotel Fort Canning (HFC) was the best staycation experience that we have had so far! It was indeed an experience and not just a simple stay -- everything from the amazing service to the delicious food and the beautiful surroundings helped to make it an unforgettable experience!   Service-wise, the incredible service of the HFC staff was definitely one of the highlights of our stay! The staff were always extremely friendly and offered assistance proactively when we looked lost or were trying to find our way to some of the facilities. They showed us to our room and explained to us the various features and functions available, and this excellent service and hospitality continued even as we were dining in the hotel's restaurant. Speaking of dining, we had…",5
certainly an oasis in Singapore,malnit,"We happened to be there just as COVID-19 was ramping, and really enjoyed our stay there.  The happy hour was great to mingle with other travellers and exchange stories, the balcony converted into a bathroom was fun, the proximity to places of interest was good, and overall the experience was great.  Will definitely visit again.",5
Beautiful hotel and service,Suzanne S,"Such an oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  The old colonnial style of the hotel is reflected in the calming and restful environment in the hotel.  Our room was beautiful - plenty of room with a separate large bathroom area with bathtub and large shower.   The electric roman blinds were a great touch.  The staff could not do enough for us, being very professional yet friendly and approachable.  I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and book again at the drop of a hat.  Thank you for a lovely stay.",5
Historical hotel,590biscuit,"Fabulous hotel with a history. Small hotel but excellent service, lovely rooms although the bathrooms were a bit disconcerting !

There wasnt much reviews on the hotel’s restaurant so my expectations wasnt high and was not really looking forward, but i enjoyed the breakfast buffet + their lobster nasi lemak!   Only thing was the pillows was not suitable for me, and i wasnt aware there is a pillow menu ):  So those who are planning to go can take note of this!",5
Lovely colonial hotel.,Aprilcake,"The hotel is set within Fort Canning Park within 5 - 10 mins walk of 2 MRT stations.  Initial impressions were good although our greeting at reception was a bit brusque.  I fully appreciate that the hotel was concerned about coronavirus, as were we, but the first words out of the man at reception was “I need to take your temperature”.  A hello and welcome would have been nice first as we had been travelling for over 20 hours.  It was good that they also did this daily at breakfast and also before I could use the gym.  Our room was lovely but, as others have said, you are unable to use the bathroom without putting the electric blinds down first.  The design of the shower meant that water leaked onto the bathroom floor. This is because the door sits on a raised piece of marble so…",4
Loved the complimentary wine and aperitifs every afternoon,MelB,A truly unique hotel stay in Singapore amongst the greenery of Fort Canning Park. The hotel is atmospheric and beautifully appointed.  Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station for easy access to everything in Singapore. Staff were only too happy to accommodate our every need and assisted with lots of useful sightseeing advice! The restaurant was delicious and inexpensive. The swimming pools were perfect and complimentary towels appreciated. Our only recommendation would be that the raised tile edge around the bath in the room is a trip / toe stubbing hazard for travellers in unfamiliar rooms during night time bathroom visits. ( We had a garden view room).,4
Excellent Location,essexale,"In the middle of a park with easy walk to Orchard Road when going down, but there are some escalators on the way up. There are 2 swimming pools, and at the time we were there no one else was using them. Would stay there again.",5
Nice historic place,texasflattop,"Hotel Fort Canning was converted to a hotel from being the headquarters of the British government when it occupied Singapore.  The hotel has a nice tropical ambience.  The rooms are spacious and situated so that the tropical feel is there.  Overall, a bit expensive but worth it.",5

Good central location with very welcoming staff,John E,"Good location if you are fit enough to handle the steps/slopes to walk back through the lovely park back from the the city and/or are happy to use taxis. Really good swimming pool areas. Breakfast was very good. Garden room not really worth the extra cost since, given the humidity, we didn't use the facility much.  Complimentary drinks and canapes  between 6pm and 7pm  a nice touch. Hotel staff very helpful and welcoming.",4
View from the Hill,Cassowary56,"The hotel is in a graceful old (but well refurbished) building at the top of a hill top park near the CBD. I had a very comfortable room with a patio - although note that curtains need to be deployed to have privacy from anyone walking past, Easy walking distance to several excellent museums through a lovely park (dont miss the Apothecary's Garden). After a long humid day exploring Singapore it was lovely to come back to the hotel for a swim and to relax in comfortable surrounds. Staff always at the ready to assist.",5
Amazing Stay,Amirah F,"Stayed at HFC because we had a concert held at FC itself. It was accessible for us. Booked a Deluxe room for 1 night and upgraded to Deluxe Garden another night. Total stay was 3 days 2 nights. Both rooms were beautiful! Brought some friends over the second day to chill before the concert however, the staff informed that they could only stay up till 930pm which was totally fine with us. Overall, we were pleased with they stay! Would definitely come back again especially if there are concerts that are playing at FC!",5
Awesome experience,474valc,"We did our wedding here at HFC and also stayed here for a few nights. The experience was way beyond our expectations. The hotel is beautiful, styled in old colonial style, complete with all the most modern facilities. Staff are one of the most amazing team of people I’ve ever met! From the front reception to the concierge, from the banquet staff to the restaurant/bar team - everyone fully demonstrated service with a smile - making our stay the most pleasant ever. The complimentary drinks (sparkling, red and white wines + juices) n canapés served daily at the nice reception area for all guests was definitely a delight. We weren’t the only ones who were blown away. In total we had 7 rooms of friends and relatives who stayed here too and all of them were full of praises for HFC.…",5

top class service,occasional_typo,"We stayed for two nights and in a standard room. The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms luxurious - high ceilings and marble everything in the bathroom.  The high ceilings made the room feel a lot more spacious and our large windows looked towards Canning Park.  We were advised on checkin that there was a wedding the following night but we didn't hear a thing so the noise did not disturb us.  It is lovely to walk around the park in the early morning and it is very close to the MRT, Clarke Quay and the Singapura Mall.  But the standout for me was the service on the front desk.  They diligently but respectfully took our temperatures on checkin and when we asked them to daily (due to the corona virus precautions).  They helped with grab taxis and information but I was…",5
Fantastic hotel!,twitcher10,"We loved everything about this hotel! The staff were so polite and helpful getting us taxis. The room was very clean with a great bed and shower!

Most importantly every member of staff, without exception, was courteous and attentive. They are all relaxed, approachable and so very professional.

Wonderful staycation,jforcasper,"We usually do walks and exercises at the Fort Canning park and everytime we pass by the hotel we always like the vibe hence we plan to stay one day. Now that we are in, the impression we had is the same or even better.  The location is within the city center, accessible by a few walks from both Fort Canning and Dhoby Gaut MRT stations. Despite the city location this hotel is tucked within the greens of the park giving you that peaceful and relaxing feel.  Check in was a breeze, i like the sit down-table kind of style, very personalized. Julian was attentive and thorough, he also took time to walk me through the amenities of the room, very good customer service.   The room is well divided, it has modern amenities with classic interiors. I really love the bathroom, very spacious…",4

Quiet ambience although shops are slightly far from Hotel. Thank you HFC!",5
Quality hotel at a great price,Julie W,An old style hotel brought up to date in a quiet location in the park but actually only a short walk downhill to canal and places to eat and shop.  We chose this place because we don’t like the huge corporate type soulless hotels and because it is in a quieter location. It came at a competitive price compared with the corporate hotels so perfect. The room was excellent with everything we could need and a comfortable sleep. Breakfast gave a good choice of Western and Eastern choices.  Two pools which were always quiet. A pity the sun-beds don’t have mattresses There is a restaurant for evening meals with the typical mix of meals.  A nice touch was the free guest drink between 6 and 7.   Perhaps a member of staff could circulate and give guests an opportunity to ask questions…,4
Wonderful stay in a characterful colonial hotel ,Steven D,"Stayed at Hotel Fort Canning on a recommendation from two friends who had stayed and we were delighted we did. Wonderful colonial building set in historic Fort Canning. Great location 10 min walk from Orchard Road and the MTR and 15 minutes walk through the park to Clarke Quay on the river. Very much a garden oasis in the middle of Singapore. I exercised regularly in the Park as well as the in house gym (lots of great kit).  We arrived about 2pm and checked in without a wait. Really nice room - feature is the bathroom at the window end of the room. Good lighting and storage. The two swimming pools are wonderful and manage a garden feel.   Service was excellent.   This is not a big chain hotel so less staff and the team multi tasks. Reception doubles as the concierge, as well as…",5
Classic Colonial Hotel,Richard,This hotel is a perfect example of the reuse of a classic colonial style building. The location is excellent within the park and easy walking distance to the city. Rooms are large and well presented with all features of the rooms very useable. Good size pool. Restaurant is good and buffet breakfast excellent. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly. May not be the cheapest in town but definitely worth it. Would definitely stay again if stopping over in Singapore.,5

Enjoyable stay in Singapore’s ,r0bb2014,"Hotel Fort Canning is a great hotel to stay whilst visiting Singapore, our room was very comfortable, the staff friendly and efficient service.

"Great hotel, location and service!",Fioncee,"We enjoyed the location and convenience of Hotel Fort Canning because it's in town and there are a lot of things to do. But at the same time, the lush greenery and quietness surrounding the hotel (it's on Fort Canning Hill) makes for a calming respite.   Service was excellent and I just want to call out Kelson Yeo for his welcoming and great attitude too!",5
There are better hotels in Singapore,portlandmom12,"My room was ok.  Comfortable bed and pillows.  Nicely appointed bathroom.  Strange to have the windows all along the bathroom.  Breakfast was a letdown.  Getting taxis takes some time. And, getting a taxi to find the entrance to the hotel was quite complicated.",3
"Excellent service, food and accommodation.",NickJB2014,"The hotel is set in a small park in the centre of Singapore. The building has a colonial history as has the surrounding area. Positioned on a hill the park has covered escalators to acess the nearest metro station. The bedroom was a good size, with a large comfortable bed, as was the bathroom which had a bath and seperate shower.  Public rooms are of a reasonable size, well decorated and comfortably furnished. Staff went out of their way to be helpful. Breakfast, lunch and dinner menus were good, with local dishes, but fairly limited.  Complimentary drinks and nibbles between 6 and 7 were appreciated by most guests, plus an extended Happy Hour in the bar and restaurnt.",5
Nice Hotel but lacking sparkle,AF52,"I would stay at the Fort Canning again But it lacks that edge of a great hotel The service was good but not outstanding,the bar service was disappointing and we had to go to the bar to get served on nearly every occasion even though  there was no one else in the bar The room for me was on the small side and the bathroom which is two walls of glass  was a little disconcerting for me That said the bed was very comfortable and we slept well A very nice and quiet hotel The breakfast was good but not outstanding after the Hyatt in Vietnam  and the Sofitel in Cambodia",4
Not the best choice for Singapore ,Vaidoo,"I know this City well and had lived here for 10 years, came back to visit. Picked this hotel due to its colonial appeal. Quite misleading, tiny claustrophobic rooms, very inconvenient to go back and forth from, barely any actual colonial ambience. Room cleanliness mediocre. I would definitely not recommend this hotel given the plenty of choices Singapore has to offer that are much better, more convenient and come at a much more attractive price. I give it a poor rating.

A Magical Oasis,markhoman1962,"This was my third stay at Hotel Fort Canning, I must repeat comments I made on my previous posts regarding this hotel. It really is a beautiful hotel in the most stunning gardens, it's tranquillity amongst the busy Singapore City makes this place so unique. Two beautiful swimming pools and relaxing area's to sit in out out of the sun, great breakfast and excellent staff.

We LOVE this hotel!,Missy,"We have stayed at this hotel on the last 3 visits to Singapore & love it. The staff, the location, the service, the food, the pools. It is our oasis holiday on our journeys to Europe.  And we enjoy it so much that we always stay a few days.  On a visit last July our child got sick, and we had to extend our trip to 1 week. The staff were so helpful with advising where to go for the best doctors & accommodating us during quite a stressful time.  Can not thank them or recommend them enough.",5

We have also personally stayed in the hotel on several occasions both for holidays and work reasons.   The rooms and facilities are very pleasant, however  the main reason we continue coming back to this location is the staff. The hotel staff are always very thoughtful, I always get the impression that they have carefully considered my request and done their best to acomodate it (even if sometimes the answer is no, in general it is clear they have clearly thought very hard about how/whether they could make it possible). Overall this makes the hotel a very relaxed place to deal…",5
"Superb, prompt and friendly service and a great location",Suranga d W,I have been to Singapore many times. Always staying at whatever shopping district and looking out to busy streets or smack into other buildings. This time around the weekend was about relaxation. Hotel Fort Canning is on top of a hill and park. When you lookout the window its either greenery or distant buildings. No cars zooming pass. Awesome rooms as well. I love the location and the staff was always on point and ready to be of assistance. The best part of this hotel is its staff and the location. The rooms are very clean and modern too. I could not believe such a chill place existed in this busy city.,5
Luxury Oasis in a Bustling City,drmgeorge,"I only had the pleasure of spending one night at Ft. Canning, but it was an excellent night! The hotel itself is charming and old world and the setting high on a hill in the middle of an urban forest park is gorgeous. The hotel was convenient to the sights of Singapore while being quite and secluded at the same time. My room was spacious and well appointed and most importantly, luxuriously comfortable and quiet. The pools are wonderful, and I appreciated a separate lap pool. I hope to be able to return someday.  ",5
Beautiful and majestic hotel,Silvia S,My husband and I stayed here for two nights during our short visit to Singapore this January. We absolutely loved the location of this hotel as it was on top of Fort Canning Park. We felt so peaceful and secluded from the busy streets of Singapore.   The hotel rooms are lovely and have high ceilings. I used the gym once and they had a good range of equipment. Since the hotel is in a park you could definitely go outside for a run.  I would highly recommend this hotel! ,5

Beautifully restored heritage hotel with great hospitality,ElatiorG,"Hotel Fort Canning is a pleasant surprise in the urban jungle of Singapore.  Despite being conveniently located in the central of Singapore, it’s nestled within lush greenery and away from then city hustle.  The colonial hotel exterior is grandiose, yet the facilities of the hotel room is very updated and technologically advanced.  The beautiful fusion of history and modern comfort makes the stay with Hotel Fort Canning a memorable one.  Was especially impressed with the white marbled bathroom boasting the garden view.  The design of the hotel room also allows abundant sunlight and great view of the surrounding foliage.

A quiet sophisticated stay in a historic building,Dinah B,"I loved the ""welcome back"" I received from the front desk and the fact that they were able to check us in early with no bother.  The pool area is lovely though the sun beds/round pool loungers could do with some padding/mattresses.  The hotel was extremely quiet for the festive period which I guess is why they tried to shut the bar at 10:45pm one night!  Seems a bit early for a 5 star hotel.  My only other grumble was again related to the bar - there seemed to be a very young and inexperienced chap serving who just didn't seem ready to be (mainly) left on his own to serve drinks.  Poor kid looked petrified at times.  Other than that, it is my favourite hotel in Singapore, just a few steps away from the Battle Box tour (of an Underground Bunker used by the Allies during the…",4
Disappointing and distressed,carly388,For a hotel that boasts a 5 star rating you would hope that they have a more understanding and sympathetic reservations and customer service team.  I've had to cancel a planned trip in February due to some distressing personal circumstances. Given the advanced notice I thought I'd receive a more understanding response from the hotel. I understand there are cancellation rules with third party bookings but after asking to explore options and seeing if a solution could be reached (ie paying a cancellation fee etc) I then received a message that was a flat no they cannot help me at all and that I should 'keep my reservation'. I think there should be exceptions in certain circumstances for unexpected situations. I do know that I will not be going to Singapore as planned just to 'keep…,1
Wonderfully quiet stay in heart of singapore,Peter K,We stayed for three nights and had a view over the city. It’s set in a wonderful old building and we had canapés and drinks each evening.

Very nice stay,Séverine,"We were in Singapore several times for business purposes and we appreciated a lot. That is why we have decided to stay a short week for tourism purposes this year. The some years ago, I was in the hotel Fort Canning and I had a good memory of my stay and especially the fact that this hotel is in the heart of a beautiful park.

"Atmospheric hotel, comfortable stay",AsianGM,"Was booking a 1 night stay due to a friend's  event in the hotel. Even though I drive around Singapore I was caught out when my GPS directed me via Coleman street up Canning Rise. But this road is now closed past the Registry of Marriage. You can only reach this hill top hotel in Canning Walk via Stamford Rd.   I'd booked via a booking portal and had been worried since the room was for friends, not a couple, as all the photos showed transparent glass bathrooms, some apparently with the bathtub in the actual bedroom.   However upon a speedy check in I was glad to find there were roman blinds separating the bathroom (renovated on the former balcony). Even so, the receptionist reminded me three times to close the blinds to the huge window as people can look straight in.   Though…",4
"Nice hotel, location an issue",Doug E,"There are many nice things about this hotel.  The room was amazing and beautiful and relaxing.  The breakfast buffet was comprehensive.  The staff were very nice, sometimes too nice.  I felt like they wanted to make me happy even when they really weren't sure what they were saying:  bad directions, strange consequences of questions asked.  The setting is beautiful; the park is gorgeous.  But that was one of the problems I had with the hotel, which they can't change obviously.  The hotel is kind of isolated from things, which is saying something in a city like Singapore.  It takes some time to get to the subway stations or to walk anywhere.  So, there's nothing wrong with the hotel, and I'd stay there again, but I probably would probably try to get a hotel closer to the CBD.",4
It's the little things,Therese P,"Yes the rooms are well appointed, comfortable,  tech controlled,  but the service at the front desk win us over. Sheats with a smile,  happy to help and they even sent birthday cake to 2 of my traveling companions (they must have noted their birthdays from their passports 😉). Highly recommend. ",5
Nice hotel,Naresh Kumar,Nice hotel Love the bathroom concept Clean and tidy Suitable for couples and solo Not so sure for families Breakfast was so so Pool was very clean. Thankfully not so crowded Loved the bicentennial event which took place beside the hotel. Which was very convenient,5
Unique Location,932Wolf932,"This hotel is different from almost all other hotels in its location in a park. Very quiet for Singapore, yet in the middle of the city. Good museums nearby (National Museum, Battle Box). Make sure to request a room facing the park on the 3rd floor. Less than 5 minutes walk to 3 different MRT (metro/underground) stations. 4/5 stars because breakfast buffet is adequate but not overwhelming. Nice seating outside. Pool is very nice, hardly used. Separate lap pool. Rooms are unusually well designed, minibar gets restocked. Room Service is very friendly and is very good. This is more of a honeymoon / holiday type of hotel, rather than business. They do have a lot of weddings - held on the city-facing side of the hotel. This is why you should request a room on the park-facing side.…",4
In Singapore for U2 Concert,cK Ong,"This is my 3rd stay in 2019. Came for the U2 concert, left with much much more, thanks to a series of fortunate events. We ended up being invited to preview chef Jeffrey Tan's Xmas Otak-otak Turkey. Considering otak-otak is a steamed fish cake, one would have thought fish and poultry don't mix. But his otak base was chicken with traditional otak spices and otak stuffing served with roast vegetables and potatoes. The turkey turned out extremely tender and moist, especially the breast, even the drumstick was not left behind.  The awesome turkey lunch came with the hotel's world class fish head curry served with crispy roti prata and briyani rice, pork pong teh, nyonya chap chye and a heaping mound of Singapore Hokkien Mee with oodles of prawns.  Needless to say, both my ears and…",5
Fantastic stay; fantastic location!,Graham,We visited for a friend’s birthday and stayed for 5 nights. The staff couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful. The room was lovely with lovely views. Unsung hero’s; the cleaners who looked after our room. It was immaculate each time we returned after a day out. Would certainly stay again!,5
"Great scenery, great service",Miss G,"A great escape from the city life of Singapore, yet still comfortable and homely. View from room was the park view so we had the view of the Fort Canning park. However, would have appreciated if the windows were tinted so we can still enjoy the view without having fear of people looking in.",4
Great stay,Agent001,"Booked a one night stay as we were in town for the U2 concert, plus it was our wedding anniversary.  Got a free upgrade to their Junior Suite, which was spacious (Corner room), overlooking the pool.  Nice and relaxed stay, not too crowded. Would come again. ",5
Lovely elegant hotel in historic heart of Singapore,kathrynhelen3,"Spent three nights at Hotel Fort Canning, with my elderly mother, stopover between Australia and UK. Loved the hotel. Former British colonial admin building, used also I think as Japanese army HQ during war. Set in park, surrounded by lush greenery, it has a lovely feeling of space, of being away from the bustle of the city yet everything is easily accessible. Literally on the door step of the fascinating Battle Box and a stone’s throw from the National Museum. Room was very comfortable with stunning bathroom, though had to close the blinds between the sleeping area and the bathroom, not sure who would appreciate having the toilet in plain view of the rest of the room? Breakfast was fine, slightly eclectic mix of western and Asian cuisines. Ate dinner there one night as…",5
Future world,Malcolm,"The place is located within a beautiful gardens which overlooks the city. The meals were excellent and great variety, buffet breakfast. You are able to walk to all the great attractions with ease. The staff were all friendly and could help with any requests.  We weren't able to get a late check out but were given full access to the hotel and members club until the time we were required to leave for the airport. Highly recommend this place for a getaway to Singapore to explore the city.",5
Excellent service and scenic environment,Sora,"Here for a night stay for my boyfriends birthday,brought a cake as a surprise&it was served along with complimentary cake for him too, was also wished belated birthday by the receptionist while i was checking in as he saw it on my identification card.Its located in the park on the hill so the room scenery is really beautiful.The staff is friendly and overall it gives a warm welcoming feeling,really enjoy my stay here and definitely will come back again. (^^)",5
An echo of the colonial era,Biggles74,"In a city of glass and steel, Fort Canning is an oasis of traditional architecture nestled in an expanse of greenery.  Beautifully-appointed rooms and interiors, delightful staff, and a sense of the history of old Singapore that is so rapidly being built over in the city centre.  Great location for the National Museum and for those interested in the military history of the island State, a pleasant stroll to the shopping areas and good access to the MRT.",5
Is just better and better ! Best hotel in Singapore,coll612,"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel for many years now- it is THE best place in Singapore if you’d like an urban Oasis right in the city centre. Amazing converted government building. From reservations by the welcoming Maggie through to guest service team on welcome- Shana and Ivana- To Steven and his restaurant team namely Shri and Ruby and of course not forgetting Long term manager- Kelson- this hotel never fails to disappoint. Pricing is certainly comparable to most in Singapore but this hotel is boutique, spacious and absolutely First class. We will continue to return as it is simply gets better and better with age. Thanks HFC for another memorable stay at your hotel",5
Very nice hotel,Kylie,"The hotel was very nice, rooms neat, well serviced. Conference room was also very good - food excellent- would recommend it for conferences. Convenient location, 10 min walk to Orchard Rd etc. Would definitely stay there again.",4
"Clean, beautiful rooms",McLarenSenna,"We picked the premium room, which wasn't as expensive as the name suggests, but it felt more than premium! The room came with a balcony and a large bathroom with a bathtub. The place looked freshly renovated and incredibly clean as well!",5
A Great Stay!,Syasyah,"We've celebrated our anniversary here and the staffs greeted us warmly when we arrived. Its smooth sailing as when we've arrived, our rooms are ready. We've book the deluxe room and its very huge and spacious! We've been brought to our room and staff showed us around the room on how to use the controllers and informing us on what is complimentary in the room which is already a thumbs up.   The location is great, about 10mins walk down to Dhoby Ghaut mrt or Plaza Singapura. The hotel itself is beautiful.   The amenities in the room, the bed is huge, the controllers for the lighting and curtains are all on touchscreen panel. The toilet is grand, there's shower and bathtub and basic toiletries are provided. There are karaoke rooms and gym but its only for club members so sadly…",5
Anniversary ,Kok Huan,"Booked the anniversaries in the park package to celebrate our wedding anniversary, because we held our wedding there.   The main bugbear was the dinner for 2 @ the salon, which was included in the package.  The restaurant staff seemed to be quite unprepared for us, even though I had corresponded with the reservation staff on the dinner when making the booking about 1.5 months prior to our anniversary.   The staff gave us a choice of a seat, kind of squashed beside the wall, neighboring another couple. The other choice was beside the glass door leading to the outdoor area.  We chose to sit beside the glass door. It was kind of a mistake, because the waiting staff used the glass door for their service. So the glass door kept opening & closing during our meal, & hot air came in.  …",3
Excellent Event Organisation and Stay,Manny,"Thanks to all the staff in HFC for a well run event for my company. The rooms, venue and overall experience from participants around the world was first class! Staff were very accomodating and ensured every detail of our event was attended to. Great rooms and great location.",5
Great location of historical significance,Adelle58,"This former military building has been converted into a lovely hotel in a very quite park in the centre of Singapore.  The rooms are spacious and clean, the only down side would be the location of the bathroom, which is on the window - literally, which means that you need to close the curtains when you’re using the washroom which makes the rest of the rooms quite dark.  Otherwise service, food at breakfast and poolside was good.  We would return.",4
Couples staycation,SayYang,"Lovely weekend staycation with my spouse. Things that we love: 1. Surrounded by much lush greenery, and open lawn spaces. Felt we were faraway from the city. 2. Boutique hotel- only 86 rooms, so felt we had much of the swimming pool to ourselves (and there were 2 adult and 1 kiddie pools) 3. Standard deluxe room was nicely done up, marble flooring of the bathroom gave a very luxurious feel.",5
Solid but small details lacking,Ang W,"There’s nothing bad about this place really. The service is genuine and warm. they recalled my previous stay, tried to check me in early, changed rooms upon request, and offered to store my cake in a freezer in the interim. Hotel location is about ten min from Dhoby Ghaut train station. Room is modern with good tech, and nicely acquainted (albeit small). But it’s the details that are lacking - the window blinds for external facing windows are fully opaque (no partially opaque second layer to allow light while minimising visibility). no bathrobes. table side lamp broke and dangling. evening canapés had a very small selection, were not regularly topped up, and was hosted in a very small sitting area (it was thus overcrowded). Brut and even wine glasses ran out early and were not…",4
HISTORIC BUILDING BEAUTIFULLY MAINTAINED,755anne,Hotel was a lovely historic building with only 85 rooms. It has been very well restored retaining a lot of the historic features.   The location in the middle of the park is great for evening and morning walks. Fort Canning park has a lot of interesting nooks to explore.  and is close enough to Clark Quay to walk. Staff were very helpful and because of the size of the hotel were able to remember who you were.  Happy house for house guests was a nice touch,5
Last 2 nights in Singapore.,Lisa D,"What a magnificent place to stay! Such a relaxed & welcoming atmosphere. Surrounded by a wonderful park full of sights & history.  All the facilities are top class. Staff were always helpful, even when we stayed for hours after our check out time. Would highly recommend to all of our friends and family to stay here when coming to Singapore.",5
Stopover to Europe,Steve Foley,"Ok hotel. Nicely appointed and Fort Canning is a less visted area well worth the effort to visit. Room layout a bit odd and privacy is compromised with a view to creating smaller rooms. Little things like no robe, ran out of toilet paper and main telephone not working detracted from a five star experience. Staff were willing.",3
Can to see our daughter ,Steve W,"First class, old school hotel, ideal for  couples and those wanting an old fashioned high quality break. Fort Canning park is a sanctuary is the huddle and bustle of Singapore. A must if you like history",5
Beautiful hotel and charming staff.,Carmel H,We arrived late afternoon after a long flight from London and were warmly greeted by Kelson. Our beautiful room was ready and we were able to shower and head down to the private sitting area for drinks and canapés followed by a delicious dinner in the hotel restaurant. A very positive experience for our 3 night stay.,5
Quiet oasis,Compradore,"Colonial style living in HFC is guaranteed, the luxury is unobstrusive and comfortable. One exception though I have to point out: the space for the toilet in my room was so narrow, that the sliding glass door had to remain open during use. Travelling as single that is just ok, but for a couple is not tolerable.",4
Birthday Staycation @ Hotel Fort Canning,SY Foo,"It was my first staycation experience and I thoroughly loved the experience. Being a lover of nature n solitude, I am blessed with all.  From the moment, I checked in, I feel at home and kindly treated by the concierge. I received my birthday cake and a card signed by the staff.   The room was simply a delight. The only thing that bugged me was my stay was too short. Haven’t enjoyed the room enough. An excellent space for my quiet time. The bathroom was lovely too!  This certainly will not be my last as I plan to schedule a longer stay the next time.  A big thank you to all the staff who made my stay so memorable.",5
A wonderful hidden gem in the middle of Singapore,Justine F,"We absolutely loved this hotel. So lovely and clean, our deluxe room was large and the service we received was incredible. Everything was perfect from the moment we got out of our taxi, a special thank you to our wonderful team member Kelson who checked us in - he was absolutely amazing!!",5
"Comfortable stay, but far away",Zeninca,Good hotel with good amenities. Not very good accessibility . The nearest metro station is atleast a 10 minute walk. And it’s a steep uphill climb on the way back to the hotel. Not feasible if you’re travelling with elderly parents ( like we were ) or small children unless you’re willing to spend on taxis (very expensive ).  The breakfast spread was lovely and met the standards. The view is nothing to boast about. But evenings are nice and quiet and good for short walks around the campus.  Overall a good hotel but I wish it were closer to the MTR/bus stop or the hotel had offered complimentary buggie rides up and down the hill . Given a choice I would opt for a hotel with a better location.  That’s why I give it 3/5 .,3
Fantastic place in Singapore,792PressJ,"Hotel Fort Canning is a wonderful place with a restful and quiet environment within a beautiful park. Staff are so attentive and helpful. Room was lovely and comfortable, everything we needed . Enjoyed a great breakfast and swimming in fantastic pools . Hotel is close to all amenities , eg walk to museums and shops / restaurants . Station for underground is 5 min walk. Great - will stay here again .",5
Home away from Home,Scottandcraig,"What an elegant hotel. Situation central Singapore, this hotel offers the comforts of home. Set amongst the beautiful park in central Singapore, this hotel offers peace and tranquillity, away from the hustle and bustle.  We were so fortunate to spend 6 nights at this hotel, and we would stay there again.   The staff are exceptional, we particularly found Vinash extremely welcoming hospitable and personable.  We would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful hotel.",5
Pleasant location: central but secluded ,Roseglobe,"Very peculiar location, in a central area of Singapore, between Orchard Road and Marina Bay but immersed in a park and part of a heritage site. Comfortable, large and silent rooms with full service and hospitable and amiable reception. Wide range of breakfast offer, pool, spa, gym. Definitely enjoyable.",5
A good experience,Felicia,"I’ve always wanted to stay at Hotel Fort Canning after seeing so many beautiful photos of the hotel. The colonial style building is really beautiful and well maintained. Check in was very personal and efficient. The room was quite small but had a nice decor. The toilet was spacious with a nice bath tub. Breakfast was alright - not a huge variety but passable. One thing though, maybe it’s the building being quite old, the rooms were not very sound proof. You could hear your neighbours shutting their doors all the time. Overall it was a nice stay, just that if you don’t drive, it isn’t easy to get there. Lots of steps to climb to get to the hotel by public transport.",4
Calm oasis!,Margaret M,"We have just spent four days here at the start of our trip to the Far East. As other reviewers have pointed out, it’s not too far from the main attractions (though we mainly used taxis are we are quite jet-lagged!), yet it is so peaceful up here. The room is very comfortable, though not too private as we were above the main entrance, and had to close the blinds whenever we were in the room as there is a public path facing the room! One thing we weren’t aware of is how hilly the park is, so paths are steep, and there are lots of stairs, which was exhausting in the hot, humid weather. The reception staff were absolutely excellent, and nothing was too much bother for them, and we particularly enjoyed the free wine and canapés between six and seven every evening.....something you…",4
Quiet retreat in the center of the buzzling city,Richard,"we like to return to this place. it's not the usual anonymous huge hotel chain, the staff spend the extra effort, the room design in this old colonial building is really attractive, and the quiet location in close proximity to all downtown places is priceless.",5
the number one hotel in Singapore,Frankyuen0709,The best hotel with very cozy environment & deluxe furnishing room. Staffs are nice & very helpful at all time. This give me an unforgettable hotel living experience in Singapore. Definitely will choose to live in Fort Canning hotel next time. Really appreciate that. Thanks,5
"Wonderful Staff, Beautiful Location",M&K,"We stayed here for a one-night stop over enroute from London to New Zealand. We arrived long before the normal time to check in. The staff did their best to both make us comfortable while we waited, and provided us with an early checkin (much earlier than we might reasonably expected). We had a late flight out, and again - they granted a late checkout, as well as ongoing access to hotel facilities (pool, showers etc.).  The lcoation of the hotel is delightful, as is it's charm.  A walk around this historic site is both interesting, and educational - given the role of this location on Singapore's history.  Highly recommended.",5
AVOID - This is NOT a 5 start hotel,WGF,"The website reads ""Hotel Fort Canning is an iconic 5-star luxury heritage boutique hotel in Singapore.

Relax in Singapore,Liz Davies,Hotel Fort Canning had a sense of tranquility in a very busy city. The regular happy hours introduced us to fellow travelers and we had many a good laugh. The service was impeccable both with the standard of the room service and restaurants as the staff remembered the way I like my coffee and the tea my husband had.  The pool was set in a lush garden setting and floating in the water was very relaxing after a busy day. A great experience overall,5

Fort Canning Hotel a hidden treasure,Belinda I,Thoroughly enjoyed our recent visit to Singapore. Stayed at Fort Canning Hotel for 3 nights. At first I thought it was a bit out of the way but although it is located in beautiful parkland it is surprisingly central. The hotel service was excellent and very personal. Highly recommend.,5
Singapore stopover 2019,272garryj,"Whilst seemingly a little out of the way (being atop a hill) the hotel was quiet and being surrounded by park and was like an oasis in the teeming city of Singapore. Once oriented, it was simple to walk down to the main areas. Hot weather and after extended walks, a reasonable taxi ride back was worthwhile. Happy hour was enjoyed by many guests.",5
Staycation at Hotel Fort Canning,Roy Soh,"Big and clean room, with ensuite bathtub.  Pleasant stay with excellent customer service.  Has a good spread of breakfast selection, with the choice of freshly prepared eggs, pancakes as well as roti prata (which is out of the norm).",5
Tranquil Singapore luxury,philip r,Stayed two nights. Excellent value. Restful hotel vibe allowed me to catch up on work and prepare for meetings.    Internet excellent. Staff friendly and helpful.  Breakfast espresso could be improved.  Will stay again.  Loved the building’s history.,5
Elegant Room,Rohanna I,"Personally I love old building and this hotel meet my standard.  Though location is not at the advantage, perhaps Management to consider having a shuttle to the nearby shopping site.  You have the feeling of the colonial era, there is also a short distance to the park where you can do jogging in the morning or evening. The staffs are also excellent in delivering the service.  Thank you",4
Top notch accommodations,Soyoung M,"This was our first time at Hotel Fort Canning, and it exceeded our expectations!  Booking through the website was easy, and when we needed to make an upgrade prior to our arrival, the staff was efficient and eager to help.  Once we arrived, we had no idea how stunning the location is right next to Fort Canning Park. We felt that we were in an oasis inside bustling Singapore.  The staff was able to accommodate an early check-in, and while we waited we had a delicious meal at the bar.  We were personally shown to our room, where our bags were already waiting. There is happy hour every evening at 6pm with Prosecco, wine and appetizers.  The rooms were impeccably clean, well-appointed, with views of Fort Canning Park.

Contented Staycation,Candy Y,"Birthday staycation for my Mister over the weekends, and we love every hour spent there. This even started from the splendid hospitality given over email correspondence with Ms Maggie on reservation and room service arrangement.  Checked in to highest level, corner room with city view. Despite the wedding conducted right below our room, the noise level was bearable and it ended before 11.30pm. Fabulous high ceiling room with user-friendly room controls, sufficient tv channels and generous amount of TWGs & nespresso capsule. Aircon was slightly weak though.   Love the spacious toilet where tub and shower are separated. However, marble flooring and just 1 floor mat made prone to slips. Water easily flow out of the shower, but that might be just us. Basic toiletries provided. Weak…",4

One of my favorite hotels in Singapore,Brian C,"One of the best and most beautiful hotels I ever stayed at in Singapore. Luxurious, elegant and classy. It's magnificently restored and wonderfully maintained.   Service is impeccable and the rooms are very streamlined with touch control buttons to power everything. Nespresso machines and capsules provided as well as TWG Teas.  The bathroom is amazing with marble bathtub and separate rainshower.  The hotel is also beside the Fort Canning Park so a nice stroll either in the morning or afternoon is perfect.",5
A sliver of paradise in the middle of the city,taylor t,"Our room was spacious and nicely decorated.  Love the floor to ceiling windows and the sitting room.  The hotel is close to multiple metro stations, so it is a good base.  The hotel is more or less in a park which allows for nice long evening walks. ",4
We have found our place to return to,Thelliel,"We really liked the idea of staying in a low set former British building in the Colonial District, set amongst the parkland.  We were not disappointed.  We have fallen in love with Singapore.  The Singaporeans are very helpful, very polite and very house proud of their Island.  These qualities were found in abundance at HFC.  We stayed in a delux room on the second floor with breakfast included and we also had Dinner in their Salon restaurant, twice.  We liked everything about this hotel and its location and it will be our future choice to stay here.  Walk, catch a Taxi or get an Ezi Pass to use nearby MRT trains.",5
Romantic and luxurious ,Alexis C,"My husband and I got married at HFC and spent our wedding night there. Our stay was so comfortable and enjoyable. Elegant decor, comfortable and luxurious. The staff were so polite and professional, everyone treated so nicely. Breakfast was delicious (try the eggs Benedict from the eggs station!) with a mixture of both Asian and western options. We did not manage to take a swim but the pool is chlorine free and filled with mineral water, which sounds great and non-hair-damaging. Beautiful heritage hotel in a site of historical importance. A very classy establishment that I would recommend to everyone. Thank you so much for starting our married life off with such warm hospitality and wonderful service!",5
"Mixed Feelings, Typical City Hotel Lacking Intimacy",DCMIT1,"Stayed at HFC for 3 nights before heading to Ubud and Sanur in Bali having not previously visited Sinapore but having stayed in a number of other countries and cities in Asia.  Arrived at HFC around 9am having previously emailed hotel for an early check-in for our two premiums rooms to be told they were fully booked the night before and therefore unlikely, but we still felt optimistic they might be able to arrange something on the day. Walked in to reception after ~20 hours travelling to find a single receptionist somewhat stressed and clearly stretched.

Orchard, Dobhy Gaut and the clubbing and night time happenings district ie. Clarke Quay. This is how unique the Hotel Fort Canning is. My husband had picked this place due to the wonderful, responsive service he had received from the staff while planning for a birthday surprise for me. I was touched by the birthday cake slice and candle provided by the management, together with its other surprises it had.

Elegant Five Star Hotel,donSeoul_SouthKorea,"Hotel Fort Canning is an elegant hotel in the middle of downtown Singapore but situated within Fort Canning Park permitting a rare combination of convenience and relaxation. The hotel is appropriately sized, neither large nor small.  Rooms are non-traditionally designed which can cut both ways but I found it fine.  The room isn't particularly well-appointed but bot lacking either.  The mini-bar could be improved significantly. Overall, a great hotel worthy of its price.",5

Beautiful & Tranquil,Alice S,"Had a great three night stay at Hotel Fort Canning in September 2019 and we have no hesitation in recommending it.  We are regular travellers to Singapore who usually stay in the Orchard or Marina Bay areas. We chose this hotel for a change because it is surrounded by parkland. The Fort Canning park location didn’t disappoint, it is a very tranquil location and the big windows in our premium room’s study and bathroom looked out onto a wall of green. Both the room and the grounds are beautifully kept and aesthetically pleasing. The front office staff / managers are very helpful & efficient, nothing was too difficult, thank you especially to Kelson Yeo.

Carrie was most helpful when it comes to my impromptu requests and questions!   Of course, on the day of the wedding itself, i was introduced to the best banquet manager, Alvin, who helped to coordinate and and made the event go as smoothly as possible. He was constantly checking in to see if there was anything he could help with and advised me along the way (it's my first time getting married after all!).

Nice stay,Nat S,"Stayed on a work trip. Service was excellent and professional, and the room was nice and modern. The meals were good. Bed was not so comfortable. Due to the hotel's location you have to wait a bit for a taxi to pick you up, but it doesn't take long. Did not have a chance to use the 2 pools but they were not busy when I checked them out.",4
Calm in a busy sticky city,727Beachlover,Located in the park this beautiful colonial building is like an oasis. Love that you can open the windows and get air. Great to be able to walk around the grounds/garden/park. So refreshing rather than a high rise hotel. Also loved the swimming pool (there are 2).  Down side - was the super strong smell in the lobby - way too much perfume. I had to wait outside. We arrived early and the team offered us access to the spa for a shower while we waited. Nice gesture (but the spa was very tired and the showers need a re furb).,5
Short family stay,Sudip Ghosh (Prof),Very unique boutique hotel. Modern rooms with good size. Bed comfortable but pillows need work.

Absolutely lovely! Definitely coming back,Sarah B,"Check-in was painless and quick after a bumpy flight in. Front desk staff were very professional. The room was absolutely gorgeous, definitely 5 stars. My son loved the remote control for the blinds and lights. The pool was beautiful with very pretty day beds - close to Bugis, Fort Canning and many other key areas in Singapore. The washroom is just heaven with a big soaker tub and relaxing view of palm trees. ",5
Business Trip,sail0r2017,"Building, interior, lobby, rooms are very nice. Hotel staff is very friendly. Used the two pools, which was a bit noisy due to construction works all day. Breakfast is ok, however could offer a bit more variety. Coffee out of machine, served to tables was not good. I switched to chocolate.",4
Beautiful hotel with excellent customer service ,I-Wee T,"Heritage, good location, calm and peaceful stay with the greeneries. This is my 2nd stay in this beautiful hotel. I had requested for early check in and the front desk staff made it happen by upgrading my room with no additional charge. The room design and layout are gorgeous and perfect. Big and clean. Not to mention, the top notch of customer service provided.  Will definitely be my option again. ",5
Weekend Staycation at Hotel Fort Canning,Wei Lun,"I'm definitely giving 5 stars to Hotel Fort Canning's customer service. Vinash have provided exceptional customer service by ensuring my stay is perfect. From my early check in request to my arrival and my small request, he ensured that everything is well prepared for. Highly recommended. View from the room is great too!",5
Wonderful experience at HFC,EUGENEFCS,"The moment I step into the hotel compound, it totally gives a picturesque feel, every staff that I interact with, is well presented and courteous. Especially this two staffs which really caught my attention. the front lobby desk officer. Kelson Yeo, who’s very detail oriented. And the bar counter, Chris Toh. chirpy and willing to share wine knowledge to someone like me who knows the basics.  Totally enjoy every moment of my time spend in this hotel. Cheers",5
My ROM prep day & staycation,Karthig E,Stayed in the suite for 2 nights and it was an awesome place and room. Spacious with a small balcony. Had more than enough space for my fiance to get ready for our ROM. The staffs were all friendly and nice. Top service and special recognition for Vinesh who assisted magnificently with all our requests and also made our stay way better as well. ,5
Excellent Hotel - Highly Recommended,Simon JGH,"Great hotel, nice swimming pool, excellent location in the beautiful Fort Canning Park but most importantly top level service - Thank to Chris Toh at the bar I was kept well hydrated, well advised and well looked after. Thanks Chris!",5
Love this place!,tjh21,"Highly recommend this hotel! Unique location - but still close to everything, beautiful rooms, 2 lovely pools, restaurants with great food if you don’t feel like venturing out and the team are amazing. Very friendly and helpful!  We booked a garden room and had the package including breakfast and evening drinks with canapés.  We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend!",5
Top hospitality!!,Ami + Ndr,"we stayed here during my husband's birthday cum the long national day weekend. i requested for a small slice of cake and was prepared to pay for it but instead, we got it FOC. they were busy due to full occupancy but service was not compromised at all! my check in/ out, room service was super quick. breakfast buffet is not halal certified so we just ate other things like toast/ cereal etc. coffee was great! we love the pool too, we had a night swim and it was so relaxing and peaceful. All in all, it was definitely a great relaxing stay. thanks kelson for the amazing hospitality!",5
"Tranquil, lux and different",ArghONaught,"The only things I could write negative are the quirky bathrooms (but that depends on who you are traveling with and your relationship, a few variations of the floorplan range from quirky to romantic, but nowhere to hang damp towels to dry in the one we stayed in) and that depending which way you walk to the hotel and you probably will, you can encounter 90-120 steps, or part way up escalators when coming from Clarke Quay direction.  The location is marvelous.  The staff are brilliantly professional and very helpful.   It is not a place for those who love 5-star international properties with hundreds of rooms and commensurate facilities - this is low key not in your face boutique style.  I would return anytime.",5
Loved the pools but breakfast needs improvement,tirelesstraveller204,"We stayed here 3 nights on our way back home to Sydney following our European holiday. I chose HFC because of the green surrounds and to get some respite from the hustle and bustle of this hectic metropolis.  Our Premium Luxe room was spacious and had a large enclosed  verandah area which unfortunately was wasted space because it is furnished with just one large chair and a small table. Bad luck if both of us wanted to sit out there, we would need to take turns! There was room for at least another chair, coffee table and even a small dining table and chairs so not sure why it was so sparsely furnished.  I loved the large mineral water pools (no smell of chlorine) and the pool area was very nice being surrounded by huge trees. We even spotted a cute little squirrel one day. Lying…",4
Mini getaway to celebrate my husbands birthday.,Lynn M,"Mini getaway to celebrate my husbands birthday, whilst visiting family in Singapore. We highly recommend everything about this hotel. And particularly liked the rooms, pools, the park gardens and the complimentary drinks before dinner.  The food was excellent too.  And you are a lovely walk from lots of places.",5
OK stay but it could be so much more,Heidi B,"Hotel Fort Canning would have so much going for itself. Great history, good location, superb surroundings and interesting building.  Unfortunately the hotel seems a little run down and tacky. The rooms are weirdly decorated and arranged. You cannot be on the toilet without rolling down the shades IN YOUR OWN room. I also discovered that you actually also can be seen from a neighbouring room when on toilet (WTFFF??). However, that probably does not apply to most rooms.  Staff is friendly and helpful. That is great.  Pool area is below average. No pool service unless you get up and call a staff member from a phone booth. No matrasses for the sun beds.  Breakfast buffet is OK and varies daily but nothing fantastic.  All in all: not a bad experience but also not what I looked for.…",3
Lots of greenery,Chee Kin L,"I only stayed one night at HFC and I chose the room with the patio. It was a beautiful experience, like opening up to your little private garden right at your doorstep. My overall experience was great as the hotel is beautiful and grand with very friendly staff. Although I was told that the check in time was 2pm, the front desk called me and informed me that I can check in around 1130 as the room was vacant and ready. Really appreciate this kind gesture. The doors to the garden needed some minor repair and there was a slight tear on the bed sheet. But besides these minor negatives, I had a wonderful experience at HFC, will definitely go back again for a longer stay.",4
HFC Staycation,Eric G,"The room was fantastic. I checked in on 10th August. I would also like to commend on the following staffs 1) Abigal, who helped us checked in, was very professional. She also went out of her way to fulfill our request to view the other rooms for our reference in the future. 2) Jonathan who served us in The Salon Restaurant. He did mention to us that he is not from the restaurant and just helping for the day. He is definitely one of the best service staff I have encountered, with his concise recommendations, explanations and friendly service. It really give us a positive and wonderful start to our HFC experience",5
Enjoyable hotel,Cheryl S,"This hotel is the old fort building. It has been renovated and is quite pleasant. We were happy with our room. There was a slightly musty smell every time we entered the room. The staff are great. Very friendly and helpful. Every night there is happy our in the lobby where guests can mingle and relax before their evening starts. Free Prosecco, red and whit wine and canapés. This was fun and enjoyable. The hotel is set on the top of a hill inbeautiful lush gardens. As such there are no passing taxis to hail, so unless you walk down the hill, you need to book a taxi. The hotel is within walking distance to Orchard Street.",4
A Relaxing Week,Dave K,"This an excellent hotel in a great central location that makes it very easy to explore Singapore by car or foot, and the location in Fort Canning Park adds a whole other level in regards to relaxation.",5
Celebration of Singapore 54th Birthday!,Chia Kok Koon,"Hi HFC Team,  It was a very memorable stayed and celebration! My wife and I have been staying at HFC 4 times... just stayed 9 Aug to 12 Aug.

Unforgettable Stay,Adi Meowls,"It is one of the unforgettable stayed I've encountered throughout a few staycays in Singapore.. Even though this was my first experience here, it was breathtaking.. The service, room, breakfast and the whole environment is one in a million..",5
Wonderful Experience,angeseb,"This is our second time in Singapore. My husband comes over for business so I tag along. Last time I visited I did the Battle Box tour in Fort Canning and came across this hotel.....looked lovely and so did a bit of research online, saw that it got excellent reviews and so this had to be our hotel for my husband's next business trip. What I loved about the hotel was that it was always peaceful and never crowded and the staff was friendly, courteous and extremely helpful. The position is great because even though the hotel is situated in a park you are within walking distance of  Clarke Quay.  Fort Canning and Dhoby Ghaut mrt stations are close by. Unusual rooms with bathrooms towards the end of the room as if on a balcony! I would definitely recommend the Fort Canning Hotel and…",5
My favorite hotel in Singapore ,OsloTim,"I previously used this hotel for Business trips to Singapore, so when we planned a family vacation to Singapore it was the obvious place to stay.  There is a majestic feel about this old colonial building. Set in the beautiful fort canning park, the surroundings add to the relaxation.  2 Great pools which the kids spent hours enjoying, such friendly staff and a breakfast buffet which will set up any traveler for a day of exploring.  Excellent modern rooms, perfect WiFi connectivity and guest drinks and canapés in the evening a must.",5
"Brilliant, welcoming and relaxing",Voyager448768,We had a fabulous 4 night stay at the Fort Canning and could not fault it in anyway. Beautiful setting and fantastic attentive employees.   The breakfast was very enjoyable as were the evening welcome drinks. We will definitely stay here again.,5
Excellent service peaceful location,JudiAMc,Loved our stay at fort canning hotel for nine nights.  Excellent friendly service from all the staff. The hotel is situated in fort canning park which is very beautiful and very peaceful location. Well appointed hotel extremely comfortable. Enjoyed our stay very much.,5
"Wow, great hotel !",lovetotravel10140,"my husband and I stayed here for 2 nights after a very long flight from Europe. This hotel is truly relaxing. The decore is gorgeous. The room we were given on Level 3 was beautiful. Breakfast was delicious and we had dinner there one night and it was also very delicious. The 2 pools are huge and really allows you to just chill and relax, exactly what we were looking for. Thank you Hotel Fort Canning..we will always book this place every time we are lucky enough to visit wonderful Singapore.. Ps/ Thank you to ALL the staff, they were very , vey friendly and nice.",5
"Looks wonderful, even if only for a drink in the bar!",gourmetflaneur,"This place has an historic location and it was worth the detour to look inside and enjoy the grounds and have a drink in the bar.  It is cool, quiet, classy. Next time I should like to stay here!  The historic fort is immediately behind and in fornt the park leads to many of the great Singapore tourist venues.",5
"Boutique hotel, surrounded by trees, great service",Caroline B,We were recommended this hotel by a friend and very happy that we decided to stay there. It is a heritage building that has been tastefully converted so that it has all the usual facilities without losing all the character. The rooms were spacious and the bathroom located towards the front of the room was a novelty. The breakfast was adequate. The service was good from all members of staff. The pool was warm and not too busy. It felt like an exclusive resort. The biggest downside was that taxidrivers were not familiar with it and it was a hike up the hill from the MTR until we discovered the escalators up from the Fort Canning station which made it a lot easier.,5
Great stay in heritage hotel,Vicky T,"Impressed with front desk staff and restaurant staff. Good sized room, nice bathroom. Close to Dhoby Gant MRT & Clarke Quay. Tasty food for dinner, breakfast was of good standard. Two swimming pools. A couple of issues with room lighting both were attended to promptly",5
Quiet Spot in a busy town,Rolf O,"Hotel Fort Canning is a quiet, awesome and elegant place in Singapur. In a green garden but close to important spots like Singapore River, National Museum, Orchard Road and Metro-Stations like Dhoby Ghaut. From there five minutes to Marina Bay, Little India and China Town. Two nice, great pools. Nice rooms, good breakfast. Every day from 6 to 7pm free wine and Prosecco for houseguests.",4
Staycation (Deluxe room),MYap,"Great accommodation, very large bed and exquisite architecture. Breakfast was excellent as well. Accessible to the city centre albeit on a hilltop, with quiet surroundings. One gripe I had was the TV was not configurable; you’re forced to watch their channels and you can’t use Airplay or HDMI for your Netflix/Hulu/etc.",4
Lovely hotel but very noisy rooms. Don’t recommend.,archietait,"HFC is a lovely hotel on a beautiful hill close to the city center. However the air conditioning on the second level premium rooms are very old and very noisy/loud even when set to low. Secondly the apartment doors don’t offer any sound protection from the main hallway so when other doors in the hotel open / close or there are conversations in the hallway, these are very loud and can be heard in your room. The staff are lovely and the restaurant is great, but unfortunately the rooms are so noisy at night we would of preferred to stayed somewhere else.  ",2
Heart of Singapore ,Karey L-H,"Hotel Fort Canning is on very pleasant hill not far from Clarke Quay. It’s very well decorated, very clean and comfortable and the staff are really friendly and helpful. We had a problem with a light in our room and they moved us to a different room very quickly. Breakfast was not included and seemed rather expensive so we ate out. The swimming pools, however, were lovely and the bed really comfortable. ",5
Room 220 is amazing,Johnny,I was only there for one night and could have stayed in the room the whole time because the room was so comfortable and spacious. The high tech control panel including electric blinds were a pleasure to operate especially while lying in bed.,5
1 night stay with family,Joms,The place is beautiful and peaceful. My children enjoy a lot and want to come back soon. Recommended very much. Great staff and good food. Will definitely come back and try to book for 3 days with family again..👍🏻😜🙂,5
Stayed before and will come again ,Nick W,"This is a lovely place.   Tranquil surrounds in Fort Canning Park. Stylish colonial building.   The staff are friendly and efficient. I like the fact that they always stand to greet you when you approach the reception desk.    They have two swimming pools, both set in lush gardens.   It’s a little out of downtown but taxis are so cheap and efficient here that it doesn’t matter. ",5
My honest review,Angelinesumardy,Its really comfortable place to live. The people are so kind and helpful. Their room are so clean and tidy as well . What I like the most was the atmosphere and how comfortable I am when I arrived at the room. Good service :) ,5
"Charming,  comfortable and welcoming",K B,"We thoroughly enjoyed our family ve night stay last week. We had booked over 5 months ago and took advantage of a special deal staying in a premier room. The room was so spacious and well laid out. The bed was very comfortable and the automated lights, curtains and air con were easy to use. The two pools were a lovely respite after a day sightseeing and the evening drinks and canapés were an excellent way to learn what other travellers had enjoyed seeing and doing. Our tip is to walk around the garden’s top path early in your stay to get your bearings. Dhauby Guat is the easiest MRT station to use as it is on two main lines. Take the time to locate the underpass near the hotel which brings you out just across from the bus interchange and exit B, this is a much more comfortable…",5
Very very disappointed ,Karen C,My son and his friend booked to stay here for two nights in their stop off to Fiji and were REFUSED to stay in a room they had paid for because they are 17 years old. This was very upsetting for them in a strange country being ejected from the hotel and as parents very distressing that our teenagers had booked ahead and been proactive only to be left in the street with nowhere to stay . Also they WERE NOT refunded meaning we had to send they extra money to find alternative accommodation. If they do not allow u sees 18’s that should have been a stipulation if booking they happily took their money and refused the service they paid for and didn’t refund. FURIOUS ,1
Luxurious accommodation,cheillalala,"Check in was pleasant, the staff was very friendly, helpful, and informative. He informed us that there's a free flow of wine & canapes at the lobby everyday from 6-7PM. Didn't get the chance to visit though. Room was very spacious and luxurious indeed with marble floor. Love the bathroom setting! Bathtub was very big. I notice the bed was bigger than standard king size bed as well. Breakfast was just okay. Very limited choices for a 5 star hotel. Spent about 80ish singapore dollar for 2 pax breakfast. We ordered grabfood the next day instead for breakfast. Location was at the heart of the city, even though we didn't get to stroll around the park or go anywhere else.  Overall, a very good experience!",5
Style and location,Geoff B,"What more could you want?  A lovely hotel surrounded by gardens, and within easy walking distance of two MRT stations (Dhoby Ghaut, Fort Canning), a shopping complex (Plaza Singapura) and Singapore River (Clarke and Robertson Quays).  The National Museum of Singapore is also right next door.  Our room, a single space on the ground-floor with its own courtyard and garden, was well appointed and equipped - exemplified by a large bath.  The only knock - the toilet and shower opened directly onto the living area/bedroom.  This may not worry some.  There are only two floors of rooms, and it seems that the upper rooms have a view.  Staff at the hotel were very friendly and obliging; nothing was too much trouble.  Thank you to the reception staff and Julian, in particular.  The hotel…",5
Conference and Vacation,Greg Martin,"The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was very comfortable and clean. They really provided five-star service. Since breakfast is included with the room (nice feature!), they charge $25 per day for double occupancy. I'm not sure the breakfast was worth the $25 charge, but it was good and there was great variety on the buffet. In the end, $25 per day feels a little steep when you are staying for a week. The major negative is that it's about a five to ten minute walk to the MRT station. It may not sound like much, but in the heat of Singapore, you'd work up a sweat walking to the MRT. The walk back (up hill) felt like scaling Everest after a long day of site-seeing. I'm in my 40s and am in good shape. If you have health problems or can't walk long distances then…",5
Singapore hidden gem,Mike M,Fantastic staff who greeted me very late at night when I walked in the door. Also great spa staff. Great room as well. 10/10 all around for this experience for sure. I also stayed at the Fairmont and would actually prefer this hotel over that one. It’s quaint and classy without your bigger hotel commercial feel.,5
Faboulous Stay Ever,sylvia k,"I really love every thing about this hotel, especially their interior and exterior and of course their awesome services, this hotel is very close to fortcanning park, you can have a great picture there(instagramble), and also near to MRT.  Yeah,need to noted that they every 6pmat their lobby will have wine and champagne free flow for all hotel guess, this is so special.   Last time i took 2 night with breakfast they have a great Breakfast, you can order their special menu at the bar there.  I had Tea Time too , it's so great , i love it   For me this is the best hotel in Singapore, Very Recommended, Best stay ever ❤❤❤  ",5
Outstanding hotel worth 6 star rating,Kerry S,"I write this review as I sit outside in my little patio attached to my room. This is my second visit to this hotel and it meets my needs perfectly when travelling to Singapore for work. The location is perfect as I like to run in the park and be away from the crowds. All of the staff are exceptionally polite and so helpful. The rooms are perfectly clean and spacious. The breakfast is of high quality and restaurant evening meals very good. I enjoyed the free evening drinks (when I wasn’t working) as it provided a good opportunity to meet others. The 2 pools are terrific, especially the lap pool and the gym outstanding with excellent, new equipment. I can not fault this hotel and it comes with the highest recommendation. The building and grounds are beautiful. I was able to walk…",5
Amazing service! Beautiful hotel!,Ashley H,"Kelvin was absolutely stellar! He (and other staff) were so friendly and attentive.

And the special part is every 6pm they provide free flow wine and dessert for all the guests at the Lobby 🤗  This hotel located in a perfect area, close to the MRT station , will always be my favorite hotel and will staying there every time i come to Singapore ! 👍🏻😆",5
I Highly Recommend Staying Here,Hayden,"Very clean rooms, very big rooms, polite staff, beautiful location, quiet, and a historical site set in a giant park, its one of the most important places in all of Singapore due to its strategic location during WW2 and was used as a British military site, and its a great place to unwind after going around the busy city. Its a very unique and elegant hotel. I really loved staying here. I have nothing bad to say about any aspect of my experience there. The location is just awesome you can walk comfortably to many of the museum, shops, and restaurants. I will stay here anytime I'm in Singapore!",5
In the Park above the city,Doris G,"Nice Heritage hotel, beautiful rooms, in the Park above the City. If you do not mind to walk up, perfect location. Very nice Pool with modern Outdoor furniture, unfortunately the cushions are still missing....",4
Singapore Holiday,Mark B,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning in a premium room for 2 nights and had a great experience. The room was clean, spacious, well maintained, and we loved the interior. The hotel itself was beautiful and the location was very central.  The staff were exceptionally kind and helpful throughout our stay, and the breakfast was also delicious, with a good selection at the buffet. We also enjoyed wondering around the surrounding parkland, which was very green and picturesque, and contained some interesting historical sites and structures where we could learn a bit about Singapore’s history. The National Museum being so close was also a bonus.   I would happily recommend this hotel to friends and family.",5
Avoid the weekend wedding frenzy!,JoyFlight101,"We recently stayed again at Hotel Fort Canning, which was originally built as British Army admin centre. This was our fourth stay there and the reason we keep returning is the hotel's setting: it is set back from any busy roads, and is surrounded by a lush green park (Fort Canning Park) on three sides. It's a very pleasant 7 or so minute walk through the park in one direction to reach the Fort Canning metro station, and another 5 minute (albeit less pleasant) walk through nearby streets in the other direction to reach Dhoby Ghaut metro station. Just behind the hotel is the WWII Battle Box, where the British and allied soldiers hunkered down when the Japanese invaded the island. Tours of the bunker take 1.5 hrs and are well worth it. A short stroll down the hill from the hotel…",4
Successful Proposal :-),Darrell L,"With the excellent help of the Hotel Fort Canning staff, I successfully proposed to my girlfriend :-)  Coordination with the Reservations Team went without a hitch, with communications being replied promptly and concisely. They were genuine in helping me make the proposal a perfect one, and I am filled with gratitude for their professionalism and keen sense to details.  The Decorations Team did a beautiful job in the creating a romantic atmosphere for the room, and completed the decorations well within time for the surprise proposal to happen.

A place worth revisiting ",5
Simply a great hotel,Per D,"A last minute change of plans led us to this wonderful hotel with its friendly and courteous staff, it’s great room, and it’s overall classy atmosphere. In addition the location is very nice: a totally up to date standard in a historic building located in a green “lung” (park) of bustling Singapore. Good value for money and highly recommended.  ",5
"As always extremely comfortable, great staff, helpful and a haven",Sally M,"The garden patio rooms are great. the hotel is very comfortable, the staff go out of their way to be helpful and accommodating, the swimming pools are fantastic, and it's great to find a low-rise hotel in Singapore. The complimentary happy hour drinks are generous and a lovely way to meet fellow travellers. Restaurant is good, though some variation in the menu would be good to see over time and between lunch and dinner.",5

The hotel is beautifully situated within the park and is an oasis of serenity. Excellent amenities and attentive staff.  You can't help relax when staying here.

5 Star hotel & Service (Thumbs up) !!!,Swiss Lam,"This hotel is gives you a totally different experience (especially if you read through the history of this building).  With the location near the Fort Canning, a guided trip explain everything.  The front desk staff makes us feel so welcome but not overwhelmed.  It's my son's birthday and he had a little surprise from the hotel!  I'm staying in the Premium Room and there is a separate study room facing Fort Canning.  No doubt, it make the bedroom smaller but this concept is good as kid can watch TV program and I can close the study room's door and have my own time.  What I like best is the bathroom.  Super big, clean and with modern tiles! The bathtub is big and a wide distance separated from the basin. (Giving you a spacious feeling).  One more plus point for this room type. …",5
Relaxing Stay,marki858,"Everything about the stay was very nice. The staff were extremely helpful and made the stay pleasant from checking in to checking out, letting us check out at 1 PM and just said okay promptly with a smile.

Breakfast at the hotel was very nice and the staff helped make the whole experience even better. ",5

A perfect stay-cation destination for couples looking to get away.",5
Hidden Getawawy Gem,Art M,"HFC is tucked away in Fort Canning Park. Within the park itself is mesmerizing beauty with lots to do and see. A lot of walking around the park and sights to admire, as the top of the park overlooks the city. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating always! If you are in for exploration, lots of walking can be done from HFC to the main tourist attractions of Singapore. Absolutely had a blast and there was so much to do. The hotel rooms were beautiful and spacious. Very tech savvy and there was a nice view from the bathroom!",5
good stay,Johnson,"staff were friendly, good service. will definitely come again. left my speaker at the hotel but staff were kind and good enough to inform us of the lost &found item. totally reliable. one of the prettiest toilet i have been to",5
Serene haven,Gembrook,"Loved the location, which is just a short walk (about 1km) away from the hustle and bustle of the Singapore attractions around the Marina Bay area. The hotel itself is set in Parklands just next to the historic Battle box and near the National museum. A MRT station is also only a short walk away, but I did not use that. There is a restaurant on site that does a good pizza and also features a breakfast buffet. As a bonus they had my favourite beer in stock, Erdinger Dunkel :-)",5
Luxury in a garden paradise,Karl G,"The style of the hotel harks back to the luxury of years gone by. But is situated within a short walk of the first class, MRT rail system. The staff are excellent friendly and efficient, NOTHING is to much trouble. The breakfast is something to be seen and sampled. The quality and variety on offer,for all tastes is quite amazing. The attention to detail,and quality of service is first class.  The rooms are airy and well appointed. There are facilities to keep the fitness clientele satisfied,with a well equipped gym, and a moderate pool to cool of in. If your looking for somewhere to celebrate a birthday or any other anniversary this is the place. A very popular event  venue, especially for weddings. This however does not impact in anyway to the attention given to the hotel…",5
Horrendous service at restaurant,Travel the world 123,"Staff were nowhere to be found, service was slow, food came out only after several reminder. Cutlery were dirty.

Nice hotel with a good amenities,CameliaKL,"Very comfortable hotel, with very friendly staff. The room is very nice, spacious and comfortable. It has also excellent location.

Comfortable hotel in a peaceful location,rex b,"Fort Canning Hotel met all our expectations and actually was quite well located close to Orchard Road, Dhoby Ghaut train station and Plaza Singapora. Pleasant ten minute 500 metres walk . Taking the lift down to the basement carpark was a great way to eliminate a steep climb from main street level. Close walkable distance 600 metre to Fort Canning station and Clarke Quay was a real bonus. Rooms were comfortable if not overly large, bathroom offered an outstanding view over Singapore.

Very disappointing,L1saB,"When in Singapore we usually stay around the Bay Area but on this occasion we needed to be close to Orchard Road so chose this hotel over the large chains because it was smaller, was in the park and was a beautiful, old historical building.  Our arrival was the first disappointment as the taxi has to drop guests off at the back of the hotel, which is a narrow passageway with a concrete wall rising up to one side.  We chose a garden room in order to have a patio to sit on and the pictures show several seating options nicely furnished with purple cushions.  Sadly, the cushions were absent so the seats were not particularly comfy; the Bali bed had a mattress but no scatter cushions to prop yourself up with so the only position you could adopt was flat on your back!  At first glance…",2
A very pleasant hotel,Florian,"I had a business trip in Spore with a colleague and we were very satisfied by the hotel : Well located, with spacious and well equipped rooms. The hotel staff is very helpful and lovely. Everything is allright and I recommend warmly this hotel",5
a  blissful stay,april,"a great location - hard to find in a densely populated singapore, it is quiet yet a stone's throw away from the public transport system. near Orchard area - the shoppers' paradise we like the room with high ceiling, vintage bathroom that has a great view of the greenery, very very nice beds that transport one into the lalaland the minute one closes his/her eyes! breakfast buffet is one that we enjoyed so much, the spread, the quality, the healthy version, the taste are all thoughtfully planned for the visitors - what a blast ! the best experience is probably the personal warm touch endowed to us from the very beginning of the booking, right till the end of leaving the hotel - bravo to all hotel staff - whether it is the reservation manager, the chef, service staff, housekeeping…",5
Heritage hotel in beautiful Fort Canning Park.,Ken Tan,"This is a beautiful heritage building in the quiet, beautiful park of Fort Canning.   For travellers who are very familiar with Singapore, this hotel offers something different.   However, for those relatively new to Singapore, I recommend other hotels downtown as this property is not easily accessed via public transport.   I’d have liked to rate this hotel as 5 stars but I found the quality of services to be somewhat lacking. All in all, I’d rate it 4.5 stars.",4
Staycation for birthday,J1859DMwendyl,Had a nice birthday cake served to our room. We enjoyed a complimentary drink at the lounge. Room was clean. Loved the rain shower and the bath tub. Bed was huge n comfortable. 10 min walking distance to Plaza Singapura,5
Wow,Bernadette H,"So this isn’t our usual hotel type but with just two nights in Singapore we wanted a very comfortable bed, access to a gym and pool and somewhere quiet. The hotel was amazing, the staff particularly Saif, were helpful, friendly and made us feel very welcome even if we were there 6 hours before check in time. We couldnt check into our room that early and didn’t expect to be able to. But we were able to have a shower, get changed and store our bags before heading out for a day at the zoo. The room was very stylish and just like it looked in the photos. Bed was huge and comfortable. View from the bathroom impressive, just had to remember to close the curtain so we didn’t ‘impress’ the neighbourhood. Fabulous stay, would definitely come back and stay again. ",5
One of best hotels I've stayed,Helena B,"It had been a long time since one hotel didn't surprise me that much (and I have stayed in many fancy ones)... The hotel is full of history, the staff is totally helpful, the room was modern and classic at the same time. Modern because everything is controlled by a touch screen panel and they provide a smartphone for all guests to use. And classic because the architecture is beautiful and amazing - not only in the rooms, the whole hotel, by the way. And every night they also offer complimentary drinks and finger foods in the lobby. It's not close to go by walking to marina bay, tough, if that's someone's interest... Anyway, what a fantastic experience, hope to come back someday!",5
Quiet and cosy,Jipeval,"Hôtel Fort Canning is at the top of For Canning park and therefore very quiet and removed from the hasdmske  of the city! Staff is very courteous and or room with a patio was very comfortable. The only thing that was odd was the tub in the middle off the room and a sliding door for the toilet/shower that left very little room for privacy! Other than that, the pools were quiet and beautiful, the breakfast buffet was well organised and with different types of food - both Asian and Western. There was a free happy hour every night at 6 pm in the reception area and an small office space where my husband was able to work and place business calls. The bar is very comfy as well. We only had dinner once and it was rather fancy, very good and beautifully presented ($200 though for a soup,…",5
Interesting rooms!,Scottytrip,"Location,quietness, staff, breakfast and bed quality were all suberb, unfortuanately the room (107) was looking a bit tired! The bath was surrounded rectangular raised tiles  making the room very dangerous to walk around day and especially nighttime! Also the toilet and shower were located in the bedroom meaning that any smell and steam generated wern't contained in a room with an extractor fan - what was the designer thinking!",3
Fantastic Stay,barbara hoogedeure,We spent 5 nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and highly recommend this hotel. The location of the hotel in Fort Canning Park is great and makes for a very quiet stay in a busy city. We had an issue on our first night with a noise in our room and once we reported it to the staff they immediately moved us to another room. The staff were all lovely and very accomodating. The rooms are a good size and were very clean with nice outlooks to the park.The location of the hotel is good with Clarke Quay being a short and achievable walk even in the Singapore heat. Overall very happy with our stay.,5
Relax Staycation at Hotel Fort Canning Premium room 😍,Shir_Gracious,"The hotel has a really nice view and nearest park can be so refreshing with the historical places. The room is really good and convenient, really a good rest. The food is also really good, especially the crème brûlée 😋",5
A great hotel ,Marilyn C,"A perfect stay at Hotel Fort Canning was characterised by the exceptional staff. We arrived early morning following a long haul flight to be greeted with the welcome news that our room was already available. Imaginatively retro-fitted, with the large bathroom occupying the balcony, the hotel is supremely comfortable. Its location within Fort Canning Park makes for a peaceful stay. An excellent breakfast was provided.",5
Hotel Fort Canning,Graham M,Beautiful hotel situated in quiet parkland. An oasis of calm yet close to all the Singapore attractions.Rooms are light and fresh with views across park.Drinks on the outside terrace at sunset is an enjoyable experience.,5
Bday Staycation - Hubby Birthday,Wendy Ng,"Warm reception by Kelson at the front desk, who was kind to extend late checkout to 1pm. He was also very attentive to our needs, personally escorting us to the lift and guiding us on how to go to our room,   I like the tranquil ambience in HFC, away from the bustling city ლ(╹◡╹ლ)   Overall an awesome experience except for the rollout bed; sponge foam seem thin and I can feel the metal spring when laying down.",5
A delightful find,JenStuBro,"We loved the location set amongst all the greenery, like a sanctuary away from the busy city below. The staff were really helpful and lovely. The room was a surprise with its high ceilings and massive bathroom windows which provided lovely views and lots of natural light. The room itself was well appointed and more than comfortable. Will definitely return to stay longer.",4
Amazing staff and comfortable!,Shanmeera,room was amazing with great ambience. COMFORTABLE BED. loved the toilet and how unique it was.

Relaxing and friendly staff,Catherine,Variety of food for breakfast was great.  Location to Orchard Road just a short stroll down the hill for retail therapy.  Room very spacious with a bathroom with a view over look city.  Staff are friendly and very helpful.,4
"Beautiful hotel, high tech and quiet.",ChristinaT12345,"Beautiful rooms, helpful and friendly team. Loved the technology (including the cell phone you can take with you, the room control panel), incredibly comfortable bed (and awesome how they have pillows you can choose from), great pools (though wish it was slightly colder since it was so hot outside - almost felt like bathwater). It was a little tricky for some cab drivers to find the front lobby so at times we had to walk - I liked being a little removed in the park (very peaceful and felt out of the city), but it did make it difficult to walk to many places from the hotel. Just something to consider in thining about your goals for the visit. Overall very nice hotel and would definitely recommend!",4
Lovely park setting and good location,Trevor R,"Have stayed here three times, staff always very friendly and helpful, spacious room and bathroom in heritage style, love the quiet and pretty park setting and opportunity for early morning stroll perhaps to Fabulous Baker Boy cafe other side of park.

Perfect retreat for peace and relaxation.,Juiceyjuice,"Had a staycation for a night in the premium room. After checking in, a staff usher us to the room and briefly taught us how to use the controls in the room. Appreciate the lovely services from all the staffs. There's free evening drink and canapé at 6 at the private lounge. In room dinning service is quite fast too. Plaza singapura is just approximately 6 min walk away. Love the whole feel of the room, the park view from the room, marble theme toilet, clean and well furnished room and most importantly it makes us feel relax and peacefulness which makes us feel that the money is well spent. Wish I was given the premium room with the toilet that over look the park (pick  this to enjoy the full perfect garden retreat) but nonetheless, nothing to pick on for this stay.",5
Lovely heritage building in park location,arrietty01,"We had only 24 hours in Singapore and I loved this hotel.  It is in the centre of Singapore but set at the edge of the park so quiet and peaceful.  The rooms were spacious and furnished in a modern but sympathetic to the times style.  Because it is heritage and used to be a government building, there are some quirky things about the spaces.  I loved the bathroom which was set in the closed in balcony of the room.  There was a free drinks happy hour for guests where we met other travellers and we also enjoyed using the free mobile (cell)  phone provided (you could take it out for the day).  We also loved the swimming pool area with views of park trees.  staff were courteous and helpful.  We had a light dinner in the dinning room and breakfast in the morning and both were…",5
Wonderful location and amenities,ardent_adventurers,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for a wedding held at the same location and loved the clean, modern room. The location is ideal, only a short stroll through the beautiful park to reach the Orchard Road shopping district or Clarke Quay. We also loved the outdoor pools which were secluded and well maintained.",5
Beautiful rooms and well equipped gym ,Sher A. Wizeman,"The rooms are beautiful and spacious in this hotel and feature nice modern touches like electronic blinds and a full window in the bathroom. Breakfast is somewhat basic but good enough and while there isn’t a strong service presence, the staff are friendly. Was really impressed with the fully equipped gym which had all sorts of machines and a yoga room! ",4
Truly special,Wayne,"We recently had our wedding in the Lavender Ball Room on March 23. We would like to commend the staff at Hotel Fort Canning, in particular the housekeeping, catering and events team, for showing commitment to their jobs above and beyond what was expected of them. It was truly a sight to see how well-coordinated everyone was, from the moment we checked in the night before, to the event proceedings and to the check-out the next day.   We would also like to specifically thank Adrian, Doris, Jonathan and Jason for helping us to make our wedding experience a smooth and enjoyable one. The rooms were beautifully decorated and arranged; the food was well-prepared and tasted great; and the event was run very systematically. Every concern and request we had were addressed so promptly and…",5
Great Hotel,Bernita S,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for 5 days at the end of March and I must say we were very happy with our choice. Beautiful old building restored to a high grade, comfortable, clean and great staff happy to help at all times. Close to MRT and the Singapura Shopping Centre. Good pool and gym facilities, and nice afternoon happy hour drinks provided. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a quiet place close to everything.",5
"Wonderful Rooms, Service Needs Improvement",Waxmanloilee,"The rooms are nice and spacious. The bathrooms are the standout, but the ""king size bed"" isn't a real one, it is 2 beds put together. The pool is huge and amazing not too many people. The gym is big too. When we were checking in we asked if we could have a late check-out and the reception staff was new. She went to ask her supervisor what the latest check-out time we could have and we overheard her supervisor say ""they are ONLY in a deluxe room so 1pm is the latest they can get..."" This was disappointing and kinda put a sour start to our trip but we just ignored it. Some of the concierge staff in the front of the hotel need a brushing up. One of them had his tie undone and shirt untucked, looked so bad for a ""5 star hotel."" Location is good and aircon was cold so that is an…",4
Really friendly staff,Craig B,We stayed in one of the ground rooms which were lovely and clean with big beds. The hotel staff are really friendly and couldn’t do enough for us. There’s a good choice at breakfast but if you know the area better or you’re not in a rush then you could find a hawker centre for a lot cheaper. My only complaint would be that the rooms are that high tech I was closing the curtains instead of turning the lights on!  Would highly recommend this place. ,5
Service unsatisfactory,Oktos,"Location in fort canning is wonderful. Rooms are amazing, especially the bathroom with marble and huge bay window.   However, for an hotel of this standing, most of the staff was surprisingly unfriendly. This is a comment we've shared with my colleagues, as we were staying for a 3 days seminar.",4
"Friendly staff, clean rooms. ",Elizabeth,"First impressions of this hotel were fantastic. Courteous, friendly staff and a beautiful room with great facilities. The room was extremely comfortable and the large bed was excellent. The only criticism I would have is that the light control panel for the room keep lighting up in the night which if you are a very light sleeper (like me) can wake you up frequently. ",4
A historical gem with great customer service,Jaqueline S,"I've been to Singapore many times and have experienced several hotels. Since we first stayed at Hotel Fort Canning, we've always come back, even though it's not always the most convenient for our business which is usually near NUS. It's a 5-star experience, but two things make it really stand out: first, the service from the staff, who go above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your stay. By 'above and beyond' I include phoning for the hotel engineer to bring some superglue to repair a broken pair of spectacles. Second, unlike so many hotels in Singapore, Fort Canning continues to respect Singapore history. It literally was a fort, or rather the British Command HQ during WWII. Without compromising modern amenities it manages to convey a sense of that heritage. It's also surrounded…",5
Luxury on the Edge of Downtown Singapore,Chapel Hill10,"Hotel Fort Canning delivers 5 star service. Period. No debate on this.  The rooms are wonderful. Their deluxe rooms are better appointed and larger than suites in many hotels. The beds are super comfortable and the showers luxurious.  The hotel offers a unique service too.  Guests receive a complimentary smartphone for use locally (internet) and on which they can make local calls. The hotel uses the latest tech as well.  There are no switches in the rooms for lights, AC or blinds - everything is sensor activated.  Uber cool. The front desk and all staff are extremely professional and efficient.

Lovely stay at Hotel Fort Canning,Sarah,"My sister and I recently stayed at the hotel for 5 days. The whole experience was wonderful. The hotel staff were so courteous and went out of their way to help us, which for me,  made being there with a knee injury so much easier to deal with.  The hotel has a calm, tranquil feel - perfect for adults and it is an oasis in the city. The rooms were lovely, extremely comfortable with amazing bathrooms! We would definitely choose the stay here again and to recommend the hotel to anyone.",5
A great stay,Cazmac26,"This is a great hotel - super comfortable with wonderful staff providing some of the best service I’ve ever received. The restaurant, pool and common areas are lovely, and the rooms are massive, comfortable and clean. The breakfast buffet isn’t the most extensive hotel buffet I’ve seen, but it’s good and fresh, and the free daily aperitif hour is a really pleasant way to spend time before dinner.   The addition of free use of a local smart phone while in Singapore was and unexpected and awesome addition. It was so useful for making reservations, using google maps and finding restaurants and shops nearby. ",4
Perfect for relaxing,Sunshine557481,"The atmosphere was relaxed, staff extremely helpful and friendly. Happy hour was very enjoyable as it gave you a chance to talk to other guests and learn more about activities and places of interest to visit.

Wonderful 5 Star Gem,lyndabeckwith,"We have been staying here for 1 week  and we have had the most wonderful time.  It is a smaller hotel than a lot of hotels in Singapore and not high rise which suits  us very well. It is situated in Fort Canning  Park so is surrounded by beautiful trees. It is so quiet just beautiful. The two pool areas are great after a busy day exploring  Singapore. Bedrooms are amazing and well equipped. The free drinks and canapés served at 6pm are great and it is nice to meet up and chat to the other guests. Breakfast  Is beautiful and would certainly recommend  taking this option. We will be sorry to  leave tomorrow, thank you Fort Canning and a big thank you to all the staff.",5
Brief stopover luxury,Sue F,"We decided to have a short stopover in Singapore for 2 nights at the end of a recent holiday and chose to enjoy ourselves with a bit of luxury . Hotel Fort Canning certainly provided that. Although our room wasn't large , it was very comfortable , the bathroom was spacious and creature comforts such as a coffee machine in the room , a phone to use for daytime guidance as well as calls back home if required and friendly and accommodating staff made for an enjoyable couple of nights. In addition , and extra $25 SD credit for booking with the hotel directly was happily used for a meal and a drink in our room on our late arrival.

Relaxing stay,Carol B,"I stayed here for 5 nights. Rooms are a good size and very clean. Love the glass bathroom, but if light disturbs your sleep you may not love it - even though the window treatments are good. Smart lighting in room,  and handy smart phone provided for use whilst out & about. Happy hour for guests provided free pour drinks and canapés. Breakfast was good and platters regularly topped up. Large gym with excellent equipment and a yoga room. Lovely pools set over 2 levels - one resort style, the other for laps. Lounge chairs would be more comfortable with cushions.  All staff friendly and helpful. Good location, about 5 min walk to Canning Fort and Dhoby Ghaut MRTs.",5

Good hotel for a getaway,Zeit222,"Visited the hotel with our 8month old on 23mar. Requested for baby cot during our booking and was promptly told that they noted our request. Check in was a Breeze - comfortable chairs, dedicated front desk giving us full attention, walked us to our room, informed us of the necessary, and of course baby cot was in the room as promised. Room is nice and big. Pool was small-ish but comes with baby pool and it’s not crowded. Hotel provided free flow wine from 6pm-7pm nightly - a huge bonus. Didn’t give full 5 stars as there were some minor down side - hotel only has one restaurant and food was just average; It was a little hassle to get out of hotel to elsewhere; room/aircon were a little dusty. Would recommend this hotel though, especially for a getaway.  It’s a much better option…",4

Very good services,PattaJN,"Cozy  and nice surrounding.    The service agents are very nice.

"Wonderful stay in secluded, charming characterful hotel",ran,"I searched lots of options for a hotel in Singapore, which is brimming with large, glitzy hotels from the usual chains. Hotel Fort Canning is different, and I would thoroughly recommend it.  Firstly, it's smaller and more personal. We encountered one of the front desk staff a couple of times, who remembered various little details we'd enquired about, and she demonstrated an impressive memory!  The number of rooms is small, so the feel is more personal than many Singapore hotels. The room we had was lovely - spacious, with a huge bed and good shower. The swimming pool was close at hand and quiet. The hotel even offers guests free wine in the early evening for a couple of hours, which was a nice touch, esp given the cost of alcohol in Singapore.   Also, because the hotel is…",5
Outstanding Customer Service,Kylie H,"If I could give this hotel more than 5 stars I would, from the moment we arrived we were made to feel like we were the only ones at the hotel.  We only stayed one night after a cruise and before we flew home, but we wish it was more.  We arrived early, and didn't expect our room to be ready so headed off to the shopping area which was walking distance, along with the doby ghant MRT station so location was excellent.  When we returned our room was ready, and we settled in. Lovely room, automation galore, plus a hand held device to help you navigate around Singapore which was really handy.  Pool area was lovely, and the garden location was really quiet and relaxing.  Because our flight wasn't until 7pm the next day, they gave us a later checkout, stored our bags while we went out…",5
Garden Haven in the City,World_Cup_Wanderer,"We were attracted to the Hotel Fort Canning because it was an old colonial style building in the middle of a large park.  In Singapore - a city of building towers and people - this hotel offered a different more relaxed accommodation option.  We were not disappointed with our decision.  It was a delightful oasis with charm and friendliness that enhanced our short stay in Singapore.  We arrived early morning, and dispite the time well in advance of check-in, the hotel staff were welcoming and did their best to offer what amenities and assistances they could until room could be made ready for us.  This was not an issue for us as we had friends who were also staying the hotel and had checked in the night before.  Nonetheless the staff efforts were commendable in the genuine concern…",5
Excellent hotel set in lovely parkland in Singapore,Alison H,"The hotel itself is in a lovely location being set in parkland, very central to MRT interchange station and close to many areas of interest to tourists.

Not a bad option for Singapore,Catherine F,"A really nice hotel set in a park in central Singapore. Pros: beautiful hotel, amazing room, good location if you want to stay somewhere quiet. Cons: breakfast wasn’t good quality, the hotel does feel isolated from the rest of the town and you have to order taxis in advance. The strangest thing for me was that people could see into my bathroom from the outside eating area. We’re talking a shower and toilet next the window (which is floor to ceiling). It was a pain to have to put the electric blind down and then need the lights on everything you needed the loo! Overall I’d stay again but there are more convenient hotels in Singapore. ",4

History Revisited,Midorosan,"The title is very personal as I clearly remember visiting this building as a young sergeant in the British Army en route to Borneo in 1964, it was then the headquarters of the Far East Command under Gen.

The rooms are small but very functional and the bathrooms have been installed in what was previously the balcony that ran the length of the building and down which I once marched.

I also found the staff to be attentive and helpful in particular the guys handling the breakfast as nothing was too much trouble.  I used the pool to cool down (located on second floor) in the afternoon which was great and there is also child friendly pool. Towels are provided.  HFC is located in the centre of Singapore and is easy to get around whether it be by public transport or by getting a taxi.

The building itself is historic, striking and has been beautifully converted in a lovely setting. The stand out feature must be the pools, both large - one for lengths and one for leisure. The lack of chlorine is such an attraction, no sore eyes and stinky costumes, what a joy! We also very much appreciated the drinks and canopies in reception every evening - what a nice touch! Excellently located, the hotel is easy walking distance to the excellent metro system, the riverfront restaurants and bars, Fort Canning Park (brilliant) and the National Museum (also brilliant). Walking up all the front steps every day will also help keep you fit! The reception staff were especially helpful from start to finish, and even gave me a birthday…",4
Great parkland setting,Tr@vlr,"We spent 7 nights in a Deluxe Garden Room, which we chose because of the garden seating area that is attached to the room. This was a good choice because it was lovely to sit outside and have a coffee each morning, but a bad choice because the room is arguably too small for a couple for an extended stay. Other reviewers have spoken about the very intimate bathroom configuration, which is probably much better suited for lone travelers than couples. Couples beware.  The hotel itself was very good. The restaurant excelled for both breakfast (an extensive buffet catering to European, American, SE Asian and Chinese tastes) and dinner (the Laksa was really nice, and the fries will remind a lot of western visitors about life before hydrogenated vegetable oil). The swimming pools were a…",4
Absolutely wonderful!,Bryan Soo,"My partner and I chose this hotel for our little anniversary celebration and it definitely did not let us down a single bit! All the way from the moment we alighted from our taxi till the checkout.   The friendly porter offered assistance for us the moment we alighted the taxi and helped us with our baggage to the check in counter! The front desk staff was very efficient at checking in, everything was professional and fast. Another staff, Julian, then brought us to show us the hotel facilities and then to our room and did a tour of our room features as well. Personalised service indeed!   The room was huge! Decorations were beautiful, and the ceiling was much taller than the hotels i have stayed with as well! The bathroom was also large with a beautiful bathtub that had a…",5
One of the best hotels in Singapore,Sigurður B,I had a great stay at hotel Fort Canning. Excellent location in the middle of fort canning park where possibilities are to run or take a walk and enjoy the trees and the flowers in the park. The hotel has an excellent gym and pool side. Pools where you can swim (25m) and to absolutely relax in 30°C. The restaurant offers great breakfast buffet with all sorts of egg courses including the Egg Benedict. The rooms are spacious and comfortable with all that you need for a comfortable stay.,5
Favourite!,Valentino Raj,"I frequent HFC on numerous occasions and yet I find nothing to complaint about. From the property to the service, and not forgetting their dedicated crew, it's definitely one of my favourite hotel in Singapore. Will definitely be there again.",5
Peace & Tranquility,SPBurns17,"Stayed at this lovely hotel during our recent 3 night stay in Singapore. The hotel is the former British arm headquarters and is situated in Fort Canning Park which itself is stepped in history. We loved the location which was still close enough to walk to all the main sights eg Gardens by the Bay. A taxi back up to the hotel is always an option if you don’t fancy the walk up the hill in the heat. The staff were excellent, so attentive and courteous. The early evening complimentary drinks and canapés reception was a nice touch. The rooms were very comfortable, immaculately clean and were equipped with everything you would need for your stay. The pool area was lovely whether you wanted to do some lengths or simply relax and chill. Also availed of the on-site Chinois spa for some…",5
Loved it.,mintlawman,"We were here for a wedding and it did not disappoint.  From our arrival till we left we had no complaints. Our rooms were lovely, light and airy, great shower also. Breakfast was what you would expect, with many new Singapore, Chinese and Indian tastes covered as well. The bar , pool and gardens were also to the same standard. We also loved the wedding with a great buffet and helpful staff. Just go.",5
Great hotel!,RMLDN2015,"Exceptional service - the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff extremely helpful. Nice touches in the room such as phones with google maps to use when you are out and about in town, shower facilities to use even after check out, massage and gym centre as well as free happy hour every evening ! Highly recommend if visiting Singapore. ",5
Stopover for 3 days on the way to Euro,Bronte G,"Pros- Staff and service Breaky buffet was incredible Gorgeous room Bath tub Swimming pool Happy hour from 6-7  Cons(for some people they were barely cons for us) The buttons for the windows and lights in the room might be a bit tricky  Expensive coffee on the room service menu Lots of stairs outside the hotel if you are planning on walking to a few place  The tapas offered for the happy hour (but free so it's ok)!!  Overall I would recommend this beautiful hotel to any one and I would stay here again and again.   Special thanks to Julian for helping us out with food suggestions, Din Tai Fung is a must!!!",5
Poor service standards ,Vashistha M,"After reading fairly good reviews on Tripadvisor, we went ahead with booking this hotel for a staycation. However, the service level of this hotel can be best compared to a 2-3 star hotel.   1. Receptionist at check in - very cold - was our anniversary and it clearly mentioned that on our booking - Niceties were not offered but what was pathetic was she didn’t even care to wish us!  2.  Ordered drinks at the pool - the waiter came with the tray - there was no table where we were sitting and I asked waiter to help with a small table (kept near the pool side) to be placed where we were. Simply refused saying thats not her job. We shifted the small table ourselves.  3. Staff fainted at restaurant but other staff was indifferent: a staff member (waiter) fainted while serving guests…",2
Lovely Hotel set in beautiful gardens and historic parklands,Michael G,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning one night as a stop over hotel. The hotel is about 20 minutes taxi ride fro Changi Airport.  The welcome was warm, informative and personal. We were escorted to our room and given information about meals, pools and happy hours.  The room was a reasonable size with large bath area on the external wall. Lovely big comfortable queen size bed, large screen TV, safe, coffee making facilities, iron and ironing board, reliable wifi and large cupboard space.  The hotel have a lovely swimming pool - one for toddlers and one for older people with lounge chairs and umbrellas or covered cabanas.  The restaurant on the ground floor provided nice light meals as well as main curse dinners and lunches. Nice hotel - will stay there again",4
Staycation,HANI1411,It was refreshing with quiet and green surroundings. The rooms were newly-furbished and well kept. Staff was generally friendly and knowledgeable. The CNY celebration decoration was particularly nice and not too overwhelming.  The only thing that we didn’t get was having a twin room next to the king bed one. Other than that we had a restful and memorable experience. Thank you very much. Keep up the great work.,5
Perfect staycation,Faza Zai,"This is my second time staying in the hotel. Totally love the peaceful ambience and location. Room was very comfortable with nice,friendly staffs. Will definitely be coming back again for another staycation.",5
VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,cbt65,The hotel is wonderfully situated in a peaceful and historic wooded area of the city . The staff are friendly and very well trained. The décor and rooms are of a very high standard . A REALLY EXCELLENT CHOICE IN EVERY WAY,5
Relaxing staycation,Selina M,"This hotel is situated amongst the beautiful quiet surroundings of Fort Canning Park but minutes walk from some fantastic eating spots and shopping. We stayed in a deluxe garden room for a 2-night staycation. The room was well presented and we enjoyed the lovely deep bath and garden area - the daybed was great for an afternoon read and nap! The room had complimentary nescafe coffee pods and Twinnings tea bags. The curtains blacked out the room so well that we slept until 10am - unheard of usually! Each evening from 6-7pm, there are complimentary drinks (prosecco, white and red wine and juice) and canapes - an added extra that was certainly appreciated. There was an extra charge for breakfast so we opted not to do this and to eat brunch out instead. It was nice to have lazy…",5
Awesome 5 Star hotel,CherylC,"Room was awesome, we got the bed in the middle which is fine to us. There are 2 swimming pool. Quiet and peaceful away from town. About 10mins walk to plazasing. Staff was great with the teaching on how to use the equipment in the room. Cake was given to my boyfriend thou his bday was afew days later. Overall will come back again!",5
Enjoyable stay,NomadicForever,"If you enjoy access to big city but want a few quiet hours between shopping and sightseeing, HFC is a good location in green and quiet surroundings with lovely pool and great gym. HFC is more like a small resort. You have easy access to MRT. I was a bit imobile due to a recent accident. Hotel provided a wheelchair, staff was very helpful all round. Wheelchair access was no problem within the hotel area. We spent 3 days at HFC. It was a relaxing stay.",4
Superb in every way,debralberta,"A beautiful, elegant hotel in a beautiful, historic park. Great location - we used the nearby metro to easily sightsee other neighbourhoods and there were two great museums right on the park property itself (National Museum of Singapore and Battlebox Museum).  The room itself was comfortable and quiet with a large marble bathroom pierced with windows showcasing the gorgeous landscaping.  Only had one small quibble - water temp in shower was lukewarm at best.  If we had stayed longer than one night, we would definitely have asked the hotel to look into it.  Interestingly, we had stayed in another hotel in Singapore a week earlier, and the shower temp was lukewarm there too.  Maybe a Singapore thing? Staff was very accommodating when we arrived early and had us relax in the…",5
Toilet integrated in the room is somewhat special,Martin P,"Great building, nice rooms with garden. Breakfast not so good, slightly expensive. But what we didnt‘t like was the toilet and the shower, that both were nearly not separated from the room. If one of the passengers has to go to the toilet, the remaining can hear, see and smell what the other is doing.",3
Deluxe room (Jan 2019),Fyeeza Mislan,Stayed 1 night at the deluxe room. Very good customer service from the guy on duty at the hotel lobby. After bringing us up to our room he wished my boyfriend a advanced happy birthday. That says he was observant during the checking in. They even had a slice of cake prepared for my boyfriend. I really appreciate it and would definitely come back!,5
Magnificent Experience! ,Chris B,"Hotel Fort Canning is superbly located in the beautiful Fort Canning Park with a wonderful team of amazing hospitality minded super stars! Really very friendly, helpful and supportive in every area .. During my short two days stay it was like feeling being home, so cozy and knowing that you are looked after if you have any inquiries.. My cozy very well maintained and equipped room was a pleasant feeling to spend time in ...  Front office Assistant Manager Mr Kelson and his team are true Stars!!  My Food & Beverage experiences were great as well with a nice selection of fresh products on the breakfast ... And what made me feel great was the chef on that early Sunday morning to make me a egg white omelet made in high level cuisine, well done Chef.  Early mornings I was out at 6.30…",5
Beautiful and Quiet Hotel,terencek87,"We had a peaceful and quiet stay-cation at Hotel Fort Canning. Away from the city, it's approximately 10 minutes away from Dhoby Ghaut Mrt Station. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The room is extremely spacious and clean. Overall, we had a wonderful time and would definitely return in the future.",5
Outstanding ,MrsCR2014,We stayed in Hotel Fort Canning for 3 nights and it was wonderful!  The check in process was quick and efficient and our room was ready early. The gentleman who checked us in also provided us with lots of useful information on places to see in the city. The location is on top of a hill in it’s own little oasis of tranquility. However Clark’s Quay is only 10-15 minutes away on foot and the MRT station is even closer. We ate dinner in the hotel on our first night and it was delicious. Breakfast was also very tasty and a special mention to Neilia (hope I spelt it correctly!) as she was especially helpful with my gluten free preferences. I had read previous reviews which suggested that breakfast was a ‘bun fight’ however that was not our finding at all. There was a huge variety of…,5
Fantastic,Ventelerst,"This is my second time staying at this hotel, loved how they transformed an antique building into a modern and elegant hotel, with a touch of luxury, while preserving the quaintness. The room is cosy and romantic, and the bathroom is simply huge with a big bathtub. Stayed at Deluxe Garden and Premium Room, both are excellent. Choose Deluxe Garden if you're looking for a more romantic setting.  Situated at Fort Canning hill, the hotel offers tranquility despite being near the heart of CBD, which is a rather unique experience.",5
Despicable customer service,NatashaLN,"I booked a stay at the hotel for my mother and I over New Year. Unfortunately, after our first night my mother received a call to say that her eldery father, (my grandfather) who already has advanced alzhimers of 89 had very low blood pressure, a life threatening chest and lung infection and was in a very bad way, so we had to cut our visit short to return on the next flight home. Despite explaining to The Hotel Fort Canning our return was due to conpletely unforseen and very serious issues they refused to refund me for the nights that we did not use. Whilst I understand the booking was non-recundable you would hope in a situation as distressing as this, the hotel would act decently and you wouldn’t have to deal with a battle like this. I am absolutely appalled and would never…",1
Short weekend break,Hani A,Chanced upon the hotel accidentally through a travel booking site and what a surprise i got- The luxury hotel definitely deserves a repeat- Lovely rooms- superb views and ambience- terrific staff who makes sure you are taken care of and little things like offering easily a late check out when our room was delayed in readiness for check in . I will definitely return !,5
Ashish Lande,ASHISHLANDE,The Hotel is a good place stay.   Enjoyed the stay.  Good breakfast and excellent rooms.  You can have a morning walk at fort canning park. Enjoy the weather and environment.  It is approximately 500 meters from nearest metro. ,5
An absolute gem,nmv,"Can't say enough about this hotel.  They have made an amazing transition from a former military headquarters to a very comfortable hotel.  We loved our room with the balcony bathroom and greenery view.  Many things to comment on on - wonderful staff, great food, large beautiful pool; surrounded with history.  We found this to be a real quiet respite from the hectic city.  Situated in a park on top of Fort Canning Hill is a great place to walk although a bit of a hike from public transportation.  If you do not want to walk we found taxi's available and relatively inexpensive. Treat yourself to his gem.  We hope to return again soon",5

Fantastic Stay,Chrissie2506,"Everything was absolutely amazing. The pool was gorgeous, room service was fast and delicious and staff always friendly and willing to assist.

Wedding Anniversary,Shasha,I had a smooth planning with one of their staff name Fawly. She had the room set up for our wedding anniversary. Told her as well that i am coming with my kids and she ask if i need a baby cot. Great initiative!   Check in by Saif was a breeze.   The front desk staff definetly know who their guest and wish us a wedding anniversary.   Room was clean and awesome. Housekeeping service was great too when i requested them to my room.  Breakfast was yummy and the restaurant staff was friendly and service was great.   Check out was a breeze too by Abigail. She asked if our stay was ok and i replied yes of course!   Would definetly reccomend couple celebrating their wedding anniversary to HFC as it is quiet and relaxing.,5
R & R,Lee S,"Unique setting very impressive surrounds on the top of Fort Canning.

Staff friendly and attentive, breakfast buffet good variety and of a high standard and room accommodation comfortable including king size bed very comfortable with a lovely clean bathroom as well as peaceful throughout internal and external property. Stayed twice at hotel during this vacation. First on commencement of vacation (Mid December 2018) and then a return visit (mid Jan 2019) of last few days of vacation and was treated extremely well on both occasions.

Afternoon tea,Fiona M,"Handy place for afternoon tea after walking round Fort Canning Park and the Bunkers and for getting shelter for an hour from the rain storm  Very nice 28 sing dollar tea but doesn’t compare to the Raffles experience  Raffles closed for refurb ( jan 2019)  Novel way of serving cakes & savouries in like a little portable bookcase!  No tea top ups offered   Attention to detail not there, but it was a perfectly pleasant experience",4
A Pleasant Stay Away From All The Hustle,NrlAisyah,"Had a short one night stay at Hotel Fort Canning, and we were pleasantly greeted by the reception lady (Irvena, I think?). She helped to check us in with no hassle, all done in about 10mins. We were then walked to our room on the 2nd floor and we immediately fell in love with the interior, the comfy king sized bed and the bathtub which was smacked right in the middle. It was really nice! I love how personalised the whole experience was (given that I am also working in a hotel not too far away), right from the moment we step foot and the second we left. Just one thing to note though, the shower was running a little too cold even when it was turned max to the hotter side! But overall, everything in this hotel was amazing and we’ll be back surely! Keep up the wonderful job! ",5
Excellent hotel and staffs,viviensim12345,"This hotel is a hidden gem! Nestled away in fort canning. The room was amazing, we got the cheapest room and it came with king bed and the most beautiful bathroom I've ever seen.  Room:  Decent size, bed was slightly harder than other hotels but still a great sleep. Bathroom tiled in marble flooring and toiletries provided.   Service:  From the minute we enter the hotel, we were greeted warmly. Reception lady was very friendly and professional. Spa service was pricey but well worth it! 30% off hotel guests for a certain time.   Location:  Centralized location but since the main road leading up here was blocked, we had difficulties getting taxi drivers to send us up here. Easier to ask the hotel staff to book taxis for you while you hang out in the exquisite lobby.  Apart from…",5
Outstand Service,dmckirahan,"This boutique hotel is a little piece of paradise in bustling Singapore.  Location is stellar - only a few minutes walk from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station or Clark Quay yet nestled in peaceful, tropical Ft Canning park.

If you enjoy history, this hotel is surrounded by it.  Book your holiday now!",5
Excellent Stay,Wonder,"Very good service. The place is quiet yet convenient as it is about 10 min walk to Plaza Singapura.  The staff are v friendly and there is also someone who brings us to the room to show us how to on and off the lighting, air  con etc.  In addition, they also decorated the room for our anniversary.  The eletrical seems quite high-tech. The curtain is controlled by technology and kettle is also interesting to be used in the drawer. Seemed to me that it is an induction kettle.  Excellent stay!",5
First stop on a South east asia tour,Jesper B,"Fantastic hotel, the pool area was so relaxed (no other guests than us using that area while we were there) with nice addition of complimentry drinks at 5 O'clock.  Only complaints is that the beds and pillows where a bit to firm.",5
Perfect location,yllipojken,"We spend 6 nights in Singapore and the hotel is perfectly located and within walking distance from everything you can explore in Singapore. Shopping in Orchard row, drinking and eating at Clarke Quay or Little India and Chinatown, everything is 10-20 minutes nearby on foot. The room was great, staff is very friendly and attentive and the food is excellent. We will choose Hotel Fort Canning for future trips to Singapore.",5
Staycation - quiet getaway,Alvin Ngo,A last minute decision to spend a night here.  Nestled along a lot of nature with old heritage buildings.  A historic site.  Efficient n friendly staff at check in.  Ample parking space.  Great for a quiet retreat.  Nice for walks around the hotel.  Just outside Orchard Road.  Accessible and walking distance to Shopping centres.  Tried the high tea st in house cafe.  Room spacious and clean.  Three separate areas.  Strongly recommended.,5
Stress-free and pleasant stay,Gowri K,"The staff are polite and gracious - very thorough and resourceful when they were dealing with each guest. At check-in, the staff demonstrated how to use the touch-sensitive air-conditioning and lighting controls, plus general details about breakfast, after-dinner drinks, etc. Even though the hotel was within walking distance of a mall, it still felt isolated and quiet, which is great if you're looking for a stress-free vacation. There were some really noisy guests (kids) staying in the rooms surrounding mine, but that's pretty much the only major gripe I had during my stay. Restaurant staff could be a bit more pleasant, especially in terms of delivering room service; minor things like placing the bill on the table before I was done with my breakfast could be avoided. Other than…",4
"Poor cleaning, attention to detail and rude restaurant staff",Oztraveller1444,"Cleanliness at this hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The pillow protectors underneath the pillow cases were filthy. Brown and very marked from sweat. All 4 pillows were like this. When were they last cleaned? I even left a pillow case off one of the pillows to show housekeeping- they just put another pillow case on top. The smell when you had your head on the pillows was disgusting. The blanket when you pulled back the cover was also stained with brown sweat marks and you could smell other people’s sweat, gross. The chaise chair was also visibly stained. The lamp on the desk on arrival was flickering had to turn it off at the wall. The faux wood floor was dusty and had greasy footprints on it on arrival and remained the same throughout the stay. In the bathroom, there was dust…",2

Weekend stay at Hotel Fort Canning,Daryl Yap,"Overall the experience was really great. The room given to me was really nice, and the service was superb. I had a few special requests during my stay at the hotel, and the hotel staff had played their part to meet and fulfil my requests exactly as I wanted. Perhaps the only point that needs improvement will be their breakfast. The selection was very limited. However, food quality was still acceptable. Will definitely return for another stay here.",5

Need improvement for Cleanliness,EK931211,"Was having a 1 Night staycation on 17th Dec. Room is spacious and the mattress is so comfy. However room cleanliness need improvement. Throw cushion cover on the bed was not tied properly hence both side looks different and unsightly. There are some debris on the floor. Standing shower flooring can see algae growing on the silicone and bathroom mirror was oily as well. Besides, was a bit disappointing that bathrobe only available upon request and it is a Yukata instead of bathrobe. It will be good as well if there is anti slip mat in the bathroom. ",3

Need to allow TV to play customer's hdmi input,Chong Yichen,Hi.  It will be good to allow TV in the rooms to be able to play customers hdmi input.

Secluded,JohnCarruthers,"We stayed at this hotel for four days prior to a cruise. It is a magnificent typical Singaporean colonial building. It has been well redeveloped into a hotel with sizeable rooms on three levels. What were the original balconies have been enclosed to become the en-suites to most rooms. Lighting, air-con and blinds are all controlled by touch panels which can be a little confusing but soon worked out. The dining room (The Salon) has a good choice of quality food (at reasonable prices) and drinks from the adjoining bar. In fact we dined there on three of the nights, something we wouldn’t normally do in hotel dining rooms. Service was good from all staff. A nice touch was the complimentary wines between 6 and 7 each evening. It created a small community atmosphere amongst the guests…",4

Long Weekend in Singapore,Jane A,"This hotel was recommended to us and we’re so glad we booked there. A beautiful colonial building surrounded by Fort Canning Park; a real peaceful haven in the midst of a bustling city. An easy ten minute walk to the MRT, Clark Quay and Orchard Road. Keep in mind this is situated on a hill, so there are quite a few steps to get back to the hotel, but taxis are always readily available in Singapore. We had a Premium room overlooking the park and we couldn’t hear traffic at all. The rooms are beautifully decorated and bathrooms well-equipped. The staff were very friendly yet quietly efficient. Although we’ve stayed in a number of hotels in Singapore in the past, this will definitely be our hotel of choice in the future.",5

The room was beautiful with views of Fort Canning Park, wonderfully comfortable bed, bathroom with separate shower and bath and a separate lounge / study area. The hotel provide a mobile for personal use around Singapore and the breakfast should not be missed. Wish we’d made more use of the gym area and the pool. We felt looked after especially at 6pm drinks and canapés in the guest lounge. They even offered us a shower and refresh area before our evening flight.

Lovely .Not sure about the toliet doors,dlbennett3454,"Great location.Easy access to Orchard and the train stations.Its our 4th stay. Hotel full of character.Helpful staff. Took lunch and breakfast . Lunch good. Breakfast OK but expensive. Again as last year when we stayed the breakfast is rather chaotic. One coffee machine and tea area. No tea pots . No milk jugs. Cereal selection  isnt great. One toaster. You spend more time walking aroung and waiting  than you do eating and drinking. Why not serve tea and coffee drinks at the table to reduce congestion. You do this at lunch and you supply tea in a tea pot with a milk jug! Rooms are nice.

The hotel clean, comfortable, well maintained and set in lovely surroundings with great facilities and very welcoming staff. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.",5
Classy,feesyish,"Although this hotel was a short hilly walk to a tube station or local restaurants, we loved staying here.  It was peaceful and generous. After a holiday in India the pools, beautiful room, free phone and luscious lotions, were just what we needed.  Taxis are cheap and with a blistered toe we used them regularly. Having free drinks from 6 to 7 meant that we met some very interesting guests. The staff were exceptional. ",5
Great experience,Marcello P,"I stayed at HFC for a week. It was a great experience and I believe I will return here in the future.  Rooms are comfortable and the furniture is great. Sofas, lamps and beds. The bathroom is spectacular and comfortable.  Breakfast is very good and you can choose between English, US, continental or Asian foods.  The service is cosy.  ",5
Our Home away from home,Neil_GPerth,Our company has multiple shareholders and interested investors in Singapore and we are in Singapore 3-5 times per year.  We always stay at the Hotel Fort Canning it is open friendly and we have a balcony or windows that we can get the fresh air.  In Singapore you are lucky as there are a number of hotels that have an old world charm with opening windows and balconies but we like the Hotel Fort Canning as it is one the hill in the park.  Not glitzy not glamour just a lovely place to just be and the breakfasts are world class and they taste real.  Yes it is our home away from home.,5
Relaxing Stay in Singapore...,Ddorfer,"Situated in a very nice Location, with very friendly Stuff and nice Rooms. After a busy Day, it is comforting you with a quite and relaxing atmosphere. Orchard Road and nice Restaurants are only a short walk away. Will come back ....",5
Heaven in a Park,Chandrasekar S,The stay was absolutely amazing. Great service and the room was simply amazing with all the necessary items that a stay requires. The hotel does have a history to it which adds further appeal to travellers. All in all it was a great stay.,5
Expensive and Old property,Kiran0092,"Hotel fort canning is situated at a very nice location - Fort Canning Garden. It is amidst lush green garden and beautiful environ. That’s the best about this hotel.   However, beyond that the things start looking downwards..  Hotel seems to be under some repair-which is not mentioned anywhere. You get a surprise when you reach there. Pictures of the place are taken in such a manner, everything appears grand on the website, but not so true when you reach there. We took a deluxe room, it is spacious. But the wooden flooring was pretty much old and at some places even the wall colour was falling out. Does not have good restaurants as well, the food options are very limited.  Area around the pool is under repair, so going in the pool was not an option. This was not even mentioned,…",2
Good hotel in a great location,Richard P,"If you fancy a respite from the hurly burly of Singapore then this is it.  Central Singapore ..... but set in the grounds of Fort Canning so you have peace and space.    The rooms are well appointed, the service is good.  Whilst the website talks of panoramic city views then this would be an over statement on the YWCA side.  Views are limited.  Pool area does not have the breadth and scale of a modern hotel - but you this is an acceptable compromise for the lovely position.   Overall a very enjoyable stay.    (If helpful do leave a helpful vote. Thanks )",4
"Great experience, we would definitely book the hotel for a next stay again",Marcel W,"Great location in a park, close to Orchard Road, close to Metro station, nice room with a bathroom next to the window, Nespresso machine free for use in the room, free mobile even for taking out of the room, very friendly staff",5
Lovely colonial hotel,Sion J,"Lovely, historic building in the centre of the park for those that enjoy a stroll. Centrally located but many may opt for a taxi or grab if you don’t fancy walking up the steep hill or steps. The garden room layout isn’t suitable for infants and the toilet also opens straight into the room but they were very good about moving us to a bigger room to fit a cot. The private garden is nice in those rooms if that’s what you’re looking for. The complementary drinks and snacks each evening were very popular and they were very generous with the selection on offer. They have a nice garden area outside too if you prefer that to sitting at the indoor bar. A little expensive but not unreasonable for a 5 star hotel in Singapore. Would definitely recommend it if you are looking for something…",4
Best place to stay and relax after a long day,DayTrip827739,Hotel staff were very accommodating and very friendly. Bathroom is breath taking. Gym facilities were advanced and complete. Didn't manage to try the pool but hopefully will get a chance to the next time I fly down to Singapore. Bed was comfortable and breakfast buffet was delicious! My view of the city was not too great but was not much of an issue for me.,5
Still Love this Outstanding Place,BevWalker,"Visited for the second time in July this year  We loved this place on our first visit, however had reservations about the housekeeping.  No problems this time obviously this problem has been rectified.  Singapore is a wonderful, hot, exhilarating city and as a result can be pretty exhausting, so to have a beautiful peaceful oasis like this to return to after a day exploring is the perfect  foil, an impressive historical building set in an equally historic stunning park. Every aspect of this hotel gets a five from us. Staff, services, room, surroundings and the food.  The food was petty good the first time we visited, however this time had been lifted to another level, really delicious. The hotel's local dishes were outstanding.  We like to get out and eat local food, which we…",5
We will love to visit again!,ashleych0i,"For the first time, I will start with a few drawbacks or disappointed we had during our stay before I moved on to why we still love this hotel.  Cons: - Arrival lobby is really narrow and small, only enough to hold one car at a time, thus during peak hours, there will be a line of cars waiting to enter. - Upon arrival, staffs did not help us with our luggage or bring it our room unlike other 5 stars hotels. - Only two check-in counters, thus we needed to wait around 15 mins for our turn to check-in as there were other guests waiting for check-in. However, hotel staffs were really polite and professional during the whole check-in procedure.  - We were disappointed that no one informed us about the complimentary Aperitif Hour (we only learnt about it after reading the reviews…",5
"fantastic, in-town stay-cation, surrounded by greenery!",Troy H,"The fact that you are literally staying in town but it seems like you are still in greenery, alongside having the historical aspect of Fort Canning on the doorstep, makes this a fantastic spot! The hotel is lovely and service does not disappoint. The pre-dinner drinks in the private lounge give a sense of class and refinement and are a wonderful way to relax into the evening. The staff were excellent: helpful, efficient and genuinely interested in ensuring our stay was all it could be. My wife and I travelled with two young children (9 & 6), and in Singapore, many hotels are set up for couples - making finding a room for a family quite difficult. However, the staff ensured we had connecting rooms and this was perfect.",5
Great hotel and location for a peaceful and relaxing stay,_glenn_allum,"Just returned from a fabulous week long stay at the hotel.  The room was great well-appointed and maintained and the addition of a balcony bathroom gave you more space.  With its location within Fort Canning Park and its tranquil and peaceful surroundings make you forget your staying in a large city, however your still only a short walk from the MRT and Clarke Quay.  The hotels colonial architecture makes for a great change from all the other large chain hotels located in Singapore.  The staff were very polite, friendly and helpful nothing was too much trouble.  I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone looking at somewhere great to stay, I would also recommend you include breakfast when making your booking this will elevate the worry of trying to find somewhere…",5
Review,fueledbysaints15,"I enjoyed my stay at Hotel Fort Canning and many thanks to the management for giving us such a delightful experience. Together with the ambience and decor of the hotel and room which is pleasing to the eyes and lightens our mood each time we come back to the room. Thank you as well to housekeeping for ensuring our room is spick and span every time. I appreciate the hotel giving me a complimentary cake for my birthday, not forgetting the complimentary late check out as well. I will definitely come back again to Hotel Fort Canning.",5
Beautiful hotel amounts beautiful surroundings,danielleburns91,"We stayed here for the second leg of our honeymoon, and we were so pleased we chose this little gem. We chose this hotel due to it being off the main road and away from the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road. It was idyllic. The staff were attentive and polite, they even brought me a cake with a candle, up to our room as they saw it was my birthday. Which was a lovely gesture. The room itself was a decent size and the bathroom was “goals” with marble tiles and a massive bath!! They also go through how to work the touch pad system that controls the lights, blinds and aircon which I thought was good. I don’t like busy hotels and this was tranquil, when you walk in you have the lovely sound of water from the small water feature under the staircase and the hotel smells lovely.…",5
Lovely Birthday Staycation,iryanaa,"Chose this hotel for a birthday staycation early last month. Love the tranquil environment surrounding the colonial architecture hotel - amidst the bustling city!   The room was clean, modern and spacious, with all the quirky switches for lights, a/c and curtains. Best yet, right next to the bed - we literally didn’t have to get up! Love the high ceiling and huge bathroom.   Most importantly, we were swoon over their impeccable service! Staffs were friendly and polite. Our check in was assisted by charming Jullian who showed us around the room and the way to their pool. He leaves no details out! We also met their friendly front office manager Kelson who shared with us more about Hotel Fort Canning and its history. We’ve got birthday cake sent after we check in and a late check…",5
Superb ! Best Hotel in Singapore,coll612,I’m always reluctant to share such a review ( in case when we wish to book the hotel is booked out) but it’s unfair of me to not say such lovely things about the HFC ! Superior service/ rooms are spacious and the pool areas are incredible- not uncommon to have the pool areas to yourself. The breakfast offering is amazing- food first class So many Singapore hotels are so large with too many guests and rooms... this offers the complete opposite in an amazing park in the heart of the city and a short walk to Clarke quay Look no further people !,5
Relaxing weekend stay but questionable water quality,Rachel S,"The room was modern and clean. The bathroom had a sliding door, came with a shower and bath tub and overlooked the park. Bathrobes provided on request. Complimentary free parking in the basement of the hotel. And complimentary happy hour in the hotel reception in the evening, which we also enjoyed.   Only problem was that the water coming of the taps was cloudy, and left a brown sand-like residue on the sides of the sink and bathtub. I called reception to ask them about it, and they sent an engineer who came to check, and said he couldn't do anything but just suggested us to flush the taps for a while. The water started to get clearer after flushing for half an hour. However, after an hour or so, the reception called me again, and said that I made a mistake about the cloudy…",4
Here are some tips,Globalcrtique,"I liked this hotel and I found it to be a very nice hotel to stay.  But here are some tips about the hotel.  The Swimming Pool - if you enter the pool area from the second floor, which is the way the staff will direct you. You may be forgiven for not realising there is a second pool on the lower level. You need to walk over to the far barrier and look over to see the lower pool.  The Gym - the gym and salon is located in the annexed modern building near the pool. I only found this on the third day when I was about to leave, as I was looking for the pool showers.I was not informed of this when i arrived.  Clark Quay - It is an easy 10 minute walk to Clarke Quay restaurants. Just ask the front desk how to get there.  Orchard Road - is also only 8 mins away by foot. Leave via the…",4
Fabulous hotel ,Anna M,"My husband was attending a conference for 4 days. I chose this hotel for its quiet and convenient location. Close to MRT train service and main shopping centres. The staff were amazing - so pleasant and helpful.  Our room was large, very clean and very comfortable. The pool area was perfect for relaxing. Complimentary happy hour drinks every night were a bonus. We will definitely stay here again in the future ",5
Beautiful stop over to rest and refresh,9mbhouse,"Our recent stay at Hotel Fort Canning was really wonderful. Impeccable service, lovely comfortable rooms, great proximity to MRT and Singapore attractions all set in a beautiful environment. The happy hour for guests was lovely - a nice way to begin each evening. We recommend and would certainly stay again!",5
Cosy and clean amenities,Elise_opkl,"Tranquil environment of the fort canning park and the friendly staff, especially staff from the check in counter, made my short stay an enjoyable one. Great place to take a mini break from the hustle and bustle of life! Yet, close enough to Clarke Quay and Tanjong Pagar for some booze.",5
Perfect place to be,LoveTravel820550,This is a great hotel with super friendly staff and very nice facilities. Rooms are spatious and modern. I especially liked the bathroom with a view at Fort Canning park. The hotel is both - modern and traditional- something which is not very easy to achieve. It is located within walking distance to the metro MRT and busses. Next time I will come to Singapore I will stay there again.,5
Excellent Service,Rudy28,We decided to celebrate our 21st anniversary in this hotel amongst others available. Service was great although there were some renovations going on in the hotel when we were in the room. They immediately switched our rooms without our request. We had a wonderful private dinner as part of our package that we booked to celebrate our anniversary. Best part was pre-dinner drinks with bubbly and they don’t stinge on their drinks for their guests.   Woke up to a wonder morning and a beautiful day for a walk around lush greenery and certainly was amazed by the number of different species of trees there.  Got back to the hotel and was surprised with a birthday cake! They took notice that I just celebrated my birthday 1 day ago! Service overall was excellent here. I would come again for…,5
Great stay,Andrew S,"First time stay at Fort Canning close to Clark Quay, Orchard Rd did not disappoint . Staying in the park made a nice change from our previous visits to Singapore staff were friendly rooms clean and the use of a mobile phone during our stay was an extra bonus. Would stay again.",5
Historic Five Star,850grahamb,Great historic hotel surrounded by nice gardens and points of interest. Short walk into city. Breakfast was excellent. Room had great views from the bath tub with large electric curtains. Certainly would recommend.,5
I love soaking in the bathtub,Josmin O,"Room - Got the King bed deluxe room for my partner and I for her birthday celebration and I purchased it under the Autumn specials in the park package, which was a great deal offered by the hotel. I compared the prices across the various travel websites but none could beat the rates offered by the hotel. The room was also spacious and I adore the earthy warm tones that really calmed me down as I step in.    Location - It may seem a little out of the way from the bustling streets of Orchard Road but I love the getaway from the noise and buzz of the constant city life in Singapore. Motorcycle and cars enjoy complimentary parking which is great. You can leave your vehicle indoors while exploring the Fort Canning Park or simply taking a stroll to Plaza Singapura nearby.

Great 5 Star Hotel in Singapore,markhoman1962,"This was my second stay at Fort Canning Hotel, it did not disappoint. This hotel is set only half a mile or so from Clark Quay but is located in beautiful gardens high above the city below, in a busy bustling city this hotel is a quiet fabulous hotel to get some peaceful rest. Great breakfast, superb rooms with excellent sunken baths in most rooms. I've tried many five star hotels in Singapore and fir value this is by far the best, my next venue when in Singapore",5
Nice hotel,caroler160,"This is a charming hotel with good breakfast, very professionnal services, great pool, and nice room. The bed is very comfortable but if you want to go anywhere, you need to take the metro. It is not a big problem because in Singapore the MRT is great. Just so you are aware of it. The hotel is beside a magnific Park, so to mee it is more important than the rest.",4
Historic hotel in city Park,BSAP,"The Hotel is ideally situated in the Fort Canning Park.  The building it’s self is a clean stylish boutique hotel, which provides a wonder international breakfast buffet making a perfect start to your holiday.  If you are interested in history this places is was the Administrative HQ for British during the Battle for Singapore and is metres from the command underground Battle Box museum.",5
Customer service could be better,CW,"I was there for a lunch wedding reception, and although the experience wasn't terrible, service was really only average and below. Don't get me wrong, some staff were genuine and sincere, whilst most others... Unfortunately weren't.   I'm fully aware that banquet staff are mostly made up of freelancers and temporary staff but I guess when you fill majority of banquet staff on freelancers, you can't expect quality. Which unfortunately represents the hotel.  That being said, there were some banquet staff who were actually really good. One in particular offered me a drink while at the cocktail reception, unfortunately my husband and I happen to be standing at the half of the event where apparently was not the wedding reception (half the hall was for the wedding reception while the…",3
Sleek yet charming,AVYYL,"My room had a unique lay out, the desk was the first thing you see when you walk in, with the bed just behind it in the middle of the room. This made the room nice and cosy - the toilet is one of the nicest I've seen in a hotel. Clean and spacious bathtub was perfect for relaxing in after a long day at meetings, and the view of the park outside the floor to ceiling toilet windows was an added bonus.  Staff were friendly and helpful, and the meeting area facilities located in the glass house were clean and on top of being very meeting appropriate, added an extra element of ""nature"" which created a more relaxed atmosphere. It was nice to be surrounded by so much greenery and nature in this hotel, yet still be within walking distance to Clark Quay, which was perfect for post…",5
A very different Singapore hotel,lolandlal,"We will be back! Loved the grand scale colonial architecture, very easy access to the truly wonderful Fort Canning Park and generally great location. The room, swimming pool and free evening drinks were also ok. Breakfast is just passable after you work out where everything is, and how to get an average coffee out of the not very user friendly coffee machine. Staff are rare but great when you need them. Airconditioning is a bit stale and general upkeep is starting to fail.",4
nothing special,Ibosio,"I staying there because I got a very good rate for Singapore. Frankly speaking, although in Singapore everything is close by, I do not really get the point to choose again this hotel  Reception is very basic and not delivering a sense of premium.

Great Staycation,canxnat,"I booked a deluxe room to celebrate the anniversary with my husband. The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained.

It does felt recharged and as if we were out of the town for a couple of days.",5
Very nice property and staff,Dean B,"Stayed here with my gf on our way back to Australia from KL. We chose this place as it seemed the nicest out of the higher priced and nice hotels in Singapore.  Check in and check out were good. Staff were nice and professional.  There was one hour free happy hour with wine and bubbly with tiny & yummy canapes.  Umbrellas were provided on borrow for the rainy days.  The rooms were beautiful and toilets/ bathroom very nice. I guess the only issue was that the guests were advised that the water was going to be shut off for maintenance on our last night between 2:30am and 4 or 5. We were out on orchard road until 3, came back and wanted to wash off the smokey stench. Guess what? There was water but at a very low pressure...our fault for staying our late! Breakfast was very nice and…",5
Great stay with free bar for an hour,Kaye M,"Amazing deluxe rooms, great service and fab staff!! Highly recommend a stay as Clarke quay is close by, get a taxi as the walk up the hill to the hotel is a good one if you don't like the humidity. Free drinks and canapés not to be missed 6-7pm",4
Unexpected haven in Singapore,Kiwiontour_50,"It is been more than 20 years since I was in Singapore so I was looking forward to seeing the city again but a little bit nervous that the hotels might be a little soul-less but not so Hotel Fort Canning. Nestled in parklike surroundings on the hill it was a little haven in the bustling city. The rooms were comfortable and modern, the staff very friendly and facilities excellent. Was impressed by the conference facilities and also took advantage of the spa. Would certainly return for a longer trip next time.",5
Awesome room and service ,Nur Asrina  S,"Stayed for the second time at the hotel. Love the room as we had easy access to the pool. The service and staff were good and friendly. Only one thing is the shower door needs some fixing, cause whenever anyone shower the toilet will get flooded. Will definitely book again.",4
HAUNTED!,Icytoes,"Really lovely hotel..great staff..fabulous pool areas. A perfect place to get away from it all..but.. Yes folks..Seriously Haunted! So,for those that would like to experience a spirit incident..look no further!!!",4
It could have been perfect BUT ... some clientele left a lot to be desired.,Xen_Paul,"My husband and I have wanted to stay at this Hotel for years. On our most recent trip to Singapore we booked in for three nights. Check-in was smooth and the staff were very helpful. The room overlooked the city which was lovely. It was pretty clean (not sparkling) and almost well appointed. There is an acute lack of towel rails or hangers in the bathroom for example. But I can live with that. However on our first full day there I was subjected to the most unsavoury behaviour from the guests in the room across the hall. In fact the entire floor could have heard them. I eventually called the front desk to complain as I felt as though I was staying in a brothel. The poor young man who came to ""investigate"" was awfully embarrassed. I believe the matter was attended to however we…",3
Nice room nice people,Nick Y,Cosy couple stay for 1 night and the missus is already asking when can we go back.  Had a deluxe room with balcony and the decor is amazing. The bathtub is an open concept and so so amazing.  Looks like we are going back again....,5
Stop over from Europe ,Chris v,"My first stay, but certainly not my last. Everything works at Fort Canning! The warm personal welcome, the perfect pillows, the quiet, historical surroundings, the food, the pool, the closeness of the RMT station and Clarke Quay...... I cannot fault this place.  To quote a famous philosopher: ""I'll be back"". ",5
Cosy Stay,Theona L,"We had a cosy stay in the hotel for 4 nights. Viewing the Fort Canning Park from the room was very soothing. It worths staying in the room for some time during the day to enjoy some peaceful moments. Convenient to walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT within 8min. The bed was big and comfortable. Bathroom is very big. Soundprooof is very good too. One shortcoming is that the air conditioning is set to 23 deg cel maximum which could be quite cold at some point. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Hotel Fort Canning and will recommend to our family and friends.",4
If Singapore then Fort Canning,ReDirk,We only had a cup of coffee there after a visit of The Battle Box ... but next time in Singapore we will stay there ... old and new times in one place ... Nice and clam...great pool ... easy walk to the more busy places. Check it out.,5
Expensive compared with may other hotels in Singapore of same category.,O W,"Looks nice from the lobby. Room and especially bathroom nice although it needs some maintenance/cleaning especially the wooden and glass parts. Restaurant and service not to the standard of the hotel. Terraces at main level, restaurant and bar not maintained or cleaned very often.",3
Gem in the city,Yewwenming,"Overall, the ambience, view and atmosphere was great. Staying there was like a getaway out of the country. Enjoyed it.  Only thing that disappointed was that quality of the  breakfast buffet was so much more better than the ala-carte menus ordered during lunch.",5
Pure elegance amongst preserved history,MidgieTich,"What a lovely hotel. The restoration of this hotel is sympathetic to its history and strikes the minute you enter the lobby with the glass floor over the archaelogical dig. The colonial staircases and windows for each room have been beautifully retained. Having once lived in Singapore we wanted to enjoy the forest view. It was a green and peaceful outlook. Staff were very helpful and our premium room with a sitting area and study and stunning bathroom was opulent to say the least. A 10 min walk to the MRT and Plaza Singapura, but plenty of taxis called if needed. 2 outstanding pools and the lack of chlorine was brilliant. I have always wanted to stay here, having first visited Singapore in 1992 as a backpacker who stayed across the street at the YWCA and who had always admired…",5
Beautiful hotel ,Rozana Y,"I set foot in Hotel Fort Canning to attend a conference being held at the venue. My first impression of the hotel upon entering the doors was how much charm it had and I was amazed seeing the historical artifacts in the glass showcase under my feet as I approached the reception. My check in was seamless and the staff handling my check in explained to me that the hotel used to be a club house. He then proceeded to show me to my room and  I appreciated how he took interest where I was from and made other small yet meaningful talk as we approached my room. I was amazed with the room layout and the modern facilities and was convinced that I would have a good night’s sleep. Despite it not being a halal certified hotel, I had many food options of seafood and vegetarian at the buffet…",4
Luxurious hotel,Quin Z,What I really liked about this hotel is the unique bathroom design that oversees the hill and the rooms are spacious. Having a bath in the bathtub and looking out of the window makes the stay super worthwhile.  The staff service is also awesome. It was my husband's birthday and they sent a complimentary cake to the room.   I will definitely love to stay here again.,5
Peaceful elegance,40South R&R,Great hotel with a nice ambience. Surrounded by a park so quiet and no traffic fumes. Walk out the front and 10 minutes to Orchard Road shopping ...and  walk out the back through the park to Clarke Quay in 15 minutes.  Great pool area and 6pm catch up for guests each evening with wines and nibbles.,4
No problems with hardware but fails on hospitality,TimFP,"1. The hotel grounds are gorgeous and the location/setting is unique, being right smack in the city but surrounded by lush greenery of Fort Canning Park on the top of a small hill. In terms of setting, the only comparable hotels in Singapore are the Shangrila and the resort hotels in Sentosa.  2. It is best to use a cab when getting to the hotel. Presently there is alot of construction work blocking off easy walking access from both Fort Canning MRT and Dhoby Gaut MRT. Parts of Fort Canning Park was also blocked off for renovation works.  3. We stayed in the Deluxe room which was spacious, well-appointed, and comfortable. I like the design of the hotel room (and also the common areas) which mix modern and colonial styles with good use of technology. The comments I have with…",3
Delightful stay,Gillian W,"We had an enjoyable stay at Hotel Fort Canning: staff friendly and helpful, historic feel to the building, great swimming pools and the best night’s sleep in a hotel for years!  (We turned the air-con off, it was a good temperature and very quiet!)   Once we found a good way to the nearest railway station it was very easy to get around Singapore.   Would happily stay again.

Great hotel in Singapore,kevbay,"This really is a gem of a hotel. Great pools, comfortable and spacious rooms, well mine was anyway. Bar service can be a little slow.

Wedding Anniversary,densut2018,"I decided to surprise my wife by spending our 32nd wedding anniversary in Singapore. I was not looking for 'another' hotel experience so researched and found Hotel Fort Canning, which looked to be a taste of old school luxury. On arrival, we were very impressed by the classic foyer, although the reception are was a little obscure, we found it very quickly and as there were already people booking in, we were invited to wine and canapés while we waited. Shown to our room, we were asked to close our eyes before entering the room, once we could open them, we were very impressed by the ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the bed and the quality of the room itself. Over the next 5 days, we were constantly impressed by the facilities, the room and especially the staff. Next to Singapore,…",5

Dishonest hotel & Poor service recovery ,Lim T,"The reservation manager, Maggie Chow just charged an extra roll-away bed $94.16 to my card due to me adding on breakfast for 3pax. She claimed it was an accidental deduction. Later she gave herself away that it was done just so that she can secure the triple occupancy rate!! Even after I told her the 3th person is just joining us the next day.    Her service recovery was just to offer us a greenery view which makes no sense when HFC is situated in a hilly area. When asked what she can offer for my sis 21st, she said the Front office stay will present us a cake. I rejected as I will also be buying cake.why waste food resources.l Asked for other alternative (a glass of champagne or even F&B vouchers) but got rejected again.

Below my expectation..,Cynthia F,"This is a scenic, heritage hotel standing in the midst of the historical fort canning park. The staffs are friendly and helpful.  However this hotel is some what over rated. The Deluxe Garden Room toilet has toilet and shower adjacent to one another in the living room itself with a sharing glass panel door, opening one will close the other side. Toilet is so small it can hardly fit an adult with the glass door closed, not to mention exposing the person showering beside, freezing in the cold room. Smell does seep into the entire room when one is doing activity in the toilet. Bath tub is right in the room beside the bed. Weird concept. Complimentary 6 nespresso capsules and TWG tea bags to offer. Comfortable bed.  Breakfast is below average. Limited variety and nothing worth…",3
Great service from staff,pigmoon,"The staff were all so friendly and ready to serve us as and when we arrive. No 'tunnel-visioned' staff or ones who would look away. They are so prompt and keen to serve all the time. It is amazing!!   The only area of improvement is probably the design of the bathroom because the water flows into the living space through the door gap, making the threshold a bit untidy to walk through after a shower. But all in all, the place is fantastic!!!",4
Lovely Hotel,Elenischoice,"Perfect for us and wish we had been staying longer. Staff were so helpful and delightful, our room was clean and spacious, the bed comfortable, the position central but in gardens, the pool great for exercise, and breakfast varied and generous. Would love to stay again! ",5
Colonial splendour in Singapore,KewVish,"Singapore for a tourist is intense, buzzy, busy and fun. The small sleepy fishing village and then the British colonial outpost that it started its life as is visible only in brief glimpses of  an old ‘black and white’ house here, or an old man pushing a cart there. But what you mostly get is a modern, smart and efficient city of skyscrapers. Sort of like a Dubai but with a million trees. Walk down the ‘river’ from Marina Bay through Raffles Place and Clarke Quay to Robertson Quay and you pass a succession of restaurants and bars serving you every cuisine in the world. When its busy, which is almost always, it seems half the world is there enjoying themselves. And in the night Clarke Quay and its surrounds transform into a giant party place. Great if you want to go pubbing and…",5
Wonderfully memorable service,Chris L,"This is a quaint but charming colonial hideaway in the heart of the city. I had the privilege of spending my partner’s birthday here, and the team at fort canning were wonderfully proactive and accommodating to all of our requests — with a cake and lighted candles as a surprise! (We also got a free upgrade to a premier king room too) This is also a definitely romantic place, especially with the open concept bath in the room. The breakfast was not too bad too - can recommend the live station’s eggs Benedict and pancakes that are made to order. The rooms furnishings are also pretty plush and the pillow menu was definitely good as well. Free drinks in the lobby were a nice touch too.  The staff were the true highlight here, always going the extra mile for their guests. Always…",5
Mum's 70th birthday Made More Memorable At Hotel Fort Canning (Hfc) ,PrincessCathie,"Last year, I brought my rarely widowed mum to Hfc for staycation cum 69th BD. Recently, when I asked if she was keen to come by the same place for staycation, she was overjoyed. She even remembered the wrong date (08 Aug instead of 09 Aug). I am totally thankful that since I stepped into Hfc in 2009, Hfc has never failed to Wow me. The reservations manager, Ms Maggie Chow, was prompt prompt to reply me for my various requests prior to the trip. I was blessed by The assistant front desk manager, Mr Kelson Yeo, who remembered my staycation  back in Mar 2016 when I celebrated my 21st wedding anniversary with my hubby who was struck with sudden hearing loss after the raw fish saga in Nov 2015. I was granted not just an early check-in of 1pm, but Mr Kelson surprised me with a…",5
Peaceful,TanteTrish,"Attentive and courteous service. Lovely location. Great pool water! The evening (6-7pm) free drinks in the lounge for guests is a nice touch. If your flight is later than checkout time, HFC will not only hold your luggage for you, but give you access to their facilities to shower/freshen-up before you fly out. Air-con was a bit noisier than I prefer.",5
Beautiful Hotel,Joanne D,"This is a beautiful hotel which looks just like the pictures. It’s in a great location just a short stroll from Fort Canning MRT.  The rooms are lovely although ours was a little small (we had the deluxe room). The room didn’t have much hanging space for clothes and I would have expected bath robes to be provided together with an iron and ironing board. These can be requested from housekeeping.  I was also surprised by the quality of bath towels.  I expected lovely fluffy towels but ours were rather warn.  Other than that I couldn’t fault the hotel, the staff were wonderful and the free drinks from 6-7pm was a lovely surprise. I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to couples travelling with out kids.",5
Lovely stay here,Emsle,Pros: In the heart of the city as well as lush greenery. The glass windows in the bathroom gave us a beautiful view of fresh foliage. We enjoyed the pool and the room greatly.   Cons: Quite a number of flying insects in the room. We had requested for two twin beds which was given to us but they were placed right by each other which essentially made it a king bed.,5
Club membership,agong4,"Hotel Fort Canning is home to the Legends Fort Canning Park Club members. Members enjoy an entire floor of members area which include reading / TV lounge, card rooms, Karaoke rooms and Changing room. Members enjoy unlimited use of the Gym and swimming pool.   Gym: Modern equipment in good condition. The gym is seldom packed. Most of the time, there are only 2-3 other gymers when I visit. This is it's main attraction. Privacy and quietness.   Swimming pool: Mineral pool they called it. Means less harmful chlorine to destroy your hair and skin. Pools are usually empty except mozzies will keep you company at night. In the day, it's a nice place to chill. The only thing I don't like about it is the access to the changing room. You might be caught in an awkward situation where you…",5

Great Hotel & Staff in fantastic location,Roger C,"Fort Canning Hotel is in a very good location in a beautiful park yet is close enough to either walk or use a couple of MRT stations so that you can easily reach all the parts of the city.  The staff were wonderful, rooms clean and breakfast was a very good selection. Lovely swimming pools and gym.  We are already planning our next visit!",5
Nice combination of class and friendly staff hotel with a palace like rooms. ,Dr K,"The rooms are kinda spacious with palace like high ceiling. Gives a feel of royalty.  Staff are friendly and very helpful to the best of their ability. Internet speed is not the highest in town yet, the management said they are working on a competitive improvement.  Variety of food at breakfast is determined by the size of the buffet.   Overall, the hotel is worth spending time in. ",5
hotel fort canning (deluxe king room),xmickeyxmkx,staff was super friendly and helpful. supposed to check in at 3pm but they let us check in as soon as the room was available. i love the atmosphere of the hotel generally. it’s really quiet and relaxing! highly recommended and will definitely come back again :),5
It was nice to return,JoeA3,"The staff here are wonderful. Vinash and Kelson in front office, Jenny, Kumar, Ruby and Erica in the dining room and bar and Doris and her team in housekeeping.

A classy experience,Brian D,We stayed in this hotel for 5 days.  The experience was really impressive.  The room was beautifully presented and very clean.  Everything worked.  The checkin experience was outstanding as Ivana checked us in and then took us to our room and made sure all was in place.  The food here was outstanding.  The restaurant was superb with excellent service and great food.  We had breakfast and dinner here on most days and were never disappointed with the variety and the quality of the food.  The hotel is set within a wonderful park which allows for walks and peace.  A short walk down the hill and you are in the centre of everything with easy access to the MRT train service which takes you everywhere in Singapore.  I cannot emphasise too much how good the staff are here.  They are…,5
Wonderful Experience!,k_rajah,"The hotel staffs are very attentive. I like it when all the staff regardless of just the maintenance staff, takes the initiatives to great you along the corridor.

Wonderful bit of history in a beautiful location ,NZMidds,"What makes Hotel Fort Canning different from other inner city hotels is where its situated. You feel like your in a tropical oasis away from the hustle and noise of the city- but actually right on the door step.  It’s a wonderfully historic building that is steeped in WWII history. The park around it offers lots to explore. The pools are amazing, especially if you have kids. They are huge and so nice to soak in when he heat is on. Out teenagers spent hours in the pools at the end of long days on their feet in the heat.  Location wise your about 7-10 minutes from the MTS stations at Fort Canning or Dhoby. Both are easy enough walks, but the hotel is on a hill so there are stairs and some step bits. If you can’t handle a short walk in the heat then take a cab. With the MTS on your…",5
Poorly designed room with equally poor service,H_Zhang,"Stayed one night at the hotel. My room is on the 1st floor. The room is poorly designed. The bathtub sits 1.5 meters away from the bed and there is nothing in between, which means splashed water can easily hit your bed. The washing basin is adjacent to the luggage counter. You need to be careful when washing your hands or face. Otherwise, you will get water on your luggage. Another main problem is the lack of charging outlets. To my surprise, all power outlets are occupied, implying that you have to unplug some in order to charge your phone. Given the popularity of mobile phones, this is a weird arrangement. Service is equally poor. I checked in at 11 pm and asked for a late check-out. The receptionist asked me to call again next morning. So I did and I didn't get any…",2

A case stand would have been a nice addition",4
Relaxing oasis in the centre of Singapore,Angela,"I felt the staff here were more of a family and they were all very pleasant and professional, adding to the colonial charm of the hotel.  It was so restful to look out on the park and many large trees and even more so because, thankfully, there were few children staying and those that were there, were well behaved and quiet.   ",5
Fantastic Hotel,Russell E,"Stayed at Hotel Fort Canning in March for a week, had a wonderful time and the Hotel and staff are excellent. It’s quite a unique location being situated in the Park, with lots of history and lovely and interesting walks. It is a bit of way to the main Singapore attractions but great walking routes and taxi’s are quite cheap, if needed.   We really liked our room with the great bathroom that has floor to ceiling glass but there are blinds that can be used as well. The swimming pools are amazing and so clean! We ate in the hotel a couple of times and had really nice meals but Singapore has such a great choice of good quality restaurants to suit all budgets that you have to venture out and try them.   A really nice touch from the Hotel is that each evening they provide…",5
historical building with all modern comfort,Fabien M,Had a great stay. More interesting than most other hotels in Singapore because of the historical building and the location both a stonethrow away and secluded from buzzing downtown. Will try to return there.,5
Terrible management Beautiful Property,Angelm777,"The hotel is lovely with comfortable rooms and great amenities. However, the management, guest relations and house keeping are below standard. The only professional and helpful person on the team was Vinash at the front desk. His hospitality was incredible as not only was he helpful but went beyond to deliver us a charger I had left in the room. For me he was the star while others were not what i would expect from a 5 star hotel. The housekeeping was noisy at 7 am jn morning with constant chatting on their cell and alert sounds waking us up. The concierge service, and the guest relationship manager could not give two hoots when i complained. They preferred to ignore it and send me a mail two days later to apologize. I would expect a luxury hotel management to immediately pick up…",2
Great Service!,mabelboo,The amenities are great!  The guest relation officer is all very friendly and helpful. Will definitely recommend my friends for a stay here.

Easy our best choice ,Chris Hoath,"This place is perfect. Clean, really well appointed, spacious contemporary rooms with excellent staff. Complimentary wine and canopies every night and a magnificent warm open air swimming pool to wind down in. Walking distance to two MRT stations which means access to everywhere. I love this hotel and will return many times. ",5
Beautiful and peaceful place in a great city,Juergen Noack,"Unbelievable but true: this is such a beautiful hotel, located i a very beautiful park within the center of Singapore. The surrounding park was a important place in the early days because it is one of the highest natural points and so Mr. Raffles could oversee the ships coming into the harbour. Back to the hotel: Service is great and also the food. Everything is very clean and stylish. On our last day we could stay after checkout at the poolside and we enjoyed it very much! Thank you for this occation.",5
Great for that price,Yegor S,"Very good hotel for that price in general. It is situated near Clarke Quay in the beautiful green park. We liked to walk there in the evening. But it is on hill so be sure you like to walk :-). Rooms are small but with all in it and even little more (for instance coffe-machine, big cupboard, both shower and bath, free phone) and great scenery view from your room.  What we don't like: 1) All our pillows smell bad 2) Very thin walls - we hear our neighbors when they speak with each other or by phone 3) There is no exhaust ventilation in the bathroom and as result there is an unpleasant smell of dampness.",5
"Beautiful location, lovely staff",MaryJoyCanberra,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for 6 nights. The staff were all amazing - helpful in every way. The location of the hotel is excellent - very close to a number of MRT stations.  But - as a former fort it is on top of a hill, so there are some steepish steps up if you are walking. It is a great place to stay that is not right in the bustle of the city, but very close to it (Clarke Quay is about a 7 minute walk)",5
Excellent Staycation,wanshah7167,Checked-in for one night on the 7th of July to have a mini celebration of my wife birthday with my kids.

The entrance to the room opens into the living area with a sofa and TV.  This is also where the mini bar and a Nespresso machine are placed.  Good to note that the sofa set provided can be deployed into a sofa bed if needed.  Going thru another door in the living area will bring you into the bedroom proper.  The room is of a good size and has the access to a small balcony.

Our Premium Room had lots of space and very luxurious, we used the coffee pod machine every day. Staff were very helpful. Enjoyed the huge choice for breakfast and had a lovely high tea. The central location was a short walking distance to Clarke Quay and 2 MRT stations. This is now our favorite hotel.",5
Excellent hotel,RyanA94,"I stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning for 2 nights earlier this year.   This is one of my favourite hotels in Singapore. It is located at the Fort Canning Park - a quiet park near the city. The hotel is just a few minutes walk away from the busy Orchard Road shopping district and the nightlife scene at Clarke Quay.   The building that currently houses the hotel used to be a British military headquarters/barracks. The rooms were modern and spacious. I loved the bathroom. The bathroom is located at the balcony area of the room. There is a level of openness while ensuring privacy. Fret not, no one would be able to look into your bathroom from outside.   The hotel also provides free wine and small bites in the evening at the lounge in the lobby.   In sum, this is a great hotel. I would…",5
Secluded location that makes for a great break,Wander,"We came to the hotel about 2pm (1 hr earlier than the check-in time) on a Saturday, 30 Jun 2018. My young child was sleeping in my arms and we were contented to sit and wait in their lobby.   However, the lady at the counter managed to have our room ready and walked us to our room in no time.   This was in contrast to the phone conversation earlier in the day with the reservations side which was more curt and more of ""there's no room available."" Which i thought was quite odd for Hotel Fort Canning's standards, perhaps the phone conversations could be something the hotel can look into.  The Hotel is a beautiful combination of colonial, yet our room was superbly clean, and very modern. Our girl was extremely excited at the hot tub. Loved how our bed faced the sky outside and we…",5
Amazing Getaway,Nigellau,"I stayed a night at the deluxe garden room with my girlfriend. The staff were very polite and had very good service.

Wonderful Hotel,Andy S,"We stayed at the hotel for just one night, unfortunately. I would have loved to have stayed longer as its such a nice place. Its an old Colonial building that has been modernised internally without loosing its old world charm and appeal. The rooms are very spacious, light and airy but have all the ""mod cons"" of a new hotel. The staff are very nice, friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location is also a big bonus as it sits in Fort Canning Park which is a beautiful place and an easy walk down to The City, Clarke Quay or The Bay. Hopefully i'll get to return to Singapore one day and stay in this hotel again.",5
Outstanding!  Planning to come back!,K T,"This place picked me up with their welcoming, kind, helpful, respectful and caring staff.  Every single one of them deserves commendation.  The surrounds were like a beautiful, peaceful oasis and the room was stunning.  The food selections were wonderful, delicious and delightfully presented.  The cleaning was of the highest standard.  I stayed at HFC because of a conference at the same venue.  It was my first trip overseas and I had to come by myself so I was quite overwhelmed, especially after I had endured a grueling week before leaving my country.  This place so impressed me that I am planning to bring my family here for our first family trip overseas.",5
Very nice experience,medchev,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hotel Fort Canning! The front desk staff was great; they answered all my questions and requests promptly.   I would make one small recommendation: As I was packing my things yesterday to checkout, one of my items fell and rolled under the bed. As I retrieved, I notice some dust and a pair of slippers under the bed. The cleaning staff must make a point of cleaning under the bed each time a guest checks out so the next guest will start from a really clean room.  Other than the above, I look forward to staying again at HFC. Lovely hotel in a lovely location.",4

The hotel is located in the Fort Canning park with trees all around and lovely walking trails but close to the MRT, Clark Quay etc.  The building was converted from a colonial British military headquarters and maintains the look.  The pool is one of best I have ever used; the temperature is perfect and the setting is great with trees.  There is also a lap pool.  The gym is in a separate building and has good equipment.  Breakfast has a good variety and a chef will prepare eggs as you like.  The restaurant is surprisingly good and not over priced.  There are often weddings or other functions at the hotel but they do not interfere or distract from the stay.",5

It was of a good size, very well maintained, high ceilings with a nice bathtub to chill in. Only dissatisfaction with the room was the dirty and dusty window. Breakfast was enjoyable, not a wide spread but quality wise was good. I would suggest tourists to just try the hotel breakfast for a day and head out to try our local food for the remaining days. Amenities and service wise, we expected more of a 5 star hotel. We felt that the hotel amenities require some up-keeping and cleanliness can be improved too.

Most of staff speak english and are all too easy to please and to make your stay an enjoyable one. Built in 1926 as the HQ for the British Far East Command it is a grand building with much history and now refurbished into a hotel. I particularly liked the free mobile phone in the room which has free local and international calls for your convenience, great for checking on the kids at home and at work from time to time. The location is great just a 15 min walk to Dhobi Ghat MRT and the Plaza Singapura Shops. I will definitely be staying here again and will recommend it to my family and friends.",5

The pools are lovely. The breakfast is excellent, with plenty of Asian and western food.  The only thing that could be improved is the soundproofing to the corridors. Not that there’s much happening there, but one hears everything that goes on. The staff were very helpful and tried to assist in every way.

Long weekend stay,Jonni1972,Hotel Fort Canning lived up to all expectations for our stay and was value for money for a boutique luxury hotel in central Singapore. Excellent customer service and attention to detail by their staff from all areas in the hotel was a standout for us. Nothing was too much trouble and they really made us feel as though we were guests in their home. Rooms were comfortable and modern but the only negative here is the room sizes are small. But that may have to do with the layout of the old historic building. But it still would not deter us coming back on a regular basis. The restaurant was very good.

nice neighbourhood but noisey,youke_worldwide,So this property is quite nice as it looks over fort canning and it Is a old colonial property. We did not use any facilities but came to enjoy the area. We got a free upgrade into the suite which was very nice. However there was a wedding there and they were very noisy even late at night and they sort of took over the entire premise. From the room on the second floor there was also constant people peeking in from the hill itself. would have been very nice and romantic without these interruptions,4
Good hotel,Gavlauek,Our experience at Fort Canning Hotel was pleasant and a very good experience. The room is clean and the bed is very comfortable. I would say the breakfast has a wide variety and it’s tasty! Highly recommend,5
"Amazing Hotel, amazing service",Shen_Li1403,"I booked the hotel for a 3D2N Staycation to celebrate my partner's birthday.   Hotel room is great! Very nicely done, bathtub size is good, room was cozy and most importantly clean. Parking is also free! We loved the swimming pools, they have 2 in the hotel and it was one of the biggest we had been. Just one point to note was the sound proof of the room is not that fantastic but it did not affect much of our stay.  Service was really awesome. I've stayed at a few 5* hotels before and I would say they have one of the best service here. FOH take you personally to your room, showing you where is the restaurant to have your breakfast, directions and instructions of how the room functions are very clear. They take note into small details of the guests staying there. Hotel staff knows…",5
Great strategic location,Kevin D,"Positioned on the high ground above the urban sprawl.  The wife and I made full use of the surrounding parklands, walking and running the various tracks that encircle the hill.  Peppered throughout  are cultural and historical points of interest.  We did kick back as well enjoying the pools and evening soaks in the bath, cause we could. Oh and the Battlebox underground bunker tour is there also.  Great food, Great accommodation. Walk, bike or hop on hop off bus sites nearby...it's Singapore not much is that far away",5
Dirty sheets and dirty toilet,Abby C,We checked into our room after a long trip to find dirty sheets and urine on the toilet.  The hotel acted like they wanted to help but never resolved the issue. They downgraded our room but charged us the higher rate.  We we're so frustrated.  We thought as conference attendees we would get better treatment.,1
Charming colonial hotel,Aliah91,"I booked the deluxe garden room to celebrate my partner’s birthday. The room was spacious and clean. We enjoyed the outdoor space in the patio but the highlight of the room would be the lovely bathtub. The lighting made the tub look more impressive than expected. The staff were friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating in assisting me with the birthday surprise for my partner. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for guests looking for a place away from the concrete jungle, wanting to immerse themselves in lush greenery, and of course to have a romantic stay with their partner. ",5
"Great, central parkland location - the best of both worlds.",Murray I,"The parkland location comes with much history and the Hotel itself is well designed to create a friendly and relaxing atmosphere. All staff  were very willing to assist us with our queries about what to do in Singapore on a short visit.  We found the parkland picturesque and a pleasure to wander through, the pool ares were extremely well presented (with pools to meet all needs) and the bar & dining areas relaxing and friendly.  The Hotel's central location meant it was only a short taxi ride to most of the tourist spots, and with the humidity in Singapore that is the go.  Our only disappointment was that we only had a couple of days to enjoy what  this excellent Hotel has to offer.  We look forward to staying at Hotel Fort Canning longer, on our next visit.",5
A haven in the centre of Singapore,Kiwiontour_50,"I came here for a conference but it was also a chance to sample the wonderful hospitality of the hotel staff. Without exception everyone was helpful smiling and eager to help, from the airport transfer to the front office staff, housekeeping and the restaurant. I also managed to squeeze in a relaxing spa.  The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. All that you would expect from a top class hotel. The hill on which Hotel Fort Canning sits provides a beautiful park like garden that makes you forget that you’re in the middle of one of the worlds most crowded cities, though the city scape peaks through. A little walk to the main attractions can be a bit off putting in the steamy heat but every building has aircon so you can find relief. I could only stay for a few days but will…",5
Very romantic place for someone you're *really* comfortable with,sillygator,"The rooms may be smaller than they appear in the pictures, but the layout tries to make as much space available as possible. In our Garden Patio room the shower and the toilet feature a sliding glass door which closes off only one of those spaces at a time. The glass door, while offering to conceal certain areas with strategically placed diffusion tape, instead offers an abstract show at times, as the shower and toilet lights are effectively spotlights illuminating the subject (willing or unwilling). But don't get me wrong; this is all good fun for a romantic time with someone you're *really* comfortable with. If not, it could get ugly fast. The service was great; when we wanted to be left alone we put the DND on, and housekeeping would slip a note under the door letting us know…",3
First visit to Singapore,Steve M,"Great location, super swimming pools, good restaurant with a mixture of eastern and western foods, good breakfast with plenty of choice. Set in a beautiful park, above the city, feels cooler than down in the city.",4
Luxury country club in the city ,JonRees,Enjoyed several in a great room thanks to kelsan over looking to pool. Rom facilities where all of the highest order. Evening drinks reception was well attended and broke the ice with other guests. More of a club than hotel. Location was great with short walk into town or metro. Had a great singapore sling over looking the city.,5
Wow amazing hotel,Christina B,Arrived here for 5 nights and was blown away by this hotel. Our room was suburb and I loved the pools.   the pre dinner drinks offered each night was awesome . All the  staff were fabulous. Special mention to Ruby at the bar who made a terrific Singapore sling!! And to Kumar the f&b manager who solved one issue we had in minutes . Thank you . Will be back one day ,5
Top spot in Singapore,Neil B,"The Fort Canning hotel was amazing, set in beautiful gardens it was quiet, had old- world charm and all the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Loved the entire stay and would recommend it.",5
Superlative ' SIOUX' Singapore Services @ FCL,800kevin,We were treated like Royalty with professional and personable attention to every minor  services detail. Nothing to small to please ...  No meals but the get together after 6 pm is a Must . Met such well travelled souls and all in the zone to share experiences.  Suggestion : a Vivaldi 4 seasons concerto accompaniment when the Roman blinds open up the Day for  you at the touch control bedside . Heavenly ...  Room 343 is a haven of peace and tranquility . Seeing a Singapore Thunderstorm 'unfold'  as you luxuriate in the Julius Caesar Bath (!) overlooking the madding crowds ignoble strife ... in the far distance ............. PRICELESS !   Pool side a haven of Tranquility and spaciousness ..    My isnt  ArnieS ! ( ;-)  but we WILL be Back .  AS Singaporeans say SIOUX,5
Charming Hotel,Puddy78,"My husband and I stayed here for theee nights and had a thoroughly pleasant experience. Our room was lovely and spacious with a very comfortable bed. The hotel location, being away from the hustle and bustle of the city made for a quiet and relaxing stay. Breakfast was very good with lots of variety on offer. The complimentary drinks available in the evening was also a nice touch. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would return.",4
Very good hotel,GuenterD1980,"Altogether the two nights spent at Fort Canning Hotel were a very positive experience. The rooms are spacious, modern and stylish, beds are huge and very comfortable. The showers and toilets follow a very open room concept. Maybe a bit too much so but that is a matter of taste. The rooms have a significant lack of power outlets so charging phones and cameras was a bit tricky. We had the Feeling that the room was altogether a bit too much built for style over practicality. Pool area is nice and well kept. We liked that the area is altogether pretty quiet.",4
Long Weekend ,fishbit69,"Enjoyed our stay here recently however food quality in the restaurant needs to improve. When paying over $100 for 3 pax for breakfast I feel it was mediocre at best. Each day i ordered cooked breakfast and food was just warm. Please try serving food on hot plates. Also I wanted to try eggs Benedict which I love but the a la carte breakfast I got on Monday morning April 29, was unsatisfactory. Hollandaise sauce was thin and watery not thick thick and velvety and coating the eggs as it should be. Hash browns were cold not crispy and looked like they had been taken from the buffet. If going to charge these prices then please get the basics right!   Room was clean and beds comfortable. Bar and happy hour was nice together with attentive staff. Love the coffee machine in the room and…",3
Nice but could be better,Chowder,"The location of HFC is great as Fort Canning is right at the doorstep and Orchard Road is also within walking distance. The lap pool and gym are both wonderful for those keen on some serious exercise.   A few things however, marred our stay and made it less than satisfying.  The Nespresso machine wasnt working properly and neither was the weighing scale in the bathroom. There was mould on the door of the shower cubicle and some of the towels are beginning to look tired i.e. frayed seams. We asked for extra floor mat and were given bath towels instead. All in all, the housekeeping department needs some polishing up.",3
Beautiful boutique hotel,Simona M,"Hotel Fort Canning is set in a beautiful park a short walk away from Orchard Rd, the rooms are modern and beautiful (connecting rooms available for families)the building is older style (colonial?), the buffet breakfast was amazing with an excellent selection of food and good coffee, the staff are professional and friendly, highly recommend this hotel, would stay there again",5
Overall experience,HL Teo,"I enjoyed my stay there, greeted with friendly staff and serve with complimentary wine tasting in the evening. Very nice view of the room with high ceiling.   However, there were quite limited channels available on the TV and we couldn't project our laptop onto the smart TV.",4
Hotel Fort Canning,Angelyne T,"Nice hotel and we love the room. Was there for hibby birthday celebrations , service was good and thank You so much to the front counter manager and staff for the cake and also souvenir for my little girl.",5
Special occasion ,Melvin T,"Firstly the checking in experience can’t be any worst when I have to wait aimlessly for my turn and was not greeted to be seated and wait for my turn. It was indeed not a welcoming start to this much anticipated staycation on a special occasion.   The room interior was pleasant and definitely much expected. However the edge of the standing shower glass was sighted with big patch of Mould and was unsightly.   Requested for a turn down before I left for my dinner appointment. And return to realize that the curtains were not adjusted and was still high up and given the stars of this hotel, there was no evening or bedtime greetings found to provide that upscale service.   The amenities were limited with only a set of shower and shampoo ( small bottles).   The pool was well…",2
Terrific Hotel,John G,This was the second time I stayed at Hotel Fort Canning.  This year my stay was even more pleasant than last year.  And I will return on my next trip to Singapore.  The setting is beautiful; it's near the city (within walking distance) yet it is located in a beautifully landscaped park.  The rooms are generously proportioned and the bath facilities perfect.,5
"Friendly oasis, close to Fort Canning Park",selkie2018,"Located on the edge of the park with the opportunity to go for walks there. Tastefully modernised  colonial building. Check in was friendly and fast and we could move into our room, even though we were early!  The restaurant serves a mix of international food and Singaporean dishes, which we enjoyed too. MRT (underground) is within walking distance, so all tourist attractions are within easy reach.  An added bonus was that we could not only leave our bags, but also were offered have a shower before going to the airport!  I would definitely stay here again!",5
Wonderful place to stay outside the concrete,schwaabe,"Our second stay in this wonderful old, newly renovated hotel in the green area of Singapur. Fort Canning Parc in the morning for a nice walk before a rich breakfast, free drinks and snacks in the afternoon, friendly and professional staff. Hope, we come back soon!",5
Friendly and accommodating staff; Quick check-in,rlperez2018,"I enjoyed my stay very much.  I particularly love the automatic curtains of the bathroom windows overlooking the garden and bathroom door.  The AC can be controlled via a device by the night stand, which is super customer friendly.    Staff are very friendly and accommodating, easy to talk to since they understand and speak english well.  Even if the entrance of the hotel is not along the main road (located on top of a hill), getting a cab is quite easy with the help of the hotel staff.  Need improvement on water pressure of bidet - too strong, water leakage of bath tub faucet; old smell along the corridors",4
Oasis in Singapore,MaryLouY,"Wonderful location and excellent staff in this tastefully renovated colonial building nestled in extensive forested hillside.  We stayed for 2 nights en route from London to Australia, and stayed close to home- mineral water in pool was totally refreshing; gym equipment free to use. Social drinks and canapés from 6-7 a delight. Our second time here and it did not disappoint.",5
Staycay at Hotel Fort Canning,shirleynyn,"Celebrated my birthday at Hotel Fort Canning. The staffs were friendly and approachable. In addition, it is truly a venue suitable for weddings. Since we went there during the music festival, it was pretty loud even when we’re in our room. We were given a corner room, the room itself was huge. However, the only displease incident that I can pinpoint is that the room’s windows and binds were dirty. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable short staycay.",4
Easter Getaway,Julie H,"Peaceful oasis in beautiful Fort Canning parklands. Lovely room with a gorgeous view of the park. We booked a premium room to ensure that we had a separate bathroom and we were very impressed, loved having an afternoon bath before drinks in the hotel lounge area. Breakfast was simple but more than adequate with an egg station for omelettes etc. The pool area is very relaxing and includes a very good lap pool. A few more lounges and umbrellas would be my only suggestion. The hotel is a very easy walk to Dhoby Ghaut or Fort Canning train stations, yes the hotel is on a hill but it was not a problem for us. One evening we walked from the hotel to Marina Bay via Clark Quay a beautiful walk along the river front. After trying many hotels in Singapore this hotel will now be our hotel…",5
Value for money!,Risa Ad,"I was here with my friends to celebrate our girlfriend's hen's night. Check in was smooth. The FO lady was very soft-spoken and helpful. She offered to help carry our bags which we politely declined as it was not that heavy. She then brought us up to our room and informed us of the room's facilities.  The room was spacious. With the dim lights in the room, the atmosphere is kind of too romantic for us. The bathroom was spacious. With full glass window. Huge mirror next to the bathtub. The only problem we had was with the lock of the bathroom door. It was stuck and requires more force when we want to lock it. The bed was also very comfortable. In-room dining menu was alright. Except that they are slightly over-priced.   Overall, the service was excellent. We had a wonderful…",5
Nice stay in a hidden champion.,manfredvehreschild,"Hotel Fort Canning is a nice place, but obviously not that well known. Even several taxi drivers had some difficulties to find the entrance. Although it is a huge place. The service team is very friendly, the hotel is located in a beautiful park and a bit remote from downtown. Excellent also for functions of any kind. However, to Orchard Street it is just a 5 Min. walk. Rooms are very nice and in a very good shape, Breakfast offers local and international food in a wide variety. And two large pools that are hardly used offer an excellent spot to swim and relax (largest pool I have seen in a hotel for a long time). Unfortunately the bar closes at 10:30 pm. However, we enjoyed our stay at Fort Canning very much so !",5
Great stay over Easter,MHCH42,"Excellent quiet, and spacious,  room - a haven in the park after a day's sightseeing. The free smart phone is a big plus. After a bit of orientation I was able to see everything I wished to using the nearby MRT station. Gratis champagne, wine and canapes for residents in the evening unexpected and well-received. Very good food in the Salon in the evenings with efficient service. Breakfast buffet range not quite what I'd read about in other reviews and a fair bit of traipsing around to the different food/beverage stations. Front of house very focussed and accommodating e.g. early check in, access to wifi. Overall, I'm glad I booked HFC and would certainly return",5
Pleasant and quiet location,Eric J,Away from the hustle and bustle of The city. Quiet location in Fort Canning Park. A bit of a walk to restaurants for dinner. Very helpful and friendly staff. The food at the Evening restaurant needs improvement.,4
WOW,Alan342,"Stayed here for 2 night on a short stopover......Can not fault it.. The Hotel is very modern without ruining the History of it. Could not be in a better location, Set in an absolutely stunning quiet park yet only a 10min walk from the night life of Clark Quay...so impressed we are booking back for next year",5
Beautiful Hotel ,Russ T,"We had a fabulous stay at the Hotel Fort Canning. The room was amazing and spacious , very well designed and huge comfortable bed. The views were great out of the hotel overlooking the park and good location for sightseeing Singapore. The staff were really helpful and made our stay even better. The breakfast was outstanding and we would return again next time we are in Singapore. ",5
"Very nice Hotel, great service, excellent location!!!",Roberto N,"Very high quality/price ratio. Green all around the place and very quite even though very near to the city center;excellent restaurant and breakfast. Personnel friendly and professional; swimming pools, SPA, gym. Nice and clean. I will definitely go back there again!!!",5
Business or Pleasure - Beautiful Location to escape the City,Erin Bowen,I stayed 5 nights for business in March and loved the stay so much returned for a personal holiday/mini-moon in April! The staff were lovely - the escape from the City Hustle and Bustle - love the large rooms - love the relaxed feel about the property - the park on the doorstep. Food and Beverages are reasonably priced .. Love the 6pm drinks that you can meet other guests staying in the property. Will be back as I love this to escape to a natural - relaxed surrounding!,5
We loved the hotel swimming pool: always clean and not crowded. Pool’s water is  like a spring water.,Любимая Л,"Staff was very friendly , but not attentive enought. 1)We had to remind them several times to bring us “ kimono”. It’s kind of dressing gowns. They forget  to leave them  in the room after their cleaning up often. 2)The floor under beds was very dusty . Suddenly I droped my cream under my bed.. So I  was very disapointed with tonnes of dust.   If you ready  to have for a long healthy walk to the nearest metro station you can choose that hotel easily. It took us about 25-30 minutes one way only.",4
Very Disappointing Experience,PConD,"Booked for a one night Staycation. Check in was seamless enough, however the room we had booked (Deluxe Garden) left a lot to be desired.  Firstly, the room smelled badly of stale cigarettes. Both my wife and myself noticed as soon as we entered the room. When we asked about this we were told that apparently many smoking guests reserve the garden rooms so they can smoke (despite this being a non-smoking hotel) and that the only thing they could do was put a deodorizer in the room.  Secondly, the door to the garden was completely jammed, it took a maintenance guy 30 minutes, a ladder and a lot of pushing and shoving to fix it. The phone in the room was also broken.  Generally, the room itself was very small and narrow, with a tiny bathroom that I could barely fit into. The garden…",2
Old World Charm,belmis,Although the resort may need a refurb it is still beautiful.  The rooms were large and very comfortable.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was excellent.  I have been to Singapore on a number of occasions and wanted to experience something different.,5
Grand old Feeling at this First Rate Hotel,StephaneDubois,Everything about the experience at this hotel is tops. It is grand while remaining intimate and unique. It gives you that feel of time long gone with all the amenities of a modern facility. The only downside is that you cannot really walk anywhere (or walk back because of the hill). My stay in SG going forward.,5
Awesome Singapore,unclebaldy,"Great hotel in the park not good if you don't do steps with it being on a hill. But close to everything public transport walking to sights etc.Room was well maintained nice decor comfortable bed with good quality bedding, nice to have the patio for outside space. My only issue shower glass door didn't seal well enough and left puddle of water on floor, but housekeeping left extra bath mats.",5
hotel in a peaceful setting,simply1,"I chose this hotel as it was away from the noise of the city. Set in a lovely area, the only drawback were the steps in and out if you wanted to go anywhere. The room was large but with the bath in the middle of the room, very odd! The toilet just had misted glass to protect privacy, which was useless. Really liked the happy hour and the pool was lovely and warm. Staff were helpful and friendly.",4
Excellent hotel in fantastic location,OsloTim,"This was the first time I have used this hotel in Singapore.   The location is perfect, in the middle of fort canning park it offers tranquility whilst being in easy walking distance of orchard road and other tourist sites.  Hotel was extremely clean, staff were excellent and the breakfast definitely something to get out of bed for (highly recommend the eggs Benedict)  There are 3 pools available and I made the effort to get up early everyday for a pre breakfast swim.  Highly recommend this to both family and friends. ",5
Peace and style in a lovely setting,Jonathan P,"The staff were very helpful and friendly, particularly when we arrived early in the morning, well before any check in time. The restaurant was also welcoming, with an extensive and delicious breakfast buffet. We enjoyed an evening meal and chose to stay in for supper on a second night. The room was modern and spacious, very striking to look at, though in places the design needed more care - steps to the bathroom area that would have been easy to trip over, for example.  One of our party used the sofa bed in the suite, and this was not comfortable or easy to negotiate. Overall, we found the hotel to be a very peaceful and welcoming base for exploring Singapore.",5
3 day stopover,GCTravellers,"We were referred to the Hotel by our group who travel regularly. It was a 'check it out for future trips' for the group. We wont be back! The bed was 'very comfortable' and the room quiet - water in the shower is spasmodic, still, all very nice, but the staff are surly and a bit up themselves, but suspect this relates to the room you are staying in. To be honest, we were very disappointed, and we are regular travellers and not that fussy. E.G The airport bus dropped us off at the base of the Hotel steps - like 40 steps up with 4 suitcases and this is Singapore sauna level heat and humidity! Sweating like pigs we got to the lobby and told the reception what happened - naively expecting some empathy or God forbid, a room upgrade, it was like, 'speak to the hand'.",3
Nice but isolated hotel,Paul-in-Japan,"Hotel Fort Canning is located in the middle of a park, which gives it a resort feeling but walking to restaurants outside the hotel to ‘nearby’ Circular Quay is a fifteen minute hike and you arrive wishing you had a clean shirt to change into. However the hotel itself is in a very green location with pleasant outdoor areas and a beautiful outdoor pool and very well equipped indoor gym (which also caters to outside members). There are conference facilities on site.   Rooms are nice and spacious and well designed with plenty of lighting. The bath is inset into the open floor so maybe a little exposed for shy people. The air conditioner automatically switches off when you take the key and leave the room so rooms can be hot and damp when you come back. Showers take a while to warm…",3
Fabulous Place to Stay,MrsChippyTheCat,"Hotel Fort Canning is fabulous in so many ways. Not only was the room extremely comfortable and the bathroom facilities superb, the staff were incredibly accommodating and the food to ""write home about"".  The room had separate bathroom and sitting area with an ""egg chair"" that was pure comfort. The bed was very comfortable, the kind of comfortable that you don't even realise it is there, The bathroom had a full size bath and waterfall shower, or hand held if you preferred.  Room service was impeccable and attention is being paid to environmental concerns, particularly the conservation of water.  Whilst you could have a tariff where breakfast is included, we chose to go day by day, primarily because we anticipated going ""out for breakfast"". However, once we were confronted with…",5
Simply perfect,KAPlist,This is a wonderful hotel that just has everything you need in the room. Pool looked wonderful but didn't get a chance to use it. I did the 4 course dinner and it was delicious.  Rooms were nice. I had a bath twice a day because it was just so nice!,5
Space & Serenity on the City's Doorstep,altrac2015,"Situated in the picturesque and peaceful Fort Canning Hill parklands, Fort Canning Hotel is a hidden gem. Whilst the renovated Hotel has all the Five star amenities you need in a hotel, the park surrounds offer the feeling of calm and space not often found so close major city centres. Fort Canning Hill is beautiful & compliments the Hotel so well giving you a real feeling of the tropical location. However its location is also right on the doorstep to some great cafe's, bars and restaurants. Its just a short walk to China town, Orchard road & little India. I would now not stay anywhere else in Singapore.",5
Get-away from City Hustle,shovit b,The hotel ambience was excellent and the rooms have high end technology.  Hotel is secluded from city hustle which is the highlight yet a stone throw away from city mains.  Breakfast had wide range of menus and tasted delicious.  However they could have been more ergonomically designed (like bathtub not needed within the room). That could have made the room more spacious.,5
Quiet hotel From busy area ,Michyzien,"First of all, the service is really good though we stay for a night only but they brought us to our room and clearly explain to us the floor will be slippery since it’s made of marble and tell us to put a towel and etc. The room is really big and romantic because the bathtub is out of the toilet side which is very different from the other hotel I’ve stay. Though the distance from hotel to dhoby Gout mrt is very far but its a very cozy hotel where u would want to stay if you wan to avoid noisy roads.  There is a garden place where couples can have their wedding there and it’s very beautiful when it’s at night. I would highly recommend couple to go a night or two.:)  However, breakfast range can be more I would say. ",5
43rd wedding anniversary,Vince A,Top Hotel with heaps of history in a unique park food was excellent and reasonably priced  we walked to Orchard road  the free wi fi and phone which included free international calls  was a welcome bonus we would definitely stay again plus the staff - we ended up being friends with all,5
having business trip,sarahshaharuzzaman,"overall was satisfied with the hotel. The room are just great with the facilities given & i like the garden view.Most of the staff that i deal with are being helpful & efficient. Just in terms of location wise, it's a bit far from the public transport & need to ""climb up"" a bit to reach to the hotel.The breakfast are just fine.",4
5 STAR HOTEL IN A LOVELY PARK,Tony G-S,"If you want some real Singapore style, the Fort Canning gives a colonial experience. Real character and luxury, although 5-7 mins walk to anywhere. Rooms large & luxurious with high ceilings. Staff wonderful. Restful.",5
Fantastic ,Ian M,Absolutely fantastic staff food facilities were all perfect from start to finish we are all ready planning a return to Singapore and fort canning in the near future the staff especially deserve a special mention they all went out of there way to make us feel very special ,5
If you would like to have a different hotel experience,Anders C,"This is a boutiqish hotel in Fort Canning park. Well worth a stay if you would like to avoid the large hotel chain offerings. It is well situated with short walks to Orchard road, Clark key and the MRT, mind you, it is hot in Singapore and the hotel sits on a hill. Check in was very friendly and you are accompanied to your room. Rooms are a bit different with a bed in the middle of the room and likewise a free standing bath tub. Beds comfortable, wifi speedy but you have to log in each 24 hours. Pool area is very stylish. Every evening from 5 PM there are free snacks and drinks in the hotel lobby. A good way to meet fellow travellers. Breakfast buffe was not as large as in a big hotel but all the necessary items and then some were there and a cook at your service to make you…",5
Room with a nice garden view.,Weiye,The garden room has a nice little garden attached. Bathtub is in the middle of the room so it can be awkward for friends. Hotel is situated on top of a hill so a little climb is to be expected. We came here to celebrate birthday and the reception crew noticed this detail and gave a nice little cake.,4
Relaxing and awesome stay - For honeymoon,Jin_Tung,"When I walked in the hotel, I was impressed by the ambience and warm hospitality from the staff.  Onto the hotel room; the bedroom is really really amazing, equipped with a big bathtub and a separate shower. Free condiments like TWG teabags and a range of Nespresso capsules to make your coffee from. Shower robes and my champagne glasses were provided promptly upon request. My wife and I also enjoyed the free flow wine and champagne in the evening at the hotel lobby.  The downsides are probably, distance from shopping malls, but we enjoyed the walks through the parks/walk ways to and fro the hotel. Well, actually it wasn't too difficult to get a uber/grab/taxi, we just wanted to enjoy the awesome scenery down the park.  Another of which would be the noise from the event party…",5
Tranquil with a few caveats,PatrickP,"Fort Canning Hotel is a relaxing place thats a short stroll from Dohby Gaut MRT and Orchard Road. This conveniently means shopping and dinning isn't too far away. The hotel is located in Fort Canning park, which gives it a green and leafy outlook instead of the usual concrete and steel/traffic and noise/hustle/Bustle of most Singapore Hotels. There are two pools and most of the time they are pretty quiet and relaxing. The rooms are also well appointed, although the loos are not very priavte which is bit of a minor design flaw. The restaurant \/fitness club etc are all well appointed and the breakfast is recommended too... All told Hotel Fort Canning is a wee gem",5
Gorgeous boutique hotel - a one off in busy Singapore,Kerry S,"I stumbled across this hotel while I was running through Fort Canning Park on a recent visit to Singapore for work last year. Our preferred work hotel is on a busy section of Orchard Road, so I was quite keen to stay somewhere a bit more relaxing. My husband joined me on my stay this long weekend and we had a fabulous time. Being very active people who enjoy exercise, we found the hike up the hill a good workout! The gym was outstanding (in-fact the best hotel gym I have been in), and the lap pool provided for more morning exercise. Also the park was lovely for an early morning run. We stayed in a premium room which was very comfortable and quite large with a deep bathtub and quality products. For my next solo visit I think I will choose a deluxe garden room as I like fresh air…",5
Feels like home!,William W,"We love staying here and come back often - in fact we're coming back in July! Old world style and exceptional service, it's the best in Singapore. Breakfast buffet is always a pleasure and the drinks at 6 are not to be missed. The pool is fantastic and we love being surrounded by the Fort Canning Park forest with the sounds of birds and insects buzzing about. It's a peaceful, green oasis in the heart of Singapore. Love it!",5
Relaxing holiday ,KFarre,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for 9 days in Feb and couldn’t be happier. The hotel was lovely, breakfast was good every morning (a little expensive for what you get but was nice) and we used the pool everyday! Loved the bar area too. All of the staff were amazing and we had a really relaxing trip! The location was fantastic and we enjoyed exploring Singapore.",5
Tranquil Hotel in the Busy city,Travel Guy,"Spent 3 nights, everything outstanding. Check in was 1 on 1 with a very nice lady, room is to dye for..HUGE ROOM...wonderful bathtub, very nice pools. Breakfast is outstanding, this is a perfect old style hotel with wonderful service.",5
"Excellent room, loved the nature surroundings",darylhjm87,"Situated on Fort Canning Hill, loved the nature surrounding the hotel and the swings atop the hill. Easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut, Bencoolen and Fort Canning MRT stations, although a bit of climbing is needed. Hotel staff were very friendly, approachable and informative. Receptionist showed us to our rooms personally even though we were located on the 3rd floor. Hotel had 2 swimming pools!! One for families and another being a lap pool.

My only regret was not being able to stay longer.",5
Great 3 night stopover.,Peter,Lovely quiet room with a luxurious bathroom and city view. Pool was beautiful and clean. Great to have the hotel in the Fort Canning Park and so close to walk to the Quay area. Staff were always polite.,4
Everything was smooth and enjoyable,Lizzy L,"A very interesting historic building, rooms are beautifully designed, staff really care about guests. Nearby to museums and culture. There are evening drinks for guests. The pool is beautiful. Breakfast was a bit frantic compared to the relaxing environment in general.",5

A Piece of History,TrevorPAustralian,"Set amongst the park lands yet within easy access to Tourist spots such as Clarke Quay & Orchid Road, this very relaxing & historic hotel offers the traveller respite from the busy & bustling streets of Singapore.

Return visit,RoGo12,"Always lovely to stay here. Our 3rd visit on our way to Aus. Staff lovely, room great. Free wine and canapés! Super breakfast. What more could we ask for?  It’s also away from the madding crowd a small oasis away from all the noise of the city yet so convenient too, with buses and metro nearby.  Can’t recommend it enough!  ",5
St. Valentines Package,Artyom_KZ,"Would not recommend to buy St. Valentines package. Was a bit disappointed when I entered the room with deco and what was provided.  Also, got some problems with vanity and bad smell in bathroom.  In general Hotel is good looking in good and calm location (Fort Canning Park). Has few pools and spa (unfortunately haven't tried, because it was fully booked).",3
Small touches...,55Steelman55,"The free to use mobile phone was a nice touch even though I got my timings mixed up and phoned a mate in Scotland at 0500 his time......he appreciated the gesture. For those with a late flight home you can leave your luggage, go out for the day then make use of the leisure club to shower and change. In terms of location, The Battlebox ( World War 2  HQ ) is a minute walk and getting to Clarke Quay is an easy walk over the top of the hill, we discovered this on our last day after going down the hill and round the bottom. There are complimentary drinks every evening which is a nice touch once you discover the price of drinks.....plus a happy hour in their own bar till 8pm. As I know the management read these reviews I'd make one observation, we came in from Changi by MRT and…",5
PERFECT PLACET,Dayenerys,"The Hotel is surrounded by Fort Canning Park; it is a very nice place for a walk and full of historical sightseeing.  You can find the Ruffles House, it was built in 1819 and the burial place of last muslin king of Singapore Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah, who ruled in 14th century. And you can have rest of fort walls, fort gate and some cannons and many more!  Don’t forget to visit Battle Box – the underground bunker of the Second World War where Sir Arthur Percival made his crucial decision to surrender Singapore in 1942 to Japanese.               The Hotel was built in 1926 like barracks for British officers, who defended Singapore in times of World War II.   I admire the results of the work of architects and designers who have reconstructed the barracks into the Hotel! Rooms are…",5
Beautiful Old Hotel in Historical Park,Jim M,"Room was gorgeous, well-appointed with great view.  It is extremely peaceful and quiet around the hotel.  In the room, everything was electronic including drapes.  A mobile phone comes with the room, a unique and useful feature for doing your own travel planning and ticketing right from your room.  GPS feature on mobiles is always useful.  The convenience and no cost operation of the phone made it a welcome addition in a foreign land.  Phone calls are all complimentary including international to certain countries.  Comfortable chairs in a sitting room were welcome.  A powder room is off the sitting room so there are two bathrooms.  The facility and grounds were gorgeous.  A relaxing walk is possible near the hotel.  It takes a taxi to get to any restaurant or other venue.  The…",5
Great second visit!,Richard G,"This was our second trip to Singapore, and our second stay here. While it’s expensive (for us), it’s great value - quiet location in Fort Canning Park but easy to get everywhere; great pool where you can chill, and excellent rooms. Staff are friendly and efficient. And dining in is reasonable. About the only hotel I would give 10 out of 10 to.",5
Lovely hotel,EssexHamish,"Located in rainforest park in the centre of the city! It is on the top of a hill (I guess the clue is in the name!) And has a bygone feel.  You do have to walk down to MRT or hop on hop off bus. We could have done with a shuttle at times!!  For night life, you need a taxi. For us, we would have preferred Orchard Road location but that's just our choice.  Staff are attentive and helpful  - rooms has an interesting twist - bathrooms are situated on the balcony area. Do say if it's not what you  want!",4

Great Getaway,Steve S,Excellent overall hotel experience. Conversion of historic building is of highest quality with high level of contemporary design finish. Placed in park-like setting away from the Singapore hustle and bustle. Rooms are good sized with excellent beds and linens. Included breakfast was best of eastern and western items. Staff was very helpful. Would definitely stay there on our next visit.,5
Disappointing from start to finish,lisafM8308VL,"We were booked in here for a week. From the start - it all went wrong! Our luggage was left outside the hotel whilst we checked in.  No welcome or niceties - receptionist's manner was cold and she also dealt with others at the same time which we considered extremely rude. Along with the receptionist, we had to take our own luggage to our room - thought this was a 5 star hotel! On the face of it our room looked ok - ultra modern with noisy blinds and we think they were trying to be too clever in the design.  It was fairly late in the evening and we had a good meal in the restaurant. Returned to the room to unpack. Bath - filthy at the back and the hand-shower holder was not screwed in. Bathroom blind splattered with toothpaste and soap. Shower - mould around two edges. Toilet…",1
Outstanding until we checked out,Norman K,"The hotel is in an outstanding beautiful location. Our room was modern and spacious and very clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and probably the best we have ever enjoyed. There was a large selection and all the food was fresh  and good quality.   Unfortunately I left my passport wallet with $500 inside on the top of the bed while packing to begin a 15 day cruise. I had a premonition that I had forgotten the wallet after boarding the ship and prior to the delivery of my luggage to our cabin. Sure enough the wallet and money were not in my luggage. I know that the wallet and money were left in our Fort Canning Hotel room, as we took a taxi directly from the hotel to the cruise ship port and my luggage was completely zipped up when I received it on the…",3
Short comfortable Christmas weekend stay!,Xyrich,"This is a lovely colonial style hotel in a middle of a park.   Although the hotel was running full the day we stayed, we still felt the hotel as generally very peaceful and quiet.   The pools were almost empty when we went for swims and the enormous gym had advance equipment that really impressed us.  We booked a Premium Room and we totally love the layout and the fusion of colonial and modern interior. Space was alright for two occupants especially the oversize bathroom.  We booked the Christmas Themed dinner at the Salon and we came back to our room full and happy!",5
A Fine Fort,Nate L,I flew to Singapore on business and opted to stay at the Fort Canning.  The rooms were spacious and comfortable. Desk area perfect for working late into night. The bathrooms were very large although the water temperature in the shower was suspect (probably an isolated situation).  The pool was a little walk from my room and wasn't all that impressive but the gym was great!!  The breakfast catered for many tastes and was huge. I don't think i had lunch most days.  The hotel is well located but the hill makes it not the ideal place for those who will not be in a cab.  I would recommend this hotel but would probably chose a hotel not on top of a hill the next time.   ,4

Fort Canning Hotel and Canning Park were great,521Barbara,"The service was good with all people very friendly and helpful. The room was great, large enough but the bathroom on the outside took a bit of getting used to, and the lack of a balcony in such a serene area is a mistake. The location is great and Canning Park is wonderful, we had a walk in the park.",4
Clean; modern; quiet; helpful staff,Denver257,"Stayed for 3 nights. The location is a little quirky since its in the middle of a huge park, but its still within city center.   The rooms are big and clean. The pillows and bed were wonderful. I especially liked the reading chair, it was a great touch.   Overall highly satisfied. ",5
"Nice and pleasant overall, still a special day for us",Mc G,"Hotel and rooms are unique, different from other hotels that I have stayed. The swimming pool is nice but there's no drink bar or service for drinks, there was a phone nearby but not sure if it was meant for that but we later saw the notice that no food and drinks are allowed. The Salon is great with good food and service, staff are prompt and attentive, really satisfied dining at the restaurant.  We find the shower awkward, shower head will not face down and will spray at the wall, shower wall has a gap and the shower door can't be closed properly and bathroom will be wet after each shower, requested for 2 more floor mats but not enough to dry the floor. Got a complimentary slice of cake for birthday celebration, that's all.",4

Stay to enjoy the nature,ptanth,"The location of the hotel is very good, close to nature, which is the reason we chose this hotel for our wedding anniversary stay. The room is nice. However the amenities are very basic, there is no steam or suana room in the gym or swimming pool and the gym is at a separate building that has no link to the main hotel rooms building. The service is only average, lower than what we had expected from a 4 or 5 class hotel. There is only two guest officers at the front office and sometimes, only one when I need some assistance. I would say the room rate is more for the nature and the room itself. For that price, one would expect to have better amenities and service.",3
Singapore city oasis,shelljj62,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Fort Canning.   We only ate breakfast at the hotel & was very happy with what was on offer.   The hotel itself has a special historical significance which appealed to us.  Being right in the middle of the park, we were able to explore the park but also go different directions to take us to different city areas.  Room was cleaned & maintained.  Biggest gripe is lack of fresh milk in hotel fridge (but this is everywhere but it shouldn’t be!!).  We did have a couple of taxi drivers that weren’t sure if entry & exit points which is no fault of hotel though. Enjoyed our stay!",5
Tucked away in a Beautiful Park yet close to all the Main Attractions,Jacqueline R,We spent 4 nights at the hotel in January 2018. It was delightful. The room was spacious and well appointed. There were plenty of power points which is so unusual in hotels! There was even a mobile phone for guests to use during their stay. Calls could be made to 10 or so countries including Australia - free of charge as well. The bathroom was the feature of the space. I was able to lie in the bath and enjoy a lovely garden view. Bliss! A beautiful experience which we highly recommend for a serene environment in  gorgeous Fort Canning Park.,5
Wonderful Stay Both Times,John K,"y wife and I accompanied our son on a 3 week tour of Singapore, Vietnam, Bankok, and Bali. We all stayed at Hotel Ft Canning first 2 nights and last 2 nights. Hotel was a wonderful experience, both as an introduction to Asia and as our final place of comfort to collect our thoughts. Bring your swimsuit to enjoy their Olympic pool. Great breakfast with room. Perfect location for peace and quiet, yet easily walkable to the other sights and shopping in this pearl of a big city.",5
Two nights ,Nasser A,"The hotel location was amazing literally in the garden ,The hotel is a old French design with modern rooms.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The downside of this hotel is the price of accommodation and room service (they charge for each peace of bread 5 SD as shown in picture).  Room service menu was limited but they did serve me with food out of the list.thanks for that  Overall I recommend this hotel because of the friendly staff and unique location.",4

Oasis in the hustle & bustle,orchTraralgon,"We stayed at HFC over Dec / Jan 2017/18. Chosen specifically for the hotel location, amidst Fort Canning Park. This is a relatively new hotel, check-in very easy, room very nice, well maintained & presented. Bar area good, did find drink prices to be on the high side, waited for happy hour :) Restaurant also good. The ""sets""  were excellent value, very tasty, well presented. Breakfast can be a shambles when all guests want to order their eggs at once, but by and large things worked smoothly. Service in all areas excellent. Peculiarity - no power point in bathroom ?

Not a 5 Star Hotel & Credit Card abuse,Baris Y,Frozen goods served at breakfast. Unfriendly staff. They kept holding extra amounts from my credit card even after 1 month of the checkout. I have never seen such thing before. The only good thing with this hotel is the location.,1
"Great hotel, Great location",James E,"We arrived for a 3 night stay at the start of our honeymoon, the greeting was great and the room was lovely, if not a little quirky with the layout. The room was effectively back to front but no bother it was clean and comfortable!  The hotel is well located, a short stroll to 2 MTR stations on different lines, and some taxis did have a problem finding it but once you know the way through the park it’s quite simple to direct them the last 200m or so! The only negatives were that each room didn’t have an umbrella, and as it was very wet for the duration of our stay this was frustrating as at the front desk we were told all available umbrellas had already been borrowed and had to buy our own. Other 5 star hotels I have stayed in provide one in room. Also when we checked out we…",4
Not a 5 Star hotel,Sarah G,"Extremely disappointed. We had to move rooms 3 times due to the first room being in full view of the pool where we would have had to had the curtains closed the whole time for privacy and then the next room was dirty. There was coffee marks on the walls and table, there was white stains on the bed sheets. It looked like it hasn’t been dusted in months. After a long journey to Singapore we waited 40 mins for them to then move us to another room which I had to chase and they had to get the Supervisor to check the cleanliness which makes me question the state of all rooms. It still wasn’t great to be honest but we was so tired by then. Very dated and not 5 Star. The hotel is far away from the town centre you have to get a taxi. I wouldn’t stay here again.",3
An oasis in the heart of Singapore,Shirlie Kwok,"Beautiful and elegant hotel. The whole place is surrounded by lots of greens, the location is quiet and calm, one can hardly hear any noises of traffic.

It is the 4th time I stayed at this hotel and I will definitely keep coming back.",5

An acquired taste,Syd_traveller_1,"This hotel is professionally run and clean, but will appeal to some more than others. The rooms have a curious layout with the view in many dedicated entirely to the bathroom (i.e. you walk in and are in the bedroom and living area, then the next space - taking up the full window frontage - is the bathroom), and it is not clear from the inside whether there is reflective glass on the outside. So if you're on business and working, you have to look at the view through a bathroom the whole time. Maybe it would work better on a personal holiday but I'm unsure about that either.  Everything in the room - lights etc. - is operated by a touchpad device and it's all just a bit overwhelming. Against that though, the staff are very helpful and pleasant. The food is good.",3
"Beautiful colonial hotel - lovely rooms, swimming pools & peaceful central location",Fran B,"This is a beautiful hotel with an interesting colonial history, set amidst the peaceful gardens of Fort Canning Park in central Singapore.  Beautiful large rooms & bathrooms with a wow factor, and the beds are very comfortable. Gorgeous outdoor pools, delicious breakfasts, helpful & courteous staff, and free drinks and nibbles between 6-7pm a nice touch. We recommend the BattleBox tour of the WW2 allied command bunker, just a few minutes from the front of the hotel. Fort Canning park itself is lovely, with lots of trees & walking paths.  Centrally located but it felt like another world away from the bustle of the city.  A short walk down to Clarke Quay and an easy taxi ride to almost anywhere.  We enjoyed staying here and would love to return.",5
The squirrels were nice ,pixiepants21,"My partner and I stayed at Fort Canning for 4 nights after three weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia. We booked this hotel because we had seen it in a previous trip to Singapore and thought it looked peaceful and unique for Singapore, and it was. The staff were accommodating and polite, but we did encounter issues with the lighting in the rooms- something kept blowing in the switchboard and our lights would either not turn on, or if we were really lucky, not turn off when we wanted to go to bed. Small things like the coffee not being topped up by housekeeping, no cushions on the loungers by the pool (why???) meant that for $400 a night I was a little disappointed. The rooms are lovely and well appointed, and the garden areas are a great touch (squirrels were delightful) but a little…",3
Decent hotel,NBOUNDARY,"Been there for two nights which just a so so experience. Walking distance from fort canning station and as well to other attractions. Room is quite small,m and noisy from the air-con I guess. Hygiene is ‘not their priority’ I think.  Just a so so hotel for me.",3
Lovely venue and ambience for a garden themed wedding but that's about it,Sharon A,"We took a Studio Suite for a family of 4 as we were attending a wedding at HFC.  It's a beautifully refurbished colonial building and is a lovely blend of old world charm with modern amenities. But please do bear in mind that it is still a very old building. The plumbing is weak (the toilet had to be flushed a couple of times after each use), there aren't enough electrical outlets and some didn't work. Do be careful with the freestanding bathtub. It's placed on a slightly raised platform which has sharp corners. The problem is that it blends with the marble flooring so it's quite easy to trip over it. There is a switch which lights up the platform at night (functions as night light too) BUT the blue light is simply too distracting and interfered with our sleep. In the end, we…",3
Some positives and a big negative,Melsa85,"We are staying here for 9 days at the moment. It’s our honeymoon. I really wanted to be able to give this a 5/5. The location is good - quiet and feels out of the city but a 3 min walk to an MRT station and we are really enjoying the pools. There seems to be very few children about which makes the pool and the overall feel of the place very quiet and relaxing. Canapés and free drinks from 6-7pm has also been a big plus. Very few taxis or Uber’s know how to find the place so be prepared to give directions. The room also needs a mention - while it is lovely and the bathtub is glorious, the privacy frosting over the toilet makes things very awkward. We are a couple but if we were not so comfortable with each other I can imagine it would be quite distressing. You can see pretty much…",2
Lovely historic hotel,111shiwa,"Great service, lovely rooms. We loved the free drinks and nibbles at 6pm. Loved being in a park with lots of trees and walks. Tip - it rains every day about 2pm! There is a free tour of the park you can do if you book with reception. It is very historical. Unfortunately it rained. Yes our tour was 2pm.",5
Excellent location,Vivien P,"We chose HFC for its location and its historical significance.  However, we were disappointed that the hotel's offerings did not live up to our expectations.  This is not a cheap hotel. However, there is only one dining option which is limiting.  The air conditioning in our room was so noisy we resorted to turning it off at night.  In addition, our room was not sound proof due to an adjoining door with the next door room. As a result we could hear our neighbour's conversations loud and clear.  The hotel does deserve some bouquets, however.  Service was excellent and we were very grateful for the luggage storage and shower facilities afforded us in lieu of a late check out. We did, also, appreciate the nightly happy hour of free wine for hotel guests.",3
Love hotel - signage could be improved as hard for taxis/ubers to find,Amy B,"Stayed 2 nights. Beautiful room and excellent amenities.  Excellent staff, very attentive.  We did the breakfast buffet one day, and then a la carte the following, and food was great. The park is gorgeous, very nice respite from the city. Location is up on a hill in the park, and the signs up the hill to the hotel are not clear and so we had some trouble finding the hotel entrance and getting ubers to pick us up (they would cancel after looping around the grounds). This can be easily fixed I image by the hotel.",5
Fantastic Stay,lola,We had a problem with our booking due to our son not being able to join us. The front desk staff were amazing and so accommodating.

An Oasis in Singapore ,Wanderer747363,We had almost a week staying at the Hotel Fort Canning and it was a pleasure to return to the hotel after exploring the city of Singapore. Located near the centre of the city and nestled in a beautiful historic park the hotel offers a cool and tranquil respite from the city. The hotel was very personable and the staff very friendly and helpful. They knew it was my birthday and they made me cake and even decorated our room. The bar and restaurant prices were very reasonable.,5
Classy refuge atop a hill,A Nair,"We loved everything about the Premium Deluxe room. The warm, elegant ambience, sheer space, giant green armchair in the air-conditioned yet outdoorsy-feeling sit-out, discreet hi-tech touches everywhere (those blinds!), and classy Nespresso cuppas anytime we wanted it. The marble-clad bath deserves its own review with a deep, monolithic tub perfect for some couple bath therapy. From check-in to reception, smart elegance pervades everything. Refreshing chlorine-free laps in a fairly quiet pool makes any staycation worth spending in its entirety within hotel premises. When you do step out, amble along Fort Canning park gawking at arboreal heritage and sweeping city vistas. Or descend for a quick dip into the city bustle before you quickly make your way back to spend every minute…",5
Excellent!,kbjung,"My first visit to Singapore was made even more pleasant by the quiet relaxing atmosphere of the Hotel Fort Canning. Situated in a restored historic British colonial building in Fort Canning Park, the hotel is a pleasant respite from the bustling city nearby but very accessible to the city’s fantastic public transportation system. I especially liked the contrast of the sleekly designed hotel rooms within the structure of the historic building and highly recommend the rooms with the large bright and spacious bathrooms on the exterior. An added bonus were the two swimming pools - one 25 meters for lap swimming. The hotel and restaurant staff were all very friendly and accommodating.

The Wedding Stay,Ezcapaid,"Booked for a two nights at the Deluxe Room for my wedding stay in July 2017. The room size was spacious enough for that length stay, the bathroom is a separated area from the room and it's space was large and bright. Kinda kinky to have an large window at the bathroom area overlooking at the forest. We had also the so-call balcony to chill out and leaving only the bedroom side was sleeping. Amenities, features and appliance are also awesome. Their remotes for the room features are advance technology. The setting of the room felt cozy too, we did not have that heavy feeling. We did not use the round cushion on the bed though, it's cover and color looks like a trash bag from afar.  The breakfast buffet variety was mostly Asian. Not bad.  The hotel ambiance is the best especially…",5
Friendly staff,Phyllis H,"Location was great with lots of greenery around, eateries and malls nearby too. Stayed here during christmas eve and they were clearly short handed as we waited almost 2hrs to check in, even when we reached there after the check in time.  We headed to the lounge to get drinks and light snacks, only to find out that other guests waiting for their rooms were served complimentary drinks at the lobby area. Would probably appreciate if the staff could inform us about it so we don't have to waste money when it's not our fault that rooms were not ready.  Saving grace was that the staff offered us complimentary breakfast and late check out at 2pm. The room was worth the wait! Would definitely be back again.",4
A delightful individual hotel in Singapore ,Chrisrickenbacker,"We stayed seven nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and would thoroughly recommend it. The staff are polite, helpful and friendly and we appreciated their efforts to make us feel a valued guest. The hotel itself is a restored historic building, and is quite quirky in some respects. I found this added to the charm of the building, particularly the carefully retained wooden doors and windows on the ground floor. There are steep steps up from Dhoby Ghaut MRT, if you are arriving with bags, consider a taxi for this bit! The “Handy” mobile phone that comes free with the room is brilliant, we never left the hotel without it. The breakfasts and evening meal we had were both very good.

It was amazing, exactly as advertised and I got just the room I was looking to book with help from the reservation manager Ms Maggie Chow. The room was big with touch screen control panels to control lights and window blinds. The bathroom was divine. Everything was working and the room was clean. We ordered room service twice for dinner and breakfast and the food was great and delivered in an impeccable manner. A special mention of appreciation to the Indian lady(I forgot to take down her name in my haste) at the check in counter who helped to facilitate my check in - she saved me from a lot of trouble by helping me borrow 2 specific drinking glasses from the bar which i should have packed, but forgot. Will definitely come back here…",5
Great place to stay,Lulu N,"A beautiful and impressive hotel situated in extensive ground; helpful and pleasant staff and very unique rooms, which may not be to everyone's liking.  Service was excellent, facilities good and the food served was always to a high standard. I would definitely return for pleasure next time to this beautiful hilltop oasis!",5
"A sad experience - poor layout, poor rooms",James,"The standard rooms are truly annoying because between the bedroom and the window is the bathroom. The bathroom has an automatic door which opens and closes of its own accord sometimes. The windows loo out onto the park and mean that you are really overlooked by anyone walking through the park as the hotel is on a lower level, so the third floor rooms are at eye level with walkers. Having the bathroom between the window and the bedroom means that if you want privacy when you wash or go to the toilet, you need to have the blinds down. As a result it becomes, in essence, it is a ""5 star room"" without a window. The design of the more expensive rooms looks like it doesn't have this problem, so if you stay here, go for one of those I guess. I really wish I had.  The second thing to…",2

Excellent service & beautiful room,icypen,"I’ve booked a deluxe room via agoda at a good rate of $595 for 2 nights.  HFC has impressed me even before I stepped into their grounds.  1) They bothered to send a confirmation email, which I’ve never encountered b4 even staying at a 5star hotel  2) Reservation officer even took the initiative to suggest decorating the room after knowing my purpose of this staycation.   Check in was smooth & staff was friendly, making us feel welcomed.  Room was just as described in their website. Beautiful. Bathroom is huge. It’s a pity that the window isn’t 1 way tinted, otherwise we can enjoy  the view while having privacy.   There is no shuttle service provided.

For this price SEARCH ELSEWHERE !!,najlaber08511,"I've been in 2 minds about this review but as a seasoned traveler I'm going to be brutually honest... I feel people should always know the truth when looking for a 5* hotel at FC prices   1. They charge  $25 per head for breakfast and it was the most bland breakfast we have ever had. The check in man made us pay upfront before we had a chance to have a try and specifically said no refunds so we had to suck it up and eat there, we basically went straight to another spot less than 2 hours later as we hadn't had much to fill our appetite. I feel like charging each day for breakfast up front is a trick to seal you in, don't do it! Trial it first (you will see what I mean yourself first hand). Why was I not asked if I wanted to pay as I go? Selection should be reviewed and…",2
Excellent Stay,Rainydaywomen,"Lovely location and very good quality. Room was very spacious and well-equipped. Lighting remote control in the room was really useful. Nice touch with the free-to-use mobile phone so roaming charges weren’t incurred on your own mobile. We had breakfast, dinner and snacks and they were all excellent. Staff were very friendly. Really enjoyable stay. ",5
Tranquil place to escape the hustle ,Renae Leith-Manos,"When I arrived at this hotel tucked at the end of Orchard Road, it did feel a touch old fashioned & old world.   But once I settled it, it really grew on me. Rooms are large with stunning white bathrooms with huge windows - brilliant for applying make-up.  There was a massive shower with two shower heads. Gorgeous. The lobby & bar area is also spacious, but a lovely place to enjoy a pre or post dinner drink. The breakfast room is ready for a refurbishment, and the buffet was ok, nothing amazing. The pool area is gorgeous - kids would love it. Huge swimming pools & plenty of places to sit. The gym is excellent - a highlight of the hotel. It is huge with modern equipment & plenty of choice.  The hotel regularly hosts weddings & events, but it is so big, it doesn’t have much of an…",5

Luxury and colonial/modern elegance,JASMINE W,I came here alone. I was supposed to go to Thailand to kick off the start of my around the world tour but chickened out and went to Singapore for the 2nd time to see all the things i missed. This is a beautiful hotel. Mineral pools. Great tub and shower. Beautiful decor. Room service was awesome. High tea and prosecco was great as well.,5

"If you are looking for a venue for the most important day of your life, look no further!",ericteng,"Just had our banquet lunch on 11/11/2017! Our wedding coordinator Ivy is always so responsive and attentive to our requests prior to our actual day. Our banquet manager Alvin is always ready to take care of every single details and situations that occur during our banquet. He updates us 1st hand and advice us on what to do next, which gave us lots of assurance and time to mingle with our guests. Food and service was great throughout the lunch and we were extremely happy about the great feedbacks from our guests. Overall, we would like to thank the whole wedding team for being so accomodating and professional in making our lunch a truly memorable event!  Love you guys!",5
Super location nice feel to the place,Bingleytraveller,"Had a nice up market feel with modern rooms and free smart phone to use which was a pleasant surprise, super looking pool which we didn't have time to use.Orchard road near by just remember to use the lift down to the car park or you have a hill to walk down and up. Staff can't be more helpful.",5
We were a little disappointed on our most recent stay,Delia R,"We've stayed at this hotel now a number of times as it's always been a great spot for stopovers to/from Australia but when we stayed earlier this month, I have to say, we were disappointed.  The service has become somewhat off hand and the restaurant in the hotel, where we ate dinner (which has been refurbished since our last visit) was totally lacking in character with incredibly bright lighting & bland food.   It used to be such a charming spot but I think now we'll probably look at other hotels for our next stay in Singapore.",3
Lovely hotel,Michelle B,"This hotel is fabulous. We were upgraded to a larger room on arrival. Heritage listed, converted from Defence HQ into a luxury hotel. The only downfall is its location to Singapore city central, although taxis are affordable to get around easily. Overall, a very enjoyable experience!",5
Beautiful quiet location,DavidInns,"Great location away from hustle and bustle of traffic. Setting in Park is quite special especially for morning or evening walks. Easy walking distance to River, close to metro. Great pools and very good breakfast. Excellent chill out hotel yet well equipped for business traveller too.",5
6 days' stay,Afnan,"Can't say that i am going to choose it again. It only has the advantage of the surrounding view and parks beside this i had a problem with Ants and other problems in bathroom tabs. Also it's so close to the partying place so you can still hear the DJ & music while staying in your room, maybe because my trip was for work so i didn't enjoy this part :)    with that being said, i may still recommend it for people who are looking for great nature views and parks and it also located in a short walking distances to many other good places in Singapore.",2
Peaceful and Relaxing,LesD123,"Great hotel with character.  We stayed for 9 nights October/November.  The room was spacious, quiet and overlooked the park.  The staff were extremely polite, helpful and friendly.  Quiet during the week, busy on Saturday with 3 weddings but that didn't interfere with the hotel service, just lovely to see.  10 minutes walk to Clarke Quay, Orchard Road and the MRT in 2 directions.  In the business of Singapore it was a peaceful haven.  Hopefully we will return!",5
A Gem Surrounded by a Park but in the Mddle of the City,Raynor C,"Loved this hotel! Stayed here for 7days in October with a friend. This is a small boutique hotel & was the British Far East Command Headquarters during the Second World War. It is surrounded by 18 hectares of lush greenery (Fort Canning Park). We stayed in a ground floor room which was comfortable with a small courtyard. This room is an open planned room meaning that there was no bathroom which was a little confronting especially when travelling with a friend, but apart from that aspect we loved everything else about this hotel. You were give a smart phone for your personal use during your stay which came in very handy when trying to navigate your way around Singapore. Being situated within the Fort Canning Park, you felt like you were not in a city even when relaxing by the…",5
Great location. Nice hotel with character.,dlbennett3454,Always use this hotel when in Singapore. Great location and good staff with easy access to Orchard  and MTR.  Enjoy the free drinks invitation in the evening .Nice chance to meet other guests. Breakfast is very average.Its moved from the glass house to a much smaller area in the main hotel. Choice of cereals is limited. Fruit juices are cheap and watery.One toaster to make toast so you queue. You burn more calories getting up and down to get breakfast than you consume. No containers to put milk in for tea. No tea pots to make tea .No containers to put preserves in.Lunch and dinner in the same area are fine. Rooms are nice. Shower needs to be maintained more often. Dont like to see mould.Lovely pool area which is easily accesible from your room.Pool furniture is starting to look…,4
Away from Hustle and Bustle,brnrd_h,"Lots of greenery as hotel is on the hill, has a good park for running and lots of military history. Though on the fringe of the city, it's quiet, serene and a good place to relax, refresh and rejuvenate. The colonial building has high ceilings, grand looking and a nice view in room while taking shower. It has a comprehensive and big gym and 2 swimming pools which I like most. More so the great service by counter staff Abagil and Ruby, The Salon Cafe Grace Fu and Nelita, Housekeeping staff Han Yan and Zhi Jun and gym staff Suliman. Not forgetting Reservations Manager Maggie, They were friendly and served with passon and smiles. Probably the only comment would be between 6 - 8 pm Happy Hours when foods are little and not replenished fast. Also hot beverages to be served. Anyway,…",4
best place in singapore,PeterjuneJaipur,"we had our 40th wedding aniversary there and we cannot praise this hotel enought.  everything was wonderful; room, pool ,staff, resturant and gardens.  Not cheap but worth it for special occasions and or stop over in singapore",5

All you could ask for,witszaters,"May not be in the City Centre, but that has it's advantages. Surrounded by park with plenty of space to wander without being in the city. The room contained a fabulous skyline view from the bathroom, a Nespresso Machine and an IPod to take with us when we explored Singapore, we could use it to ring for Taxis, directions etc. Lots of Military History, including an Underground Bunker, ""Battle Box"" etc all within walking distance. Even after we had checked out, we were urged to partake of ""Happy Hour"", between 6-7pm with Hors D'Ouvres, and we were shown to an area where we could shower and change for our overnight flight.",5
Disappointing welcome!,hazelmcnb,"Stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world, but upon late arrival at night we had a very cold, unpleasant welcome from the concierge. We had such an amazing trip in Bali before Singapore so we were very disappointed with the lack of warm greeting from him. The concierge brought us in the elevator and pointed to the direction of the room and stepped back in the elevator... this is not 5 star luxury. The next morning I spoke to another concierge who was very pleasant and assisted me in a late check out free of charge.  From then on the rest of the staff were all smiles... word gets around.... I would have given a 2 star rating but the hotel grounds and rooms are quite beautiful. I especially love the bathrooms which have high ceilings and quite grand looking! It also has a nice…",3
"Excellent hotel, room smaller than expected",Gloria P,Colonial building is really fascinating and room is furnished and accessorized in a elegant and functional way (I especially appreciated the Nespresso machine inside). Personnel was always kind and helpful. Size of the room was a little smaller than expected tho. Great choice if you want to go for a run as the hotel is in hill with a great trail to jog!,4
chance to decompress,missycitygirl,"Fabulous Oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  Loved our quiet stay here, beautiful pool and lovely building.  The bar was a great place to have a quiet drink at the end of a hard shopping day! The only thing to be aware of, is you need to be fit to walk to and from the MRT, otherwise taxis are easy to come by.",5
Outstanding Service and Stunning Rooms,Mace H,"I greatly enjoyed a 3 night stay at Hotel Fort Canning. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and my room was wonderful.  As you enter the room you have a long desk/workspace which is the backboard of the king size bed. Beyond the bed was the bathroom, a glorious bath on one side, a shower on the other with different shower heads and a central basin, all of which looked out onto the surrounding area.  Another feature is that each room comes with a free mobile phone that you can use doing your Singapore vacation. The room service food was very good.  Simple stunning!  The hotel has a range of conference and function spaces and is centrally located. Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay are within walking distance as is the famous Raffles.  I HIGHLY recommend a stay at…",5
Beautiful Hotel Fort Canning,SimonHorn_43,"Visited for a business trip, truly a beautiful hotel. All facilities are available, staff extremely helpful in all areas.

Average,CNK36,"Positives:  friendly staff  beautiful green, but central location very nice bathroom  Beautiful light meeting rooms   Not so great's:  Limited and uninspiring room service menu  limited restaurant options on site  spa quite expensive and not anything special  Rooms are small and absolutely not sound proof  Bathrooms are quirky - fitted to the front of the room with a big window, very overlooked unless you close the blinds   Breakfast options limited",3
Amazing unique place to stay,Gemma F,My partner and I had a wonderful stay in October. The staff were super helpful and nothing was too much trouble! We loved the historic look to the building with all new amenities. The Handy phone in the room was great so didn't cost us a fortune trying to navigate around the city. Also the 6pm complimentary drinks was a great way to relax in the evening before dinner and get to know other guests in the hotel.,5
hip but neither comfortable nor cosy,SSchaerrer,"the best part is the reception/concierge desk. they are outstanding! the rest is mediocre, rooms have a huge bath just besides the bed (who wants that.....) but no space to put any suitcase..... one small sink for two people in a suite... toilet cubicle too small (you can't sit and have the door shut...) the restaurant is looking bland and reminds of a students mensa... self service....

An enchanted wedding,Imakelv,"My wife and me held our wedding at the Marquee and it was amazing. All the guests were amazed by how grand and beautiful it looked especially the lightings which were perfect. The team had set up our solemnization at the lawn outside the Marquee and the settings were so pretty! However, we were hit by a sudden downpour although the team were very efficient and they immediately relocated us to the 3rdlevel of the glasshouse. Fantastic work by the team (AV team was great too!).  I would like to express my sincerest thanks to Cheryl Lim who helped to co-ordinate the event and the tasks leading up to our wedding.

Magic,Kaine T,"This was my first trip to Singapore and it has to be said, right at the start, Singapore is magic and the people are amazing.   After a, surprisingly cheap, taxi ride to Hotel Fort Canning (HFC), first impressions are:  - it’s a small oasis in the middle of a huge and bustling city.   - it’s a colonial relic that’s been given new life as a beautiful hotel.   - it’s just right when you want the pace of a big city but a few days to wind down first.   The room I had was called premium-luxe, it’s the first suite type room. It’s large, well appointed and - like the rest of HFC - just a touch quirky.   The bed is super comfortable, the room light and breezy (sweet relief) and the outlook was nice too. Tip: whatever grade room you get, I doubt you’d be disappointed to be honest.   The…",5
"Not for us, but good hotel",dikel,"Yes the hotel is a quiet & green hotel with it's surrounding gardens, but if you don't like stairs & steps it's not for you - we enjoy walking but the journey back to hotel is all up hill (you can go through the underground carpark to dodge stairs at the end).  If you are a smoker, stay away - the area for smoking is inadequate (considering the space outdoors, they allow people to smoke just outside the dining/lounge bar) but when it rains, which is most afternoons/evenings, there's nowhere to shelter or sit. Room (we had premium) was adequate, but no windows/balcony & looked out onto the driveway - ask for the lookout over city & garden on the other side. Pools are fantastic & everything is clean. Possibly a few more chairs around the pool - can be limiting. Staff are lovely,…",4
Serendipity - a home away from home,K F T,"Firstly, kudos to the warm, attentive and professional staff at all levels!  Hotel with character given its history and architecture, loved the pools especially night swims under full moon, garden surroundings, views and rooms with their high ceilings, beautiful bathrooms and comfortable beds/linens.  Liked the park facing sunny sitting area and open bathroom design in the upper floor premium room with high ceilings, mirrored marble walls, tub and rain shower facing the park, preferred the wooden floors in the upper rooms over marble in the ground floor garden unit. A/C positioning was also better in the upper rooms.  Overall, very pleased with our stay and will return.",5
Anniversary Weekend,MsMonteith,"The Deluxe Room is the most basic room available at Hotel Fort Canning, and even then it made for a wonderful, luxurious anniversary weekend away. From the moment we arrived (jetlagged and exhausted) the staff were wonderfully accommodating, allowing us to wait in the lounge, have a shower, even use the pool before check-in while we waited for our room to be ready. They even managed to have it all prepared before the usual check-in time. The quality of the room was superb, the beds are comfortable, the bathroom view over towards Orchard Road was lovely, framed with treetops and palms.

Wonderful relaxing stay,alafhoop,Wonderful hotel that is in a perfect location. So quiet yet so close to everything.

Really truly one of the better.,Jay-P L,"5 star service with very few and very minor neg. points, in the middle of Fort Canning Park & just in front of the entrance of the 'Battle Box' - HQ British Malaya Forces till their surrender in WW2. (Google Battle Box.) Personal service in a relatively smaller but very high-end hotel environment made it top to our taste.  Low on kids & no pets. Offered snacks & drinks during happy hour (for guests only). Nice rooms with big bathroom and extra salon space or smaller with private terrace garden, depending on your room type choice. 2 swimming pools. We sure appreciate much more this hotel above the high-end big chains. Very nice stay that we prolonged a week extra! (checked out 2 room types)",4

This is a review for room 201 only,clabel1977,"Room 201 on the second floor. This room shouldn't even be a room. We were too tired on arrival after a trip to Thailand to complain, but this room faces the pool and if you like sunlight (like I do) everyone in the pool can see through into the bedroom if you have the curtains open. There is zero privacy at all. You have to choose between privacy or daylight. Ridiculous. We were there for only one night. I am not sure if I'll give this place a second chance, but our first impression was not a good one.",1
Warm and Excellent Service,Dennis L,"Hotel Manager, Kelson was most welcoming of us and ensured the check in and out process was smooth and fuss-free. The service was impeccable.

"Very comfortable room, helpful &  friendly staff.",stuffmatters,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Fort Canning. It has the grandeur and style you would expect starting with a warm and professional welcome. Rooms were very comfortable and well appointed including unusual touches such as the use of a smartphone to use during your stay including international telephone calls. We had a room at the back of the hotel facing the hill and as such the room was somewhat dark although this was not a major issue.   We chose a package that included a complimentary cocktail and aperitif in a reserved garden/lounge which was well worth doing providing as it did an opportunity to meet interesting fellow guests.   As with many 5 star hotels in Singapore it is well worth spending time researching special offers and deals on offer that arise as there can be a…,4

Perfection! Look no further !,coll612,"This hotel is one of Singapore’s best kept secrets. The hotel is located out of the hustle and bustle of Singapore’s shopping Mecca and is quite simply a sanctuary in the city. Conveniently located with a 5 minute walk to Clarke quay, and a wonderful walk around Fort canning park ( and perhaps a Battle box tour) will provide you with an amazing experience. The breakfast buffet is good but not as good as it has been in the past. The rooms are spacious, pillow menu, great in-food dining choices, 2 beautiful pools in which you usually have all to yourself ( Small 55 room hotel), I cannot recommend this hotel more highly.

is this called five star?,Anna Khin Kyawt,"This is a colonial building renovated to fit in rooms for hotel so it has lost its grandeur of original architecture inside. In a city state of Singapore the hotel is in a park called Fort Canning where they British troupes resided  in WWII. It is nice to see big trees in the park but you have to call taxi each time you go out for shopping or dining. The hotel itself is not so huge to enjoy though they have a nice small lap pool . The restaurant looks and sound like a canteen so we decided not to eat there. If they call this hotel five star , we are so spoilt and must look for more stars hotel .",3
Birthday Staycation with Hotel Fort Canning,Zee,"The stay at Hotel Fort Canning was absolutely wonderful!   My boyfriend and I booked a night to celebrate his birthday.   Front office manager, Kelson, who checked in for us was professional and personable. The Deluxe King room was clean and just nice for 2. Our favorite part of the room was the bathtub!   We love that we could use the $25 food credit from the flash deal at the restaurant and staff was very attentive as well. After noticing that both of us only ordered a flat bread for sharing, she gave us another portion to make sure it was enough for us!

An Oasis to relax in,Ruth B,"After a busy week in the centre of town, we spent a beautiful, peaceful long-weekend here.  Fort Canning is now a park, with a historic bunker where the decision to surrender Singapore to try and avoid loss of life was made, and some buildings still remain from the Fort's time as Army headquarters.     The area is not ""right-in-the-middle"" of the tourist venues, but close enough to still be part of the atmosphere of Singapore.   The Hotel Fort Canning building was originally a Country Club, then converted to be military headquarters during the war.   The building has a colonial feel about it, the rooms are spacious and modern, although one does need a driver's licence to work the modern light switches - they sequence through  several different options of lighting.

Unfortunately, this hotel was not close to the service we received and the rooms we stayed in Thailand.  We paid extra to stay in the room with a garden. The garden was not used at all and was merely a few plants. Nothing exciting. If staying at this hotel, do not bother paying extra for this.   There was no bathroom. A sliding door mechanism was used to separate the toilet and shower leaving no privacy within the bedroom. Everything could be seen outside. In fact, we used to use the toilet at the local mall due to the embarrassment of leaving a smell and being heard. My husband could not sit on the toilet properly as there was not enough leg room. If you shower, the…",2
The perfect escape,Ashmika P,"My friends and I were given a complimentary stay here for a night and from the moment we stepped in, we felt like we were surrounded in a lap of luxury with the beautiful hotel decor and open concept bedroom (the soaking tub would be the highlight of our room). With its exquisite amenities and the most relaxing facilities possible, I felt I could stay by the pool or in our room for well, forever. Everything was provided for or promptly available with a single call to the front desk and the experience of staying in a boutique hotel within Fort Canning felt so much more unique and intimate than staying in any other hotel in the city.  I'm still in awe at how secluded the hotel felt despite being a mere 10-minute walk from the main city. As such, all forms of dining and…",5
Stopover enroute to Australia,Quest273533,Great location staff very attentive and so helpful great facilities the pool area very quiet and relaxing. Beautiful gardens and lots if historical information to enjoy. Would stay again if visiting Singapore. Well worth a visit.,4
Beautiful historical hotel with lovely ambience,June T,"My third stay and always such a refreshing change from newer city hotels. The architectural details inspire, the beautiful rooms with gorgeous bathrooms always please. Breakfast at The Salon is good. They should definitely upgrade the music dock which only takes iPhone 4 and older iPads though!",5
Poor sound proofing. Lots of ants,cheuk,Poor sound proofing. Could hear people coughing in rooms nearby.  Lots of ants running in the room and in bed.  Sheets are torn and not very clean. I have dust allergy and I got rashes all over my body. Many of my colleagues in the conference slept poorly too.   The architecture is nice though.,3
An absolutely special experience!,Marie S,"We stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for four nights. The historical building is located in the very center of the beautiful Fort Canning Park right next to Clarke Quay (5-10 mins walk) and nearby Orchard Rd. We really enjoyed every single day at Hotel Fort Canning, great service, adorable staff members, a beautiful pool surrounded by the park and stunning hotel room interior and architecture. An oasis to calm down, relax and definitely the place to stay during a holiday in Singapore! Thank you for making these days so special! ",5
Lovely and Serene environment nestled in the heart of the city! Ideal for staycations :),vcn135,"Stayed here over the weekend. Was a lovely experience being a first timer and used to hotels such as Capella and MBS, I was not disappointed! The hotel lived up to its boutique hotel name and although what I used was a complimentary staycation voucher, I know I will be back for sure! Special mention to Manager Eric for his polite and excellent service rendered towards us! Kudos for having such staff on your team!",5
"Nice quiet hotel for a good getaway,",Yew Hon James C,"Nice quiet hotel for a good getaway. Right in the middle of fort canning park, it is so close to nature and it makes you feel away from the bustling city. Room is spacious and nice, We had a good anniversary stay with our daughter. Service was good and we enjoyed our stay. Thank you HFC for the nice room upgrade.    It is quite a walking distance to the nearest mrt stn and shopping mall. Not for those looking to shop/dine at their convenience.",4
Relaxing getaway,Dm_donahue,"We stayed here for a long weekend and we're very happy with the service and the room. We choose this hotel because it was a bit out of the way of the more family or hectic tourist traps while still close to everything in the city. It's central location is perfect for walking or using the MRT to get around. We sleep so well, the bed was great and the hotel was quiet. We loved the bathroom and the Nespresso was a nice touch. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay again. ",5
Great Getaway,nishpati,"Really beautiful place with clean and elegant rooms. Service was excellent! Really really enjoyed myself. It was so near the city and yet it felt so far away, quiet and different from everything else. the entire hotel was a destination on its own",5
Amazing customer service,Gayatri J,Every time I called the front desk for anything I was met with incredible politeness & promptness. Very professional and cheerful tone throughout - really top quality service. Huge land space surrounding the hotel giving an open feel that is rare in most Singaporean hotels. ,4
Nice Heritage Hotel!,Fearrow,"A very nice well-preserved heritage hotel. We stayed there for a night to celebrate my wife's birthday and the hotel staff did the extra mile to serve a slice of cake to our room. We had the biggest deluxe room overlooking the front facade of the hotel. The room itself is spacious and clean with good amenities such as a big bathtub, Nespresso machine, we easily felt at home instantly. Breakfast at the hotel was good for a muslim like us as we still have choices of breads, pastries, cereals, fruits selection though it would be better if they can cater for halal dining. We also enjoyed, the lush swimming pool area (there's 2 different pools). Overall, we would stay here again.",4
Great sneak out place!,Tra Tran,"Nice, nature friendly place. Love the room decoration, esp. restroom which views towards the front yard (remember to pull down the curtains ha ha :)). Front desk staff (Ms. Lee) was really helpful. Minus point for my stay here was the loud music from a company party on the hill next to my room (outside of hotel but still annoying till late night)",4
Oasis in the city,petrel1,"Thoroughly enjoyed the room, facilities, service and hospitality of hfc. The happy hour was a welcome addition to relax at the end of the day.  The pools were very enjoyable. Very few guests bothered to use them so it was almost like having them to yourself. ",5
Elegant and understated ,Jeanne R,We loved this hotel set in the beautiful Fort Canning park.  Service is excellent and the rooms are beautifully fitted out with a view to the park.  The location suited us just fine and we enjoyed the swimming pools. Who wouldn't?  Happy hour drinks and canapés on the terrace made it hard to leave in the evening. ,5
Nice surprise,Judyannechan,We went to this Hotel for lunch after visiting the Park.  We had a very delicious lunch.  And the staff was very nice and friendly.  It was quiet and very pleasant.  The Hotel is in a quiet location surrounded by greenery.  Very restful.  I understand that the Hotel used to be the Headquarters for the British Army during WWII.  I sat there musing about what it must have been like then.,4
Relaxing,sanishmathai,"Clean spacious and comfy room, nice calm and green surroundings,  good food and good staff. Perfect place for a staycation in Singapore, a real & quick escape from the mundane. Overall a great experience.",5
New Rooms! Warm Stay with Friendly Staff,SPU27,My wife and I had a delightful stay at Hotel Fort Canning after our wedding celebration. The staff at the hotel were warm and extremely hospitable. They had made special arrangements for us in the room by decorating it with rose petals. The rooms were clean and very new. I appreciated the updated technology used for lighting. It was most wonderful to have a bath tub in the room! Special thanks to the staff at the hotel for a memorable stay.,4
Top Notch Gem in Singapore,ElxLee,"First, I must say that my experience started with walking up levels of stairs to the hotel under the hot sun, which wasn't comfortable as you can imagine. However, I will say that the hotel was worth it!  Hotel Fort Canning looks great the moment you lay eyes on it. After all the building has a lot of history to it. The inside of the hotel is really impressive. At the reception, they sit you down to go through your stay, unlike those chain hotels which usually have standing counters. The customer service representative is very helpful and provides a personal touch.   When I got to my room, there was a cockroach in it. I wasn't alarmed given the spot the hotel is at, with lots of green surrounding it. However, it would be great if room servicing crew had checked to ensure…",5
"Beautiful, historic",NaniSG,"A lovely conversion from an old historic building. Rooms comfortable with high ceilings and surrounded by lush greens. Staff were attentive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!  For best stays, the corner rooms offer a little more space.",5
An oasis in Singapore,Tania03061964,"A beautifully outfitted hotel, HFC is an oasis in Singapore. It is tucked away and secluded in the botanical gardens but still walking distance to Orchard Rd and the hub-bub of town.  The staff were attentive friendly and extremely helpful, the rooms although small were lovely with a comfortable bed & pillows (always the bane of my existence when I travel) and the pool pristine.  Loved the complimentary phone that could be used for the duration of the stay including off-site when you are out & about - I have never had this before & all other 5star hotels should take note of this! Breakfast buffet had all you could want. The happy hour free drinks and canapés are a lovely way to end the day or start the evening.  Sadly we only had one night here, but would highly recommend this…",5
"HFC is, a top notch!",Maryson John,"Neither a notch above / below Conrads & Shangrilas; the hotel itself is a notch just as the Conrads could be. No woes experienced, like being over-attentive to the guests, nor under-attentive. Tried the buffet breakfasts, surely made for globe trotters. The entire ecosystem of the place including nature & people, ambience & décor, architecture & conduciveness to peace; seemed magically holistic in harmony. The experience is surely unique, given the extreme uniqueness of this one! Would I visit again? Of course & why not! Thanks to the wonderful Canning-ers who made the stay very very hassle-free!!",5
The way all hotels should be run...,308ktheh,"Spent two nights here for a special birthday celebration. While it is only a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road, the hotel sits in the middle of Fort Canning park which makes for a very peaceful and quiet stay. The rooms have a wonderful mix of heritage architecture, with all the modern amenities thrown in. The rooms are well maintained and generous. Staff were very obliging, excellent customer service all around. Bonus: 1. Free drinks and canapés for hotel guests from 6-7pm everyday; and 2. You get a smart phone with your room, free to use while in Singapore, unlimited data and free calls (even international).  Highly recommended.",5
Good,Ulf N,Thsi is a good located hotel with good service and good standard. Staff is very helpful and nice. It is also good facilites like the pool area. I will def come back in the future and recomend this hotel to my friends.,5

Perfect staycation!,Atikaysn,"Love the hotel - both interior and exterior.  Big comfortable bed, clean, great bathtub, modern concept. Great and sumptuous breakfast spread. Staffs are Friendly, check-in was a breeze. Amenities provided. Keep it up! ♥️ ",5
Excellent oasis in the middle of Singapore,Thomas H,"Hotel Fort Canning is situated in the Northwest corner of Fort Canning Park in the middle of Singapore. The location gives the hotel a special ambience of being secluded in the middle of the busy buzz of the city. The hotel itself is relatively small which gives it a very personal atmosphere. Our room had an open bathroom facing the north side of the park. The room was comfortable, with an excellent bed.",5
"Good gym, worst wifi",CreditCardWarrior,"Good gym. Love it.  However as a business traveller, the Internet connection in the room is equivalent to that which you experience in a third world country. Makes emails almost impossible. Would not stay here again due to the lack lustre infrastructure. It is not too much to ask for for a 5 star hotel to provide solid connection wifi to the room. Very disappointed.",1
Beautiful,Nathalie H,"Here is a beautiful hotel in the center of the city, the Fort Canning Park. The location is nice and quiet. The room (and bathroom!) was very nice. Breakfast buffet offers a lot of options. There are 2 different pools, one for swimming, one for relaxing! I will return to Hotel Fort Canning, for sure!",4
"Nice hotel, lovely location",Vickym830,"We stayed here for two nights as a break between flying home from the UK. We had not stayed here before but it looked good on the website. The room was very well appointed,with a small sitting area attached and a large bathroom. It had a king sized bed and was very quiet. The two swimming pools were large. Lots of seating available too.  There were  free drinks and nibbles for guests for an hour in the evening, which was a nice touch. Also in our room we had a smart phone which allowed us to make free international calls. What a plus!  The Nespresso machine also nice, with several capsules offered. Pity we didn't get enough milk. We had a few issues, however. The wifi was difficult to access and kept dropping out. . We left the hotel at 10am and returned at 2pm to find  the room…",4
Lovely hotel in a picturesque location,Nicky C,"Only stayed for a couple of nights but it was lovely, swimming pools are beautiful, staff are lovely and the food is outstanding! Can't fault the hotel at all, room was lovely complete with safe, roll top bath, air conditioning and electric curtains.   We loved the location in the park, however, some people may feel it's too far from the centre being 15 minutes walk away. Probably not suitable for the less mobile ad quite hilly around the area but taxis from the front door are readily available.  Perfect location for national museum of Singapore and Battlebox (both of which we recommend).   25 minute walk from gardens of the bay as well. When we return to Singapore we will stay here.",5
3.5/5,S102OOdaniell,"This was our hotel for our wedding reception, here are our thoughts:  Ambience: 4.5/5 Cleanliness: 5/5 Customer Service: 4/5 Location: 2.5/5 Value for Money: 3/5  The Good: Very quaint hotel, excellent ambience and good customer service.  The Bad: The climb up the hill to get there can be quite challenging, and parking here can be tough, would recommend to come here via cab or Grab/Uber.  The Bottom Line: It's quaint, prices are a bit steep, would come back at the right price. ",4
Great place to stay,Travel_Times987,"This hotel is in a great location, the garden room we booked was lovely albeit a bit tight on space for two cases. The garden was a treat we wanted to have so we could sit out in the evening when we got back, however other people use them for smoking so both nights we sat out we ended up either moving our seats around or going inside due so people smoking nearby.  The food prices were reasonable for a hotel, compared to some of the places in the centre, so definitely worth eating there. Wine is expensive. We were invited for free drinks and canapés between 6-7pm which was excellent, we went on our first night but not the second, unsure if this was a daily thing or a one off. The shower gel wasn't replaced, there were no robes and no iron.  The lights in the wardrobe were on…",5

great bath tub,ahtan123,"bath tub was really clean, staff was excellent, thank you for allowing for late check out so we can enjoy the bath tub some more. room service was good. the only negative was not the hotel's fault, there were some unsupervised children near the fish pond throwing rocks at the poor fishes, the security manager to his credit came to advice them to stop.",5

Amazing weekend gateaway,785andyt,Booked this hotel via Amex's promotional travel vouchers to celebrate my birthday and it was a splendid weekend. A comfy room at the lower ground just walking distance to the pool hanging out during the day time. Love the set dinner promotion and value for money. The desert's was just amazing. Spent both evenings at the bar which was exceptional with their 1 for 1 promotions. The highlight of the stay was on the last evening while spending a casual evening at the bar we were presented with a complementary birthday cake and drinks. My wife and me was astonished and surprised with the kind gesture of the staff and that make it very special for just the two of us.   I want to thank Maggie for assisting with the swift reservation over email and the surprise cake. Also not forgetting…,5
Perfect in every way,aussiegypsy51,"We were happy to find a hotel away from the plastic fantastic style high rise. This hotel is in an old historical building from the colonial era, but with modern amenities. It was spotlessly clean and comfortable, and situated in quiet lush gardens. The Battlebox is just opposite for history buffs.",5
Very Nice,Taze R,"Only stayed one night. Very nice room. We had the room with the king bed and office attached. Very clean and comfortable room. Good location too.

Wonderful experience,Ralph S,"Enjoyed the stay there for a total of 5 nights.  Breakfasts were superb, the rooms were excellent, the location was perfect with wonderful walking paths at the old fort, and the staff was gracious and helpful.

In a world of its own,AuntyMim,"The Hotel Fort Canning is tucked away on the hill on the very edge of the City surrounded by beautiful parkland.  This renovated 1920's Colonial building is delightful in that it is like living in a beautiful Old home but has all the mod cons.  After a very busy day of sight seeing, the Hotel was a haven. The Staff were wonderful, food delicious, the rooms a delight.   We were provided with a mobile phone for our use which included overseas calls as well as local calls, allowing me to phone home each day.  Also included was complimentary Happy Hour each evening and buffet breakfast.  The surrounding gardens and pools are also beautiful. We really loved staying here.",5

The mobile is for your own use to take when you are out and about in Singapore to use Google maps etc. Bottled water supplied free of charge each day. The hotel is situated in the middle of Fort Canning Park and although close to Train station and walking distance to Clarke Quay you feel like you are in the country.

"Ambience, tranquility, location and beauty",DocRah6,"This hotel is amazing and very classy. It is situated in the best location , wishing walking distance to Orchard road and the main MRT Dhouby Ghout. It costs $2.40 from Changi airport to this station and the hotel is 5 minutes walk. Exit out on arrive at Dhouby Ghout via B. Turn left towards Penang Road and there is a sign after you cross the traffic lights directing you left again to Fort Canning Park and after you approach and edit a tunnel you are at the hotel. Use the lift in the car park to head to the lobby. The rooms are immaculate and the customer service and staff presentation and service was exceptional.  There was a bath and shower in my room.

"Rooms, Amenities & Breakfast are Incredible!",Happy_Traveller_142,"This was our last stop on our honeymoon and was a perfect way to finish! The hotel features and amenities are faultless with gorgeous and spacious rooms, a stunning foyer with fresh flowers, amazing architecture, and 5-star service. The breakfast is by far the best I have ever had in a buffet and is worth every penny! The room comes with a free mobile phone for you to use during your stay which is extremely helpful and an added bonus! The only downfall I would say is that beverages are so over-priced... we would have loved to have a few cocktails or drinks by the pool but could not justify spending so much money. Other than that, it was amazing. The location is great too with walking distance to the marina area and also other major shopping centres. Fort Canning park is…",5
"Beautiful, historic hotel",roocarroll,I stayed in this hotel for two nights in July 2017. The hotel is beautiful. It's immaculately maintained despite being a historic old building.

Amazing Hotel,Jeanette H,"We really loved the hotel.  The room was very spacious & had the wow factor.  Could not fault any staff member as they were always very helpful, polite & professional.  Great location.  Would definitely stay here again.",5
Lovely room and helpful staffs,Juriani L,"We stayed in their Deluxe Garden Room as I need some space for my husband's birthday. Room was fabulous. Swimming pool is indeed quiet and beautiful. Kelson welcomed us from the start and he was very helpful with the 'luggages', arranging a birthday cake and attending to our enquiries. Will come back again!",5
"Urban feel, staff and interior was good.But windows can be tinted for more privacy.",Jiayu93,"The hotel was quite a distance from MRT and climbing flight of stairs is needed. Room was great, but lack of privacy as windows are not tinted therefore unable to enjoy the view, which is quite disappointing as its the key features of the bathroom. Breakfast live station was good, but overall lack of variety.",4
Lovely hotel in quiet setting,djhunter77,I stayed for three nights whilst attending a conference within the hotel. My room was lovely. It had plenty of space and a large bathroom. The lights and air conditioning were controlled by easy to use panels by the side of the bed. Breakfast was buffet style with an egg station and was nice. I used the swimming pool twice which was lovely and relaxing. Staff were very helpful and pleasant throughout my stay. This included facilitating me to have a shower and get changed in the evening before heading to the airport (I had checked out at 10am but wasn't flying until 10pm). The hotel is located with a park but it is only a 5-10 minute walk to Orchard Road. ,5
Beautiful hotel and friendly staff but not perfectly located,Jil M,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a very nice accomodation. First, we got an early check-in, which made us very happy after a 15h flight. Second, the rooms look so beautiful, they are not big but the bathroom and bed are very nice and confortable. Third, there were always complimentary drinks (wine and champagne and juice) with some canapés from 6 pm to 7 pm, which we appreciated very much.  The breakfast is very good, there is everything one needs. However, the location of the hotel is not perfect, it is a 10min walk from Doby Ghaut Station, which especially annoyed us in the late evening but all in all we had a very good stay at Fort Canning!",4
A Beautiful Experience,Lutfi D,"The climb up to the Hotel was a feat enjoyed, the service we received was commendable (they surprised my gf with a cake on her birthday and wishes from the service crew), the room was great (I chose HFC because it was surrounded by nature versus concrete) and the view we got was a beautiful one. We loved the bed and fell in love with the toilet (separate bath and standing shower with a rainforest head option, the toilet was huge and had beautiful design and views), it was her favourite part of the room. The swimming pools were lovely to hang and chill at night or even have a meal. Our only gripe was that it would be better if they served drinks and food even after 6 or 7pm as we ended up ordering via UberEats. The Gym was equipped with high-tech, high-end equipment but we did…",5
No room service. Other than that everything is ok.,Jamie,"Stayed 3 days and 2 nights - no room service was provided throughout the 2 nights at all despite pressing the make up room button and calling the housekeeping line to inform to come immediately. When we approached the front desk on the second night to enquire, we were told off for not calling them to confirm, when we actually did do so. Maybe because we're local so there was no urgency on their part to make an effort. See no point in them ""admonishing"" the housekeeping staff after we were no longer staying there because the damage was already done. As for the rooms, the bathroom is exquisite with all its marble flooring and high ceiling, while the bedroom is average for its coziness and some furniture were a bit old. Please note that rooms are NOT SOUNDPROOF so please request…",3
My Favourite Hotel. ,JoeA3,"The staff are fantastic, specifically Kelson, Vinesh and Eric in front office, Grace in the dining room and Ruby and Erica behind the bar. Eric was great calming my wife when she lost her mobile phone. The birthday cake for my wife organised by Kelson and Grace was a fabulous gesture. The hotel is well located, the rooms are nice and I love the swimming pools, however the people make it really special. The only hotel I will stay in Singapore. Good Singapore Sling as well. ",5

Exceeded my expectations!,Shaun W,"Hotel Fort Canning is an elegant, intimate hotel that differs from the many business hotels, which makes it perfect and ideal for a quiet, peaceful stay away from the bustling city.   The Deluxe room was perfect even though it was considered their standard room. The room was tastefully designed and comfortable while the bathroom was very clean and modernized.   Having booked directly from the Hotel’s website, there was also complimentary aperitifs in the evening from 6-7pm (though because of our dinner plans, we did not have the opportunity to do so for the two nights that we stayed) and $25 dining credit included in the room rates.  I would like to thank all the staff who have contributed to a wonderful stay experience (and successful proposal) at the Hotel Fort Canning. …",5
Old World Charm,HeleneG201,"Hotel Fort Canning is a beautifully restored building. The Customer service is just wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are lovely and beds are very comfortable.  The location is great if you like to be away from the hustle and bustle. If you struggle psychically with climbing up steep hills then getting in & out of this hotel will be a challenge. There are many, many steps to be climbed from street level to get to the Hotel entrance, I found combined with the intense hot weather a cab was required both ways each day to see the sights of Singapore. The garden and surrounds are just stunning to see.",4
More than  a Happy Hour.......,hughy47,"Alcoholic drinks are very expensive in Singapore compared to Australia. What a wonderful surprise to find that for an hour sometimes more, each day, free wine and canapes are offered to hotel guests. We took advantage of this each evening before dining in The Salon. The Dinner menu offers a great range of choice. All meals we had were beautifully presented and deliciously tasty. Breakfast choices were also very extensive and delicious. A complimentary Smart phone came with our room. Free international calls! No need for own phone . Google maps while out and about meant we always knew where we were. Tastefully modernized inside, the building was originally a British Military Administration Headquarters dating from around 1930. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay",5
The shower was our favourite part,Sammy P,The room is amazing with the bathtub in the middle of the room. Its a very well set up room but lacks floor space. Love the outside balcony. The service was very efficient   Only thing they could improve on is the room service food. The plate up of the food ect.   I work for a hotel back in Melbourne in the kitchen so I have high expectations when it comes to room service food.  But overall a very good experience. Slightly pricey but worth it if you money to spend.,4
Gorgeous hotel in superb location,leeh989,"Hotel Fort Canning is a gem on a hill in central Singapore surrounded by vegetation where squirrels race along past the pool and you could be forgiven for thinking you were a million miles from the busy metropolis. We had a fabulous pool view room with all mod cons and appointments. Staff were charming and we enjoyed complimentary drinks and delicate canapés each evening on the deck surrounded by greenery. The food was delicious served by gracious staff who made us feel so welcome. The fascinating WWII Battlebox lies beneath the hotel and the tour is well worth doing.

It is a small intimate hotel, which serves complimentary aperitifs from 6:00 - 7:00 pm.  A wonderful detail and reminiscent of the Singapore of a more genteel era. We arrived at about 9:00 am from an early Singapore Airlines flight from Amsterdam. Our room was not ready, but we were made welcome and comfortable and were able to access our room well before the usual 2:00 pm check in time. This hotel is perfection.

Elegant refurbished old world hotel,johnd552016,"Everything about HFC is elegant and beautifully appointed. The extra large bath in each room is a symbol of all the little extras that make this place so good. The building was a the British Officers and then Japanese Officers Quarters during WW2 and has a sense of history about it. You can explore the bunkers within the old Fort Canning as well as roam around the beautiful parks. It is close to Orchard Rd, and Clarke Quay. Very central to get almost anywhere in Singapore with Dhoby Gaut MRT station and interchange only 300m walk. A free mobile telephone to take aropund Singapore with maps and free international calls was a great bonus.",4

Great stay in Fort Canning,KirstyKelly,"My husband and I moved to Singapore and spent our first few nights in Hotel Fort Canning. What a great start to our new life in Singapore! We had a Deluxe King room, which while on the small side, was very clean, stylish and had a beautiful bathroom and view. The room came with a hair dryer, safe, coffee machine (the George Clooney one!) fridge, with complimentary water, and TV with a range of channels. The rest of the hotel was just as great as the room. We ate breakfast everyday - note it is cheaper to book breakfast when you arrive for check in, I believe we paid $70 for two people for two days) and also had a lunch, which we agreed was very reasonably priced.

Wedding proposal at hotel fort canning,Francoislow,"I booked a deluxe suite with garden patio at Hotel Fort Canning to propose to my gf. I requested for a early check-in at the reception as I need to do some decorations to surprise my gf. I am so surprised and thankful towards the receptionist for accommodating to my request and manage to check in at 9:45am ! The room and garden is really clean and beautiful ! The room is really quiet at night, suitable for couples who are looking for a romantic getaway. Needless to say, my gf say 'yes' to my proposal ! She is so impressed with the room ! We are definitely coming back again. I didn't get the name of the receptionist who manage my booking. But thank you so much for ensuring my proposal went smoothly ! ",5

Singapore sojourn,JustineGarvey,"My husband and I recently stopped off in Singapore on the way home to Australia, my first time. We had 4 fabulous days at Hotel Fort Canning - delightful staff who were immensely helpful, gorgeous converted colonial building - the garden room was well appointed and had our own private garden area with day bed, and I loved the 2 pools and tranquility of the park in the midst of a hustling city!  We will be back soon. ",5
"A ""little oasis""",Lillianandian E,"Hotel Fort Canning is a ""little oasis"" is n busy Singapore.  It's location is on the edge of the park and you are surrounded by gardens.  The room is spacious and very modern in a British Colonial building.  Service by everyone was most appreciated.  Breakfasts were excellent and covered many tastes.  It is also close to the Singapore Museum, Orchard road is within walking distance and Raffles is around the corner.",4
City break ,julie5t,What an amazing time we had the staff couldn't do enough I lost my handbag didn't know I had lost it until the receptionist appeared with it in our room Set inside a park 10mins walk to Clarke quay safe to walk through full of people jogging could not rate it higher like Raffles without the eyewatering prices still within old colonial buildings absolutely brilliant ,5
Wonderful one-night stay in Hotel Fort Canning,Ridleysretro,"Nice hotel, quiet, away from all the buzz in the city. Full of greenery. The toilet was lay down with marble tiles and walls, with big bathtub. Good one-night stay. The room was slightly smaller than what I had expected, but still good enough for a couple.",5
Family Staycation,Hui Peng T,Good location and the staffs are helpful. Room clean and tidy. Requested few items from the housekeeping and they sent it to my room within 10 mins. Breakfast varieties not much and the breakfast timing ends too early.,5
GIRLS STAYCATION,CatBlowers,"Brilliant colonial hotel right in the heart of the city yet so peaceful. A tranquil sanctuary!  The rooms were very colonial, tasteful decor fitting of the era of the building and respectful of its immense history. Fort Canning is a wonderful setting and we had a wonderful day walking around the gardens and a fantastic historical tour in the battlebox with our tour guide 'Mel' The setting of the pools was lovely and peaceful. Loved hearing the cicadas singing! Clean tranquil hotel. Wonderful staff, attentive and on hand whenever you need! Great location to go to orchard road for shopping and eating and close to raffles hotel area too. Perfect location.",5
Lovely pool view and peaceful retreat for family.,ohfamilysingapore,"Good location, easy to walk out to orchard Road, friendly staff and relaxing ambience. Nice personal touches of free drinks from 6-7 pm for guests to mingle and unwind. Kid friendly environment as pool was quiet and safe.",4
"Great room, pity about the ""view""",richardmurias,Nice property. Well appointed room. Very poor location of the largest rooms in the hotel. These rooms should have been at the end of the property overlooking the pool or own the top floor overlooking the city.,4
Superb colonial Hotel,Jarvisfamily_11,"Super oasis in the city - really chilled and staff are superb , would welcome a light snack shop inside as restaurant a little formal but there is a large Mall nearby so no problem , pool small and only a few beds but not busy so no problem , great hotel with character and very clean",5
Excellent for Staycation,jeremiahona,"There are several things to love about Hotel Fort Canning. First would be its location as it is centrally situated but still secluded within Fort Canning Park. The location alone makes HFC an excellent hotel to stay in as it is like a small palace within a massive courtyard. Whenever I go for staycations, I always want to have that sense of exclusivity but we all know that it's often akin with an expensive price tag. HFC gives you that exclusivity without burning a hole in your pocket. Lastly, as a former hotelier and currently in the customer service line, I am very particular with the service that a hospitality institution provides and HFC has exceeded my expectations. To add on, their hallways and rooms have that subtle yet pleasant aroma, they smell amazing!",5
wonderful location! Nice journey!,Deanna P,Everything was fine. Location really out of the confusion but in any case confortable to the center. Nice and professional staff.  Room Clean. Good breakfast. Nice location.  beutiful swimmingpool. Perfect place to get a relaxing stay!,5
Awesome anniversary celebration staycation,Charlane_Yu,"As a makeup artist in Singapore, I have visited a lot of hotels. HFC is one of my fav because of its beautiful colonial yet modern architecture. We stayed in the premier delux room. Room is big, love the ceiling to floor window, makes the room more spacious and bright. open concept bathroom with marble interior design is just beautiful and calming. Love that the room has got so many mirrors, no need to squeeze with anyone to do your makeup or check your outfit!   The bed is quite comfortable.   Sound proofing is not the best though. can hear people talking outside the room.  Will love to come back here again!",5
Hotel Fort Canning,Murray,"A fantastic hotel set in Fort Canning Park. The rooms were smallish but very well decorated and set out. All facilities were included - free WiFi, etc. The 2 pools were great - one lap pool and the other a large standard pool.  The free drinks and nibbles night was very enjoyable and we got to meet other guests.  Highly recommended.",5
Hotel Fort Canning,169wayne,"Our room was lovely, the staff are amazing and nothing was too much trouble, especially as we had missed a flight and arrived late. The hotel has great ambiance and beautiful food. We stayed with family members, including a healthy 90 year old Mum and all in different rooms. Everone at the hotel did everything possible to ensure we were all comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5
Stunning,Trisha G,Two day stay in Singapore at Fort Canning Hotel.  Hotel is a beautiful old world charm building with modern facilities set in lovely gardens.  Room was fantastic.  Best bathroom I've ever seen. Great views over city from huge bathtub.  Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  Restaurant had delicious authentic Singapore dishes.  Happy hour where you help yourself to free wine and juices was terrific.  Close to Orchard Road shopping.  Highly recommend.,5
A fusion of Asia and England,Ian M,This hotel is located on the grounds of an old British Fort. The hotel has some elements of old school charm a  bit lost in clinical modernity. The rooms are large and well equipped. The modern lighting and heating systems are more annoying than competent Does no one read in bed anymore? All I want is a simple reading light by the bed! All calls are free and so is the bottled water. Gym and spa are excellent although the times shown inn the room for the spa were wrong. Breakfast is an expensive add on at over £20 and while ok was limited. Staff were all kind and courteous without being obsequious.  I would stay here again. recommended.,4

Colonial Charm with Friendly Staff,FabTravelZZ,"It's a beautiful colonial hotel surrounded in a lush garden but don't be fooled, in room amenities are very high tech. Rooms are very cozy. Upon check in we were greeted by this polite staff and welcoming us to the check in desk. Check in process was very efficient.  If you love privacy and quiet surrounding this is the hotel to be. It's walking distance to MRT station but hot weather might put you off or if you are carrying lots of shopping bag you might find it difficult to walk. Anyway hailing public transport are so convenient in Singapore now.  We love the pools as well, two big pools to choose! ",4
Urban Oasis,SimonSanDiegoCA,"I would say Hotel Fort Canning is the opposite of Marina Bay Sands in many ways.  I stayed at MBS Oct 2016 and HFC May 2017.  MBS is busy, with towers of hotel rooms, connected to the mall, conference center, and casino.  HFC is a much smaller hotel, with a really intimate feel.  The hotel is inside Fort Canning Park.  The park itself is an urban oasis - lots of greenery and trails.  It was great staying at HFC and being able to take a run along the trails in the morning.  You can make it a short run or take lots of different side paths to make it a much longer run.  I really enjoyed running to the Raffles House.  The view up there was precious.  Actually, you can see the MBS from there.  The hotel has a reasonable restaurant with a very friendly staff.  Breakfast buffet was…",5

"Lovely hotel, just a few minor problems...",Joyce,"We recently spent 1 night at Hotel Fort Canning to celebrate my partner's birthday. The reception was welcoming and we checked in without a fuss, one of the staff even brought in a slice of cake with a personalised birthday card for my partner. That was very thoughtful and we were pleasantly surprised.  However, the front office staff did not brief us about the timing for breakfast during our check-in. We had to ask them ourselves after check-in before he informed us about the timing for breakfast, and the $25 F&B credit we were entitled to. I feel that this should be explained to us earlier during check-in.  We booked a Garden Deluxe room and the room was clean and comfortable. We did not have a very good sleep however, due to the sliding door of the wardrobe which couldn't be…",4
Tremendous service and gorgeous setting for our Wedding Day,JX Ho,"We were so well taken care of by the staff - especially Banquet Manager, Johnathan and the rest of his team - throughout the day. From our lovely reception held at The Salon and then a lunch buffet catered at the Glass House, and lastly our dinner banquet hosted at the main attraction of this property - The Grand Marquee.  Hotel rooms were excellent as well - we stayed at the Governer's Suite which was humongous and very beautifully laid out. A number of our guests also stayed in the Deluxe Rooms which were equally exquisite. Overall decor of the hotel is very beautifully done, combining the old world charm of Singapore's colonial architecture combined with modern world amenities to make our stay very enjoyable.",5
Serene Escape in Bustling City,LadyTraveller87,"What a lovely hotel! Surrounded by the wonderful Fort Canning Park, this is a centrally located hotel but in very tranquil settings.   Laden with history this is a gorgeous building and the room conversions have done this justice! My room, whilst small, sported a huge bathroom with separate bath and shower overlooking the park hills. The room was filled with mod-cons, although sadly my Nespresso machine didn't work. The room came with a ""Handy"" - a mobile phone device where local calls and international calls (to certain counties) are included in the room price, it also as Google Apps including Maps and can be used as your personal device throughout your stay. Completely revolutionary in my eyes and made the world of difference to my stay in Singapore. I also used it to book…",4
An absolutely fantastic hotel!!,Jenny C,"The hotel will surpass all of your expectations- great location, ambience, staff and cuisine.

Great Building and OK Room,7September,"Despite the great pictures of the building the room and service are simple and nice but certainly not luxury as it pretends to be.  What we enjoyed is having a hand phone available during our stay, that was a nice pleasant surprise.",4
Beautiful historic hotel,erin5432,"Having previously lived in Singapore, we thought the hotel and location would be perfect for us and we were not wrong.  We loved the peaceful park location convenient to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, Orchard Rd and the City Hall area.  It's a beautiful building too - much more atmospheric than a shiny glass tower. We were travelling with our 3 children, so had connecting rooms with a lovely view of the park from the bathroom.  The deluxe room was small but perfectly adequate while the premium king room was much more spacious. Both were very comfortably furnished and had everything we needed. The hotel was very busy when we arrived on Sunday but was much quieter and more relaxing during the week.  The kids enjoyed the pool, although it could do with a covered area with table/chairs so I could…",5
A modern slant to rooms in an old style building,Mr. Bushtracker,"the modern rooms in old building! this was not what we were expecting; sigh; the room is good; but all the bathroom facilities are not separated. this was not comfortable for my wife and I; perhaps its targeted to ""younger""clients , everything else was up to scratch; breakfast was excellent , as was the staff;",4
A very comfortable and peaceful stay in a very busy city.,scirpaceus,"We wished we could have had time to make more of the hotel, for instance we did not get round to enjoying the swimming pool.  But we thought the breakfasts splendid and the dinners excellent and not expensive.  Our room was very comfortable and quiet. The service was first-rate and the staff very friendly and helpful.",5
Charming hotel,monnie88,"I booked this room for my daughters. They both stayed at this hotel for a few nights and said it was really lovely. Apparently everything about it was good - they said the room was luxurious, the pool was divine and the food was very above average but apparently there were two things that made it a little special. The first was the fact that it was located in the middle of a lovely parkland away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The second was the staff courtesy - apparently quite outstanding.  When I go to visit my daughter next I will definitely stay at the Hotel Fort Canning.",4
Great location in a park,xyztraveler1965,"Nice hotel in a park. Small gym and pool area but decent rooms. Bathroom is on the exterior wall which is a little weird but many hotels in Singapore have that arrangement. Staff was not as helpful as I expected. They need to have a map that shows how to walk to city, walk to metro, etc.",4
I am now accustomed to the Hotel Fort Canning it fits like a glove,Neil_GPerth,I am Australian and I live on the coast but on the edge of a forest by the beach. So I like the water and the trees.  Hotel Fort Canning is my place as it has the pool with the forest right beside the hotel. The other thing that I like is air. My room at Hotel Fort Canning has a door and a balcony. My Chines friends thing that I am not hip as you need glitz glamour and lots of activity.  I think that I need the opposite.,4
Peaceful break within the city,484VArends,"Spend there for a small staycation. Excellent staff and the hotel is really something different.

We will be staying again!",5
Great hotel,Cloud v,"I stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for two nights as our team had Aerotropolis Seminar there.  The building itself, the surrounding park and the rooms are just great. The facilities of the hotel are still great, although it's obvious that the building exists for some years already. We stayed in one of the Deluxe Rooms and enjoyed the exclusive design and interior a lot. Welcome reception with drinks and snacks, complimentary coffee and tea in the room, and free WIFI are just some to be mentioned....  However, the location is soo secretive that even a taxi driver can lost their way coming to the hotel. Nevertheless, I enjoyed our stay at Hotel Fort Canning very much and would not only recommend it anyone else but also go there again!",4
First time stay at Fort Canning hotel,Aja L,"Front office are very friendly. Very helpful also in explaining all the details of the vouchers and where all the facilities are.

A lady staff sitting around front office area I believe she's someone from management or maybe the FOM was talking very loud while she was discussing with whatever matter she's discussing about with another management staff also too I believe, speaks so loud until I have to ask the front office lady who's assisting me on checking out to speak a little bit louder. Worst in Singlish accent. It's a very quiet  lobby in an old colonial building. I believe u can imagine how her voice trembles the whole atmosphere. Also I want to touch on the breakfast waitress. Im not sure whether you…",5

Spacious hotel amidst beautiful gardens,Julia R,"The hotel is located on top of a hill set amongst beautiful gardens which provide both a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, and some lovely walks. The reception and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and spacious with a stunning marble bathroom and a huge freestanding bath. We also had a little sunroom with a very comfortable chair. There was a free yoga class on Sunday morning and we had the entire pool to ourselves for our 4 day stay. The buffet breakfast selection was great and the bar, although expensive, did have quite an extensive list.   My tip would be to take the some of the guided tours offered to learn about the history of Fort Canning Park and make the most of the amazing gardens.",5

Great location. Lovely room,Jamban28,"The hotel is located in Fort Canning Park. It is a lovely area and very quiet considering you are right in the middle of the city. We were able to walk everywhere including Orchard Road, Chinatown and Clarke Quay. The rooms were comfortable and the staff at the hotel were always helpful. Good facilities too including a coffee machine in the room. The best extra had to be the Handy device. This was a smart phone with local maps and guides that you could take around with you and even use for phone calls. This was extremely useful for us. I would definitely recommend staying here for the location and the facilities.  ",5

A good friend said stay in city & then for a long time I toyed with idea of staying fort canning hotel.  My sister stayed hereand she loved it so I gave it a go & I loved it.  I loved the history of the place & the style of rooms.  I really love Singapore it's full of surprises and hotel fort canning is one of the great surprises of Singapore.  Formerly British officers accomodation its built above a massive World War Two bunker that played a pivotal role in surrender of city.  Love history stay here.

Everything else was great - from the front desk professionals, to the complimentary drinks for in-house guests in the evening just as the sun was setting along with some canapes,the generous breakfast spread, and the location which is well connected to the park and spice garden + the Singapore National Museum.  Overall a relaxing and memorable stay...my daughter loved it!",4
Comfortable stay,huili_goh,Room was comfortable but the aircon was not cold enough.

Only mix up was receptionist telling us we hadnt prepaid our breakfasts which in my jetlagged state I was unable to challenge until I found my paperwork and showed another staff member the next day. We did receive a refund for the breakfast we didnt have.  We also appreciated access to a shower on our day of departure given we had a late flight.  Would recommend staying at this hotel.

Nice hotel on the hill,franklee8,"My fiancee and I decided to book a stay at this hotel after reading excellent reviews from others online. Indeed, the hotel has a modern and colonial feel. Perhaps because of this, our room has a high ceiling and the balcony is turned into a bathroom, which offers panoramic view of the Orchard area. However, we could not adjust the air-conditioning to above 23 deg C, so we turned off it off for a while because we felt it was too cold. Other than that, the hotel facilities are excellent (we tried the pool and the gym) and the frontdesk staff are attentive and friendly. I would recommend this hotel if you are intending to experience something different from typical hotels in Singapore.",4
Beautiful Hotel in wonderful location,karamarr,"We booked this hotel as it is not on a busy street, but in the Fort Canning gardens.

The check-in was good, with our bags being taken to our room whilst we completed check-in.  As I had booked directly through the hotel we were offered a reduction of $25 on any drinks or food purchased through the hotel, which was a nice surprise,  They have drinks each night for the hotel guests, with canapes provided which was very enjoyable.

Hotel Fort Canning,glennm191,"Hotel reviews usually sound the same. So. Everything was perfect. This hotel and especially its staff made our stay the best anywhere in the world. This is not a cold, impersonal place to stay where the staff treat everyone nicely. This is a place where everyone on staff goes out of their way to make you feel special. The staff could not be helpful enough for our many requests and enquiries especially regarding the seeing of the local sights. Any time we approached them they excelled at meeting our wishes. The room was great and all we could ask for. Comfortable, well furnished and worthy of the rest of this 5 star hotel. The location is central to all Singapore has to offer and the hotel has a significant historical heritage that its in park setting enhances. I can't recommend…",5
So Relaxing: Oasis in the city,cosycottager,"This place is SO relaxing.  The boutique hotel is right is in the city but it feels quiet and secluded because of its location in marvellous greenery of the Fort Canning Park.  Love the fantastic surroundings!  Great walks in the park.  Love the historic architecture of the hotel and well maintained outside areas are green and lush.     Free drinks and snacks at happy hour are am extra bonus.   Buffet breakfast was a good spread.  Limited dining options but you can walk 5 minutes down the hill to the National Museum of Singapore which has 2 restaurants inside, both good quality.  Excellent service overall too, especially at reception.  They were very helpful with all our questions and bookings for restaurants.",5

The room was clean and the hotel employees were kind. ",5
Dull but Good,sheira_shs,"I loved the location of the hotel. Central and surrounded by loads of green. After five days at the hotel, and you pretty much covered everything in the hotel, the hotel becomes dull and boring. Breakfast choice was plain and nothing exciting.

Overall, it is a good hotel BUT not great.",3
Above expectations!,Nicholas_TSQ,"The service from the front desk to the housekeeping was warm and friendly. The room was clean, cosy, and exactly as in the pictures, although a little smaller than expected. The hotel isn't located in the middle of all the attractions you might want, but its secluded location makes it a great place for a stay-cation and a hideaway from the bustling city. The complimentary drinks provided in the evening is a good bonus as well. Breakfast buffet , although limited in choices, was fantastic otherwise.",5
Nice stay in the mid of the botanic garden of Singapore,beefeater2017,Nice Hotel with a colonial touch. Placed in the mid of the botanic garden in Close range to Orchard Road and Clarke's key. Rooms with nice view. Food and breakfast very tasty and with a rich choice of several dishes.

Love This Place,BevWalker,"Hotel Fort Canning is a beautifully restored colonial building in a stunning tropical setting.  Chose this hotel because of the history surrounding it and also because we did not want a modern glitzy hotel experience.    This hotel was delightful.  It was like stepping back into a Somerset Maugham novel.  Our room was good, looking out onto that magnificent park, although the housekeeping issue should be addressed.  It seems to have been an issue for a long time, and there was a lot of dust on the floor of our room and also in other areas, including the lobby.    The restaurant served pleasant food that didn't break the bank.  Breakfasts were great, including a lot of different breads, and both Western and Asian items. Loved the way a lot of the hotel rooms and public areas…",4
Great swimming but the rooms are not for light sleepers,zzzzzzzek,"The swimming pools are wonderful due to the surrounding trees and quietness.   Unfortunately, we stayed in a Deluxe Room on the second floor and I hardly caught any sleep due to the blanket that is way too thick such that you'll be sweating even with the air-con at full blast. Furthermore, the door is not soundproof, so you'll hear it every time someone enters or exits any of the rooms along the same corridor.   I hope they put some padding on the doors so that they don't slam.  On the plus side, their staff are friendly.",2
Our favourite Singapore hotel,Jessie T,"Quiet, tucked in greenery, great service usually. This was our 3rd or 4th stay in the last year. Yes we love this place!   However, on this visit, the room was dusty. There was visible dust on the floor when we checked in (areas under the table & arm chair). But this issue was solved when we alerted one of the cleaning crew & he used a wet dust mop to clean the dust away. Wasn't too impressed with the fact that there was dust in the first place.   Gave this feedback during check out & they said they'll be fixing this.   Everything else was almost perfect! Love the pool, room & service from staff was excellent! We didn't get the breakfast buffet as we wanted to try brunch places nearby. ",4

While exploring the grounds, it felt as though we were staying in a colonial retreat as the Fort Canning area is secluded.The lobby wasn't busy or noisy. Had some trouble finding the gym as there were no proper signages directed towards the gym. We sorta walked from ballroom to ballroom in search of the gym which was supposed to be situated on the same floor. Overall, the environment was all-around calming and chilled. Would definitely come back :)",5
my favourite place in Singapore,Tim K,"The staff are so friendly, the rooms are spacious but they start feeling like your own after a day or two. It's hidden in a beautiful park right in the centre of the city. I stayed there mostly for business, it's perfect.",5
Celebrates husband's birthday!,Claris l,"Awesome room and hotel staffs. The hotel prepare us a complimentary birthday cake for my husband and a card from the hotel. The services is at the top-notch, the environment is quiet and relaxing. The experience is great. Definitely going back and recommending my friends. The restaurant serves great food with very reasonable prices!",5
Super accommodation and service,Alison H,"Very accommodating to get us into our room early. Lovely room and bathroom with great views and peaceful surroundings. Superb leisure pool and additional lap pool which we used for daily fitness. Ideal location,best we have ever stayed in Singapore with only a short walk to MRT, shopping centre, tourist attractions, etc. Complimentary buddy phone for duration of stay and wine and  canapes served to guests daily was a nice touch. Couldn't fault this hotel or staff and will definitely stay here again.",5
Away from the city,Oynnad,"Rooms were spacious enough for a couple with 1 bag each. Bathroom was equipped with both a rain show and standing bathtub, hot water was consistent. Hotel located among greenery of Fort Canning, and a good 10 min walk down the hill to the city.",5
Calming & cosy!,Farah Dee,"My first time here and I must say that the service is tip top. The hotel was located at a hill and it was so calming while I was relaxing at the balcony of the room.  The toilet was huge and there was even a bath tub! However, the floor is a tad too slippery! Not really safe if you have kids! I, as an adult, was also scared of falling.   Apart from that, everything else is nice!",4
Excellent staff and lovely oasis in a city stay,Catherine J,"Fast and efficient check in at 12 midnight. City view over park from bathroom which was huge bathroom including deep bath, rain shower head and all amenities that are needed. Large floor to ceiling window with electric controlled curtains for privacy.  We had buffet breakfast included which catered for all tastes. Coffee and tea are self serve, coffee from a mahine but was pretty good, Eggs all styles, pancakes, roti prata, etc cooked on request. Eggs benedict not good but all else excellent.  Aperitifs provided free each evening from 6 to 7 incl red, white and proseco wine, plus small snacks. Snacks were just passable but good quality wine. Good times meeting other guests.  Pools are great and surrounded by views of park. Some noise from city builders but not that intrusive.…",4
Elegant oasis in green,Mona,"The hotel is build in colonial style and situated in the Fort Canning park in the centre of Singapore. Rooms are spacious, well decorated with very comfortable beds. Staff is very friendly and capable.",4
Oasis in the middle of busy Singapore,DavidVR84,"This is a very nice hotel in the centre of Singapore. It is set on a hill surrounded by nice walking paths and trees allowing you to hear birds in the morning which is very unique for Singapore. The facilities are nice and modern with a good pool, gym and restaurant. The rooms are small but well appointed. If they could make a good coffee then it would top it off. ",4
Absolutely fantastic hotel,Karen H,Absolutely gorgeous hotel. Location was perfect and the parks around the hotel made it an enjoyable walk to the shopping areas. We had trouble with our room when we first arrived but this was easily rectified. The food served at the hotel was great and we really enjoyed the free drinks and canapés each night. Would happily stay here again.,5
A Nightmarish birthday staycation,Irene D,"Due to time constraint, this year I had booked a staycation for my birthday instead of going to overseas. So in January, I had booked and paid in full for the stay.   Prior to the booking, I had read about all the positive comments and feedback in Agoda.com. And because I have wanted to relax and chill in a quiet place, I decided to go ahead with the booking.   However, the nightmare started the moment I went to the Front Desk around 4:00pm on 14 March 2017.   The Front Desk was condescending. I would only use debit card in Singapore and I have used it for all my travel bookings, rooms and purchases for many years. The Front Desk rejected my card, saying that they only accept credit cards. I told them if a foreigner brings in a debit card, they would not know the difference.…",1
Nice interesting hotel,hungry-sumo,"A renovated colonial building, in the middle of a big park The room was nice, good design. The toilet seat fell off which wasn't great The bar happy hour was quite reasonable  The pool area is a bit lifeless and empty - they should put a bar in there Free phone calls from the in room cellphone you can take around the city when exploring Breakfast was ok - no frills but ok The surrounding park is great for running - There is a lots of information on tourist boards around the park which is nice  Overall a nice stay ",4
Top of the line !!!,inesc63,"Loved everything about the hotel. Location? Hop on Hop off just across the street and hotel is connected to a shopping mall. Room was clean, comfortable and with a nice view. We paid a little extra than the basic room and it was really worth it (superb breakfast, access to lounge, complementary ironing, etc., etc.)  Not to mention all the pieces of art displayed throughout the hotel.  Just delightful !!!",5
Nice location,Stephen M,Hotel was a good location and very quiet. Swimming pool is not that big. Shopping in Singapore is very messy. Rooms are very good.  You get a mobile phone to use free of charge from the hotel which is a great idea. Taxi drivers get lost going to the hotel though,3
Lovely Quite Location,Karen Allen,"Situated in the Fort Canning gardens this is a beautifully located Hotel but with the advantage of being within walking distance to Clarke Quay. Right from arriving and throughout our stay the staff were all very friendly and most helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The ""Happy Hour"" free drinks was a very nice touch. We had a Deluxe Garden room with a free standing bath in the bedroom, the only down side was that the toilet and shower shared a connecting sliding glass door situated actually in the bedroom so no privacy, but don't let this put you off, as the room itself was lovely with lots of extra touches. The surrounding gardens are stunning steeped in history and just perfect to spend time wandering round. We ate in the restaurant a couple of times, the food was very…",4
A very nice peaceful historical choice ,Jonathan W,This is a good chance for those who are looking for someone outside the hustle and bustle of Singapore . The hotel is very pleasant with plenty of greenery surrounding it . The only minus is you need to get a taxi to go anywhere but the beauty and ambience of the hotel compensate for this minor inconvenience . ,4
Good hotel only let down by cleanliness,Daniel M,"All round the hotel is very good and, compared to other similar hotels in Singapore, good value for money.   There are two great outdoor pools and an excellent gym - breakfast is also of a good standard.  The one negative was that my bathroom was infested with ants - I'd come into the room, and I'd find everyday the whole sink table top full ants crawling all over it.  I would stay here again.",4
Tranquil Location in the Heart of the Action!,1967debbief,"If you are looking for a convenient hotel, walking distance to Orchard Road one side and Robertson Quay/Clarke Quay the other + easy access to MRT stations then this is hard to beat.  Not only is it so close to these major shopping and/or restaurant hubs but it's in such a quiet/tranquil location.  On top of that, the hotel itself is a beautifully restored heritage building which still retains it's colonial style. We had a Deluxe Double room which was excellent value for money by Singapore standards - if I had to give any negative feedback about the room then it would be that it was just a little small if you have two big cases, however, the beautiful light and airy marble bathroom more than makes up for it!  The rooms were clean but just in the general areas used, little…",4
Why did I know about this place??,Jenhendo,While doing some research I came across the Hotel Fort Canning and it looked appealing from first sight. I have been going to Singapore for many years and stayed in a lot of different hotels - this hotel has a great history in the middle of Fort Canning Park and has only been operating as a hotel since 2011. Having stayed here just recently this is now my only choice for future visits!  The hotel is grand without being stuffy - the staff are wonderful and welcoming.  Room service was amazingly fast and the food was very good.  We loved the pool area and were fortunate to be staying on the same level as the freeform pool so it was just a short walk down the hall and straight into the beautiful pool.  The other large lap pool is just down a few steps from here.  There are towels…,5
Business stay in the park,David C,"I enjoyed the size and amenities of the room, the staff, the location in a green park in the center of Singapore.  Very relaxing yet convenient to my office. I go to Singapore several times a year.  I will return here.",5
Solemnization & Stay @ HFC,jinsen,"Solemnization went smoothly in general, with minor hiccups that were resolved pretty easily  Stay was pleasant, and breakfast is good. Room service was prompt and staff were friendly and well informed of guest details between the different departments of the service team.",5
Conference at HFC,Maro Mendez,"The spacious grounds of Hotel Fort Canning sets it apart from the other luxury hotels in Singapore. It somehow reminded me of a plantation mansion. The room I got, was awesome. The bathroom overlooks the lush and green garden. There is a separate bath tub and shower area, which gives the guest an option to enjoy a relaxing bath or a quick shower with a view. The Hotel Staff were helpful. The buffet breakfast and lunch exhibited Singaporean food choices. It is just a long trek to the mrt station -- and taxi would be the most convenient mode of transport for hotel guests.",4
Horrible housekeeping,AliciaWan,"Service from front desk was smooth and good. Bellman service was also very good. Kudos to the indian gentleman for his help! Thank you. However, housekeeping needs to improve tremendously. 1. Our room was not cleaned properly. Floors were greasy and dusty. Cabana at the patio was filthy. 2. Noise at the common corridors made by housekeepers laughing and joking about when we were asleep. 3. We turned on the""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign and yet we were disturbed via the telephone numerous times by housekeeping to CLEAN our room. Come on, seriously? This is the first hotel who had such lazy housekeeping service. Why can't they wait until the guests leave the room and then clean the room?   Regretted choosing this place.",2
Cozy and comfy,Slaw66,"After a hectic week, a staycation was in order and we chose this Hotel for a pampering stay. The room came with a luxurious spacious bathroom, twin beds, lush flora and fauna view, breakfast and one hour evening drinks and snacks for 2. We ate at The Salon, the only restaurant in the hotel, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Quality and service were excellent. We will come back again for sure.",4
beautiful heritage property,Abdul Qader J,"Stayed here for 4 nights at end of Jan 2017 with my daughter. Lovely hotel with beautiful architecture and of course the Fort Canning park. the room was elegant and so was the bath room. service was not consistent, not much attention to what has been consumed. beds were comfortable and the wifi was so so. we tried to order from the room service once, but the choices were very limited especially after 11:00 PM. the hotel is very quiet in general apart from times when the chinese new year was celebrated down stairs. Taxi easy to get from and to the hotel. it is a ten minutes walk to busy parts near Dhoby Ghaut. very friendly staff and helpful. ""Ruby"" at the bar was quite helpful. it was my daughter's birthday, so the hotel surprised us with a cake and a birthday card, a very…",4
A Calm Oasis,John D,Staying here for the second time in two years and little has changed. You are given a very personal check in and as this was our second visit were given an upgrade with a garden view. The rooms are very comfortable with great beds and bathrooms the only down side being lack of power sockets and no only one hard chair. Breakfast is very varied and pleasant without the crowds of some Singapore hotels. There are two swimming pools with plenty of towels available and a dial up bar service for drinks or snacks. You are way up above the hustle and bustle but only a short distance to reach the action. There is direct access to Canning Park and walking to either Orchard Road or  Clarke Quay is very possible. ,4
"Would have given ""Very Good"" ... but ...",arietraveller,"The overall ambience of the hotel is great. The staff were very friendly and approachable. The spacious bathroom which has a wonderful view and the bathtub is a plus point. Another plus factor is the swimming pool. It has a children family pool and also a lap pool. However, when I book the room, the picture of the room show a small table and a chair. When I checked in and entered the room, I was disappointed that the were no table and chair as shown in the picture.",3
5 star building with 3 star service,TOldBar,"We stayed here on our honeymoon recently (the last hotel we stayed at out of 3) and I was pretty glad to see the back of it. For a 5 star hotel it doesn't hold a candle to some of the others in Singapore.  THE GOOD It is located on the very picturesque Fort Canning Park and located close to the interchange MRT Station Dhoby Gaut. The room was nicely appointed with a bathtub (small by Western standards), rain shower head as well as hand held shower head, universal power points, comfortable bed and new TV (though limited English viewing). There are 2 pools (not life guarded). One is very shallow and the deep. There's also a kids size pool next to the shallow one.

This is a review for their event/wedding hosting services,Stajin,"As mentioned above this review is strictly regarding hosting events/ weddings at this hotel. Aboslutely atrocious.  Food: Shark fin soup was nothing but a gelatinous jello. What soup? like eating jello.  Cereal praws were not fresh, they are frozen prawns reheated.  Abalone with spinach - served cold/warm, fake abalone of course so rubbery texture Garoupa fish - so small! unable to feed a table for 12!  Herbal chicken - the chicken was smached into pieces, it was more like a herbal stringy chicken soup. Over powering smell and flavor of herbs.  Rice - cold, sticky.

Lovely hotel in the peaceful green heart of Singapore,Yelseltsew,"This is a lovely hotel in the old British High Command in the centre of Fort Canning.  As befits a heritage building it has old world charm, and yet it is one of the most technologically savvy hotels we have stayed in.  All lights and blinds are on a centralised consol.  You are offered a small phone to take out with you - free internet, calls and GPS, very much appreciated.  The bathrooms are lovely and as they are on the old verandahs of the building, offer views as you undertake your ablutions.  We had a lovely stay.",5

Great Spot,Startofliving,"It was my first time in Fort Cunning, knowing some other spots in SGP. This is a really good and professional place for having company seminars. The glass house offers good possibilities what ever is needed to run a successful training/workshop. The rooms and the breakfast are on the top and help to start the day relaxed and concentrated. I will come again. In addition it was no problem to store parts of my luggage for another day - no discussion - I appreciated this service a lot. ",5

Wedding Banquet,KarinaMonteiro77,"Wedding lunch on 12 Feb today. The Service Staff was not experienced and not proactive. Did not change plates, did not clear soup bowl until prompted. The plates and teacup was dirty with stain at start of banquet.  Perhaps they had lack of manpower and trained staff but what was really upsetting and prompted this review was that they had a dessert buffet but the staff unveiled it( took out food covers etc) already during the 4th dish and some people went to eat it. Since it is a wedding and joyous occasion, I guess it was fine to eat before the 8th dish. But there were no cutlery on buffet line at all and no teaspoon for the shot glass tiramisu and other dessert cakes. I saw some people using chopsticks to eat the dessert and I felt the need to ask for proper cutlery which is…",1
Incredible Stay,gengens,"We stayed at HFC for the last night of our honeymoon and we're so sad it was just the one night stay! The hotel is fantastic and the staff cannot do enough for you. We got such a warm welcome on arrival, it was lovely. The rooms are just beautiful and very well appointed and the pool is one of the most beautiful I've seen. The location is great and so peaceful yet still within easy walking to so many of Singapore's attractions. The only let down for this hotel is the restaurant but there are plenty of other choices nearby so don't let that stop you from staying here! ",5

Not particularly special either but a perfectly decent hotel for a night's stay in Singapore. Would recommend.",5
Staycay with hubby,Shahira S,"This is another hotel in Singapore that I really enjoyed. It is very romantic for me. The bathroom can be seen from a see through glass panels, but if you want more privacy you can roll The blinds downs. I love the bathroom concept and i literally Soak myself in the bathtub for hours, enjoying music from Spotify and relax. Drank a cup of tea and enjoy the scenery through the glass panels. Even the Swimming pool is not crowded. I would love to try the other room with the open veranda next time! 😍",5
Unforgettable!,Toura H,"We stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning for two nights on our way to New Zeeland. Two unforgettable days. Everything was great. The breakfast buffet offers whatever you can wish, english full breakfast, Singapore special dishes, french cheeses, fruits and berries of all kinds and so on. The service is very good without beting too much. There are two big swimmingpools, one is perfect for excercising. We did 45 min of swimming every morning. A great way of preparing yourself for a hearty breakfast. There is also a large and very well equipped gym. The front desk is very helpful.

not 5-Star,jgm99,"When plans fell through for a trip to Indonesia, we decided to stay in Singapore a few more days and try a different hotel after staying at the Marina Mandarin. The contrast couldn't have been more obvious. When you're spending $300+ a night for a five-star hotel you expect a pretty good level of service. Besides being quite noisy at night time, the little things that nice hotels normally get right, Hotel Fort Canning doesn't. Laundry wasn't ready when it was meant to be, there was no stationery or bathrobes in the room, all you get for the coffee machine was two tiny capsules of milk per day. The garden room we stayed in was ok, as long as you don't need privacy when going to the toilet or in your ""private garden"".   The food here is good and decent value for a hotel - we tried…",2

In the end i still prefer to stay in the premium room but i fully appreciate the kind, welcoming gesture from the staff, 2 thumbs up...

Nice hotel at Fort Canning Park,Suria_Nataadmadja,I love the location of this hotel. This hotel surrounded by man made forest and located on a hill.

Good service and free parking is provided for hotel guests. ,5
A special ambience,Gail W,"We selected Hotel Fort Canning because it had historical architecture like Raffles hotel, but was more affordable.  We were so pleased we booked here.  The former army barracks has been beautifuly restored and renovated.  It is located within a park and consequently has a very relaxed and peaceful feel, yet is within easy walking distance of Clarke Quay and other notable sites. The service was excellent as well. Food in the restaurant was good and the gym and pool were great.  We will definitely return to this hotel when we visit Singapore again.",5

The staff were very accommodating, attentive and helpful. We loved the 2 mineral swimming pools. Breakfast was good and catered for a variety of cultures. The park setting with the hotel on top of a hill means that if you want to walk to surrounding roads there are a quite a few stairs but they are manageable.

Good but musty smell,Andy R,Have stayed at this hotel before. Service was as good as always and they even delivered my partner a birthday cake to the room.

There were two main reasons; the 'small details' were not to the standard you expect from a 5 star hotel, and the service was not good.  The 'small details' that we felt missing were: - room layout: e.g power outlets were few and inconveniently placed, the control panel for the lights was difficult to use - missing ingredients and items on the menu that could not be served - breakfast was mediocre, with poor choice for a hotel of that level  The service was not good, and in particular this came to show through one incident: My wife got locked in the…",2
Quiet Luxury,loveyoubaby,"A magnificent residence with old world charm. Check in was seamless and the room was graciously styled. The hotel, for the most part, was very quiet even though it was fully booked. The service from the wait staff in the lounge, restaurant and front desk were exceptional.  My only complaint were the rude and entitled children allowed to run and scream down the halls, throughout the lobby and into the lounge. Although this is mostly a parental issue and not the fault of the hotel, perhaps it is necessary to post reminders that children should be supervised at all times. ",4
Classy staycation on New Years Eve,JamWadia,"This a charming and classic hotel that is located in the midst of a historic place in Singapore, surrounded by lush greenery. The best part about its location is that you are away from the noise and buzz of the city, but just a 10 minute walk will get you bang into the heart of the shopping and business district. The rooms have a nice colonial feel with tall ceilings and big size bathrooms. Rooms facing away from the lobby entrance have an open concept balcony style bathroom, whereas rooms on the opposite side have more private bathrooms on the side of the room. Which layout is better is a matter of your individual preference. The service and check in staff are friendly and courteous and will make you feel welcomed. I do however feel that our room was not properly cleaned up…",4
Nice quiet location.,canberratravels,"Stayed for a week over the Christmas/New Year. Generally ok but probably won't stay here again.  Pros: Quiet location in the middle of a beautiful park. 10 minute walk to MRT. Very friendly, attentive wait staff at breakfast.   Cons: Mobile phone for guest use, including international calls.  Only problem was phone didn't charge properly despite reporting problem to reception. Nice idea though.  Bathroom needs to be given a good scrub to get rid of mould in shower recess.  Not at all interested in giving us more than 1 hour late check out. ",3
Great boutique hotel for romantic getaways,Peter G,"We spent a week-end at HFC, celebrating my wife's birthday. I'd like to thank the staff of the hotel and especially Ms Maggie Chow, helping me to make this week-end memorable. They did their utmost arranging everything I requested in advance and also added little extras here and there.  The hotel is in a fantastic setting, a forest-like environment in the middle of Singapore. Clark quay, Marina Bay, the Chijmes, the east-side of Orchard road are all just few hundred meters away. Or you can just take a nice, romantic walk in the Fort Canning Park.  The hotel is an 86 room boutique hotel, not very busy, not very loud normally - unless there's a wedding. The rooms aren't huge but the design is quite special with the bathtub next to the bed for example. There are 6 rooms downstairs…",5
Historical Hotel,Robert L,"We have stayed several times at this hotel and there is not much to complain over. The breakfast could be more extensive for this class of hotel but it is ok. We are used to walk to were ever we want to go and this hotel is not close to anything really but on the other hand there is a very beautiful park to walk throug, otherwise you are taking a taxi. The service is 5 star and there is a feel of old english class.",4
Excellent services from the historical boutique hotel,705ngm,"Good :  - Walking distance to the Dhoby Ghaut. - Touch panel room control  - Luxury  - Breakfast  - Services   Not good: - Wifi connect - No HDMI switch in the TV remote control  - Room is always in humid, feel the bed is not all dry",4
Not my best experience,thefabfeb,"I went there with my spouse during zica period. Short say, they told me to pay for mosquito repellent instead of providing it free due to the endemic and considering its a 5 stars hotel its a bit cheap reaction. Too bad, because the hotel location is actually great and the history lies behind is intriguing. I would say the bathroom is the actual luxury area compare to the room. Unluckily, i stayed over the weekend when they had a wedding, so it was so noisy in the corridor.",3
5 star in everything but wifi,Teri S,"This is a beautiful hotel on the Fort Canning Hill.  A luxury hotel that has it all (well almost). We were made welcome, despite out quite late arrival, provided with excellent support in understanding the technology in the room (electronics blinds, lights etc), thick cotton sheets and a mattress that was firm but giving.  The buffet breakfast was brilliant and the bar does great cocktails.  The two swimming pools were warm and inviting.  My only quibble is that the wifi seemed particularly slow and given the attention to detail in all other aspects of the hotel I found this surprising.  However, despite this, you should stay here at least once in your life.  It's a classic.",4
"Great room and service, good breakfast and tranquil location",Joseph,"The Deluxe Garden room is very nicely done up, and the bathtub in the room is an interesting touch. Ample space to walk around, especially if you also consider the garden space. Minor downsides are the ventilation - the dampness in the shower area lingered slightly longer than usual, and the space at the toilet bowl - slightly cramped unless you don't mind doing your business in full view of your partner.  Service was impeccable, we were attended to by Ivena who was very courteous and professional. There were two weddings being held the night we checked in, she advised us in advance that there may be slightly more noise audible within the room. To compensate, we got a later checkout at 3pm.   The Apertif hour was decent, with three wines and some canapes. Breakfast was good  -…",4
Colonial grace with modern charm,TomSonntag,"We spent 3 wonderful days at the Hotel Fort Canning. The hotel is an architectural beauty. Its prominent position on a hill affords beautiful views of the city and borders a park with many historic sites. The hotel is about 10 minutes from the MRT. We arrived early after a long flight from New York and were assigned a room in the third floor with city views. The veranda balcony was transformed into a modern marble bathroom with exciting views. The bed and the pillows are very comfortable. The room is very clean. Service is excellent. Two large pools invite guests to spend time in a tropical setting. Whil the hotel and service are excellent, there were minor issues that did not earn the hotel a 5 star rating. First, the water in the shower was cold. We did have hot water in the…",4
Quiet and peaceful refuge,Baskingshark8,"If you like peace and quiet in lush, green surroundings with a touch of history thrown in, then you will love this hotel. We wanted a low rise hotel with the ambience of spacious, colonial type rooms, rather than a glitzy multi storey affair and we were certainly very happy with our choice. After staying 7 nights, I have only positive comments to make about this hotel and the staff who work there. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with warmth and courtesy by all staff and made to feel most welcome. Our premier room which overlooked the park was clean and spacious, a quiet oasis in a bustling city. There was a certain ambience to it, brought about by the greenery, the warm woodwork and the historic feel to the room. The bathroom was huge and spotlessly clean with a…",5
A lovely retreat in the heart of the city,zbiggys,"I really enjoyed this hotel. The staff were friendly and very informative. The buffet breakfast didn't have the largest selection, but the selection they had was tasty and plentiful.  I found the room was much more spacious than at other hotels I've stayed in. The rooms were light filled thanks to huge windows. The bathroom was large enough to have a few couples dance in if you wanted to. The retreat area was another delightful aspect of the room with a super comfortable swivel chair, a dream to sit in and read.  The hotel is located within the Fort Canning park, which means that in the heart of the city you are surrounded by lush greenery. It's within a short walking distance to the MRT and from there the connection to everything Singapore is simple.  The one thing that let…",4
Could have been much better!,Patricia N,"We had a one night stay at Hotel Fort Canning over the weekend, we stayed in the suite room which was set in the lush greenery; gorgeous and spacious.   However, the service and experience was nothing to shout about.   First off, check in was late despite letting the hotel know in advance that we were celebrating an important occasion. That is still okay as they might be really running on a high house count. We only got the room past 3pm but it was perfect so no complaints. The only issue was when we requested for a late check out the following day, we had some difficulty in getting that approved. We had a huge bit of stuff to pack up from the night before and would prefer not to leave the room in a mess. The first reaction I got from the front desk staff was: There is a guest…",3
A true disapointment!,WTraveller9,"It could and should be a wonderful place to stay with a lovely atmosphere but it's NOT! Be informed that this 5* Boutique hotel doesn't provide any mosquito repellent in the room and if you ask for it, the hotel will charge you. As we were not so pleased we this, we asked for the Front office manager. A lady came to us but literally ignored my wife. No greeting to her, now eyes contact, nothing till i introduce my wife. This lady explained us that they do regular fogging around the hotel. So i ask if they guarantee a mosquito-free inside the hotel. The answer was ""no, we cannot"". We went to Singapore during the Zirka period, so we were a bit concerned with that issue. Nevertheless, Housekeeping finally brought us a mosquito repellent for free. We appreciated this gesture…",3
A hidden gem,AAmbrose,"This has got to be THE best hotel I've stayed in Spore. From its lush green surroundings to its tasteful interiors in a heritage building and its ever helpful staff, HFC truly exceeded my expectations. The rooms are bigger than most in Spore. The bathrooms spacious and very tastefully done. The guest service staff at the front of the house was excellent. Throughout our stay, each and every single one of them went out of their way to make our stay at the hotel and in Spore as pleasurable as possible.",5
Beautiful Hotel Let Down By Bad Service,Tony Sung,"Hotel Fort Canning is like a badly cut gem.  It is truly a gem, located in the midst of a park atmosphere of Fort Canning at the end of Orchard Road. Just 10 minutes out of the hustle bustle of the shopping paradise of Singapore, you get this unbelievable old colonial style bungalow hotel surrounded by a park. You won't even feel you are in a city but in some remote resort.  The staff at the check in desk were excellent, scoring 10 out of 10. The room was interesting and would appeal to some with the bathroom located in the balcony overlooking the city skyline.  Food at the restaurant ""The Saloon"" was not bad but the service was atrocious. Was in a group of 16 and we had set dinner for everyone. Still the staff looked overwhelming trying to serve a large group. We wanted bread…",2
Wonderful Hotel in a beautiful setting,Sheldon5150,The Hotel Fort Canning is a beautifully restored fort in a central location in Singapore.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed.  The automatic full blackout blinds were much appreciated while trying to overcome some jet lag.  The grounds are magnificent with historic sites and gardens all on the hill.  The staff were very accommodating. I clicked mid price but its really luxury features for a mid priced hotel. I can't say enough good things about the whole experience.,5
Great Boutique Historical Hotel,Valentine B,"The room are great, service is very arranging, and nice atmosphere in general. Good bar listing with Piper-Heidsieck by the glass, nice view on the greeneries. I would really recommend this place. A downtown, smaller version of Capella Hotel, and a better service !",5
Tranquil oasis,Susan B,"Beautiful hotel,a world away from the hubbub of orchard road but only 2 stops away on the MRT.Rooms aren't large but a mix of old world charm and modern technology.Free happy hour was a nice surprise and very enjoyable.Two huge pools shallow at one end for children and a large pool for serious swimmers.The staff 11 out of 10 very helpful and friendly.Breakfastwas$25 very good with plenty of choices with local and western cuisine..A short walk to Dhoby Ghaut station when your ready to explore,Fort canning park is huge 7 acres right outside the hotel,A great place stay",5
Great Hotel,Dayle A,We enjoyed this hotel very much.  It was the former British Far East Headquarters during WWII.  It has been beautifully renovated.  It is situated in the Park overlooking Singapore.  We walked downtown as Clarke Quay is fairly close.   Just walking through the park is very historical!  Beds are very comfortable.  Happy hour every evening with wine and horderves.,5
Excelent place to stay,maccine2016,"Rooms were a good size, Bathroom as well. Bed was a bit too hard for my liking. Set in a parkland there is no traffic noise. 10 minute walk to Orchard road and other facilities. The 2 for one deal in the bar helps ease the pain if you like a beer or two. The staff provide excellent service with a special mention to Abigail, Erica and Ruby. The hotel staff made our stay feel so much more welcome. it was our 30th wedding anniversary and the room presentation was a pleasant surprise, it was a very nice touch. This place is also wedding central, I was actually surprised by the amount of couples. Over all this is a good place to stay.",5
An Oasis In The Heart Of Singapore,,"One of my favourite parts of any hotel stay is learning about the history and culture, which is a central part of Hotel Fort Canning. This is made clear as soon as you arrive at the hotel, because there are 4 glass covered underground dig sites showing artefacts that were found in the surrounding area. The hotel also offers various walking trails around the Fort Canning Park explaining some of the interesting history along the way!  Fort Canning Park is one of the central parts that makes Hotel Fort Canning so unique. The Park is the highest natural elevation point in southern Singapore you can get some great sunset photos from one of the many vantage points in the hotel. It is also within walking district to the vibrant Downtown Core, so you will have easy access to shopping…",5
Hotel Fort Canning,Janette M,Very nice rooms fantastic staff especially Abigail and our two special girls Erica and Ruby who made us feel at home. We would definitely stay here again. Beautiful scenery as the hotel is in the middle of a park. Janette and Neil McAskill ,5
Average Hotel in a Quaint Location,ishitasinghal88,"Stayed at the Fort Canning for a night and the rooms are just as in the pictures. Interiors are plush & the bathroom is also done well with a garden view from each bathroom. The hotel is atop the hill amidst the Fort Canning park so it's not on the main road & hence offers a nice serene experience. Their staff was very polite and always helping with the minutest of details.   However, for a 4/4.5 star hotel & the price they charged me for the night, I thought the hotel was over-rated as the room was very small (even by the Singapore standards), the breakfast buffet was dull and had only a couple of options. I do not eat meat and the only thing I could eat for breakfast was fruits and hash browns. Even these were not done well and the fruits seemed like they had been lying there…",3
Garden View Room,Amit G,"Room was clean, modern with a luxurious bathroom and a very comfortable King bed.  Staff was very friendly.  Location is very peaceful as it's located in the midst of a park.  However the hotel is 5-10 minutes away from everything.  Uber is the best way to get around, although taxis aren't too bad either.",4
Beautiful colonial hotel well past its hay day,MISG,"Great for a wedding venue, two in the three nights I stayed, not great if you don't enjoy the wedding guests taking over the hotel day and night.   Restaurant is poor, pizza and burgers.   Location is good being in the park yet close to Orchard Road.   Two decent enough pools.   Not sure who they are targeting there are better options for families, business, tourists on offer in this price range",3

Central relaxing and quiet,Mandn157,My partner and I stayed at the hotel after a cruise for 5 days. We were attracted by the location and that the hotel was small in comparison to other hotels we were looking at. the pools were the best pools I have ever swam in. They were clear and refreshing and most of the time I was the only one in them. We stayed from Tuesday to Saturday and were well looked after by the staff. The Hotel was much busier leading up to the weekends due to the weeding industry. The registers office is just down the hill.   The hotel was walking distance to all the great shopping Singapore has to offer and we usually walked down the hill and taxi back to the hotel. The park is great and i used this daily for walking and running. Just a note run early in the morning or after the sun goes down as…,5
Great hotel - paper thin walls,L L,"We love Singapore and regularly travel from Aus for quick relaxing getaways.  This time we wanted to spend a little more on accomodation and chose Hotel Fort Canning. Great rooms, beautiful setting in the park, excellent pools - and complimentary drinks between 1800 - 1900. All perfect except the first morning we were woken up at 0500 by the noisiest television next door. It didn't stop. Unsure whether our room had the ability to become an adjoining room I don't know, but when you can theoretically inform the Americans in the next room about whether it's worth going to the river safari because you CAN HEAR EVERYTHING they're saying its pretty frustrating and incredibly annoying.

"Great stay, great service",QuansterDallas,"We spent one week in Singapore and stayed at Fort Canning. Beautiful rooms, spacious, and full of light. Breakfast was included and they had a good variety of food. Service was exceptional. One caveat:  the hotel is up on a hill, and there is no good way of getting public transportation.  You have to walk down the winding hill or take a bunch of stairs, then walk to the nearest metro. Since it is located inside the park,  you also cannot just walk out for a cup of coffee or shopping. Taxis are everywhere and relatively cheap, so if you don't want to walk, and you are ok waiting for one,  it's reasonable to use taxis.",5
Amazing lush green garden hotel  on hill top ,lsg181,"Amazing hotel surrounds by huge green garden, it looks even more enchanting on little hill top in the mid of city centre. Cafe offers good value high tea set $25/pax or simply chill out with wine or draft beer at 1-for-1. ",5

Excellent hotel for discovering Singapore,bighead,"My wife and I stayed here en route to New Zealand and weren't disappointed by the hotel. The room, looking towards the city over the front garden, was really well appointed, with a huge, comfortable bed and a luxury bathroom. The restaurant served us a lovely meal: sweet and sour pork-yummy. There's a wide range of options for breakfast. The complementary wine in the evening is a really nice touch. The staff were all very helpful. The location, in the park, means that the hotel is an oasis of peace within a bustling city. Highly  recommended!",5
Beautiful Hotel with Accessible Location,Hendry,"My room was beautiful with a very nice view, the receptionist was very helpful but could be warmer, however I do feel that during my stay, the Hotel was short of staff.

Great customer service,Syahidah A,"Friendly man upon check in. Unfortunately I forgot his name. As it was our first time, he guide us to the room and even showed us around.

This hotel is located at Fort Canning Park which offer a green view. It is a nice place to jog and relax.   Nearest MRT station is Dhoby Ghaut with just a walking distance from this hotel. This station is an interchange station connect 3 MRT lines. It is very convenient for tourists.  ,5
Good staycation experience,Joe E,"HFC is a great place to unwind in the middle of the city.  When we were there, there was a wedding function so the hotel was busy.  Service was great and the staff very very friendly.  Breakfast was ok while room service option was as expected, normal.  It is best to book through one of the websites hotel.com or booking.com as the nornal rates at HFC can be pricey especially on weekends.  I would recoemmend to tourists who are in Singapore for the first time.",4
Perfect stay!,karkiat,"We enjoyed the interaction with each and every staff, from the front desk, housekeeping, maintenence to room service folks.

This hotel is a gem!,PatrickP,"You could choose to stay in one of the usual bland over priced chain hotels in Singapore. You'd be surrounded by concrete and probably paying over the odds to do so. Not with the Fort Canning Hotel.   For a start it is located in the Fort Canning park, which means that your outlook wont be the officeblock next door, it'll be green tranquil trees and you'll be ablr to take in in Fort Canning park, which is serene and lovelly.   The hotel itself is a gorgeous building origially buiilt to house the Singapore military. It was taken over by the Japanese when they invaded, but is now a pretty tastefully designed hotel.

Away from the maddening crowd,SiamWanderer,"This is where you will find peace and harmony. The rooms are spacious and very well decorated. Service is incredible as they spoil your every need.

Peace and quiet amongst city life,Nadia P,"My partner and I stayed at HFC for six days (for F1) and it was just a completely relaxing and beautiful hotel. To start the hotel is surrounded by park land (is hilly in some areas) that blocks out noise of nearby traffic, it also has quiet a lot of war history which I recommend future travellers to look at.  Getting to the hotel from the airport I would suggest a taxi or uber (only $25 AUD) as walking from Dhouby Gaut is all up hill on the way back from the MRT.  Checking in is very personal as you sit with the staff rather than stand behind a desk. The staff were friendly and professional offering us maps etc and notifying us of things to do.

Add to this a wonderfully comfortable bed and an assortment of different pillows, and guests can have the most restful of sleeps.  The hotel staff are extremely friendly and helpful,  and upon request, a variety of pillows were sent to our room for testing, until we found the right ones!  By Singapore standards, the rooms are fairly big, except for the bathtub which takes up a lot of space - who thought a bathtub in a tropical country was a good idea?!

The hotel is located in one of Singapore's historic parks so is quieter than other hotels I have stayed in in Singapore. It is also 5-7 minute walk away from the Doby Ghaut MRT station and Orchard road. It is a very centrally located hotel with easy MRT access.

Bathroom looking into city view great and not overlooked. We had deluxe room city view. In my opinion better as premier looking into hill.

Not up to standard for a 5 star hotel ,Claudia M,"The garden rooms' patio were not well maintained/not very clean, one of the towels had two black marks on them, the tv channel selection is also quite limited. Most of the staff were really friendly and helpful, except for one! ",3
Staycation,baicow,"Decided to give HFC a shot after a friend suggested to me this hotel. The room was beautiful and I had a lovely 2 night staycation there. Minor issue was with the phone in the room, as I couldn't for the life of me get it to work, so I had to rely on using the one in the toilet to make calls (and funny enough, order IRD). Other than that everything was great, and the room service food was presented really nicely as well. ",4
Center city but still a get-away,shimt0,"I got to stay for a few days during my business trip. It is on the top of a hill and there is nothing in walking distance so you'd need a vehicle. Taxis task a while to come by.  The hotel itself is beautiful in a unique colonial structure. The breakfast is nice but serving exactly the same selections daily, I would have wished more variations in the hotel of this caliber. ",4
A great choice!,JonathanSymonds,"We greatly enjoyed our two-night stay here, as the hotel is central but set within a park, with pleasant walks.  We received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe suite, the rooms of which were very modern and comfortable. All staff were courteous and friendly, and we enjoyed complimentary evening drinks and canapés, and a tasty dinner in their restaurant. Breakfast is also generous and the choice good, and attractively laid-out in the restaurant.",5
Truly a five star experience in this historic hotel,nevanlalich,"We booked this hotel after a long 3.5 weeks touring South East Asia and we had previously been to Singapore and was looking for somewhere unique to stay whilst maintaining a non boutique feel. This hotel delivered on all fronts. Stunning luxurious rooms, friendly staff, complimentary evening drinks and canapés and spacious bath in the room. When we arrived the wifi in our room was not working which was frustrating and i spoke to the front desk and they arranged for a new router to boost or fix the issue and was resolved in 15mins. Also having a Nespresso in the room was fantastic, as it made it feel more like home.  We ate at the Salon for breakfast and given the quality of the food we decided to give the 4 course dinner offer a go. On paper it didn't look overly enticing but we…",5
"Aggressive and Inhuman ""reservation"" sales dept. of this hotel",Virginia L,"I did not stay in this hotel and gotta cancel my 3 days 2 nights biz trip to Singapore due to the Zika virus outbreak since Sun, it is especially inappropriate for women to travel there who are planning about pregnancy. The hotel did not accept my late cancellation or reschedule at no extra cost (Indeed, I requested to cancel my booking on the following working day i.e. Monday, after the news report about this virus outbreak on Sunday) and I was told I will be charged one night SGD252 according to my booking record for this late cancellation. After I expressed my disappointment in email to the Hotel Reservation Manager directly, I was offered a kind of ""option"" if by the same day, I can accept and pay SGD188.32 immediately as an additional non refundable amendment charge and I…",1
Historic Stay,Wayne S,"This is a wonderful place to stay in Singapore, although not a cheap one. If you don't mind paying a little extra for excellent facilities and service, this is a great choice. We chose it for a number of reasons, chief of which were its setting in a park and its low-rise setting (3 floors only). It was, during WW2, the headquarters for the British Far East command, and has had several uses since, including laying idle for a number of years. Only a few years ago it was converted to this quite luxurious hotel, with lovely dining, chemical free pools and a lovely bonus of complimentary canapés and drinks for guests in a private lounge every night from 6-7 pm. Orchard Road shopping precinct and the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station are a few minutes walk away...downhill on the way and uphill…",5
Great but don't drink the hotel water,jem_s364,"Myself and my two year old daughter had a reasonably pleasant stay here in July. The staff were excellent and managed to get us into our room early which was very much appreciated with an exhausted toddler. We had an unfortunate experience with the bottled hotel water. After a long nights sleep we both drank some of the water and we were both immediately sick. There was definitely something wrong with it. I have travelled extensively through Asia and never had an issue with hotel water.  I informed the staff but I definitely got the impression they didn't believe me. The other strange thing is that there were no changing rooms by the pool. This was a little annoying as I didn't want to walk through the hotel in my bathing suit! Apart from that , a pleasant stay and the staff…",3
A Great Place to Stay,JMF_7,"Hotel Fort Canning is a great place to stay in Singapore. The swimming pool is fabulous! The rooms are spacious and clean, although it can be 3pm in the afternoon before your room is serviced. However the cleaners offer a first class service and are so polite and very helpful. Breakfast has something for everyone, eggs cooked to order, British and American fayre as well as local cuisine, it's fab. At 6pm complimentary wine , fruit juice and appetisers are available free of charge. The hotel weren't able to offer a late checkout but did permit us to shower in the spa area before our long flight home. This hotel was an absolute pleasure to stay in with polite, courteous staff. I really couldn't fault it and would definitely staff again.",4
Boutique Luxury,danta83,This hotel is a gem with great character. Rooms are beautiful with excellent working area desk and luxury bathroom. Choice of two lovely swimming pools. It is discreetly located in a park for nice scenic walks and peaceful from the city area but very close walk or taxi to the main Singapore areas. For a 5* in SINGAPORE this was fantastic value for money.,5
Cherry on top after a 3 week vacation,Andrew B,"What a beautiful oasis after 3 weeks gallavanting around Europe.

Luxurious stay and fantastic service,Hyugo H,We stayed as a couple as a stop over after a long trip in Europe. Very spacious hotel and luxurious - amenities and rooms.  Special thanks to Vanesh for being so helpful and attentive. He made our stay amazing. We will definitely stay here again. ,5
So comfortable,Dan M,"There is a lot to like about this hotel - it only has 86 rooms, the rooms are spacious, the shower and bath just wash away the day's humidity, free wifi and the staff are very friendly. The location is good with an RMT nearby.",5
"Good stay, pretty room",Syingting,"Very good stay overall.  The room was a pretty deluxe room, high ceiling & bathroom was a spacious and pretty one with a spacious bathtub.   Check in time was 2pm. I arrived later, about 3pm. The hotel staff was friendly, but also, they told me to wait 10-15mins for the room to be ""thoroughly ready"", they said the room is already cleaned, but need to be checked once more. After 15mins, it still wasn't done. I finally got to my room only at about 4-4.15pm. The hotel staff was nice to bring us to the room.   The hotel was very kind to present me with birthday cake and birthday wishes. It was a really sweet gesture.   Check out process was rather smooth.   Thank you Hotel Fort Canning for the great stay, it could've been wonderful if the check in did not take so long. ",5
Wonderful   Will Return.,ca920,"We had a wonderful stay, and we will be back in the future. The hotel was very nice and quiet, hidden away in the wood of Fort Canning Park which made it even more special. We loved the history of Singapore that this part of town could offer to us.   Also, want to pass on a thank you for the special birthday cake for my Mum, and the specially prepared card from the staff. . It really touched my mum and made her 70th birthday memorable.   Personal highlights of the stay would include but not limited to, the personal pillow selection, the morning newspaper selection, long and exploring walks at Fort Canning Park, the adjacent Battle Box tour, the morning yoga class , and last but not least the smiley and welcoming staff interactions I had all around the hotel.  The location is…",5
NO FLAWS AT ALL,Vittocci,Beautiful Hotel surrounded by green. Well connected. 10 minute walk to the river. Luxurious rooms and nice staff. Pool is great too. Strongly recommended since it might result cheap compared to the same high level hotels. I like the idea you are inside a green park where air is much better and you can also go jogging.,5
Hotel is beautiful and in lush surrounding,colby101105,"The rooms are clean and the hotel is beautiful. I would definitely stay here on Holiday. Steps away from Metro and only a few blocks away from tourist sights. My only suggestion would be to improve the Staff service at the hotel restaurant. A bit slow and had items delivered to our table that we didn't order.  BUT ..... The front desk staff went above and beyond when my check out time was very early in the morning.  They had  breakfast prepared, boxed and ready for me.  And the  front desk Manger was there to wish me a pleasant trip home.   ",5
Great stay!,Yodayod,"Perfect for couples who seeks a quieter place to stay! Hotel staffs were helpful, the room was nice and clean. Bathroom was awesome with great view thru large windows. MRT station is only a short walk!",5

soundproof,bararctrip,- it will be better if the corridor in front of room are soundproof. currently we can hear people walking and talking there.                  - it would be great it the hotel can borrow the guest an EZ card for local trip without charges. The guest just do the top up.,4
A secret gem,andrewheard,"Tucked away in the charming Fort Canning Park this hotel used to be the British Military headquarters in Singapore before being occupied by the Japanese army and then then the Singapore military HQ.   It is a charming personal hotel that has been very tastefully renovated representing good value for money.   The well restored architecture, boutique nature of this hotel and the surrounding gardens of Fort Canning Park make this hotel special.   Highly recommended ",4
Serenity in the City,Aizat T,"Very close to the city area, however without the hustle and bustle of the city. Could have nice walks around for canning park whilst still be able to have a romantic dinner in robertson quay. Friendly and very helpful staff as well.",5
A Unique Style of Hotels,KLF550,We stayed in HFC for 3 Nights and and we loved the style and the comfort that the Hotel has provided. The Hotel is well situated and the bed and bathroom are high quality material. I definitely would stay in this hotel if I'm going back to Singapore.,5
A quality oasis in the middle of the city,Kemangindo,"Stayed 2 nights in Prem Lux room via a late booking special - large room & very comfortable. The building and friendly staff makes it feel more like a large B&B rather than a city hotel, with an open, green peacful park location, but close to MRT.  Living in Jakarta for +15yrs, we travel frequently to Singapore, and this hotel is now our favourite. Though be aware it is a short climb, up a road & stairs, from the MRT to the hotel.  Also, bathroom lighting not good for shaving & makeup.",5
relaxation in middle of centre,Georg B,"Excellent breakfast , friendly helpful staff suporting great service , wonderful relaxation at pool , peaceful location of hotel in nature .   Cool design of room and bath .  However we had wished the windows had been cleaned. The last room in 2nd floor (corner) did not have the bright glass front to the bath , but small dirty windows 😩 The first room given to us was smelly of moisture (basement / souterrain) and staff was going pass with housekeeping equipment.  When opening the balcony door we found the small wooden pieces of the floor broken.   Staff at reception could be less arrogant - breakfast staff and anybody else excellent !",4
Comfortable bed. Toilet is beautiful.,Looneymouse,"Everything is fine except the toilet doors are hard to close and open. Bed is very comfortable, can sleep 3 persons. Wifi is fast. Toilet is beautiful with bath tub. Overall experience is great. Counter service staff can improve more on their helpfulness though.",4
Beautiful oasis,JNutchey,"We stayed 8 nights in this beautiful hotel. The 3 floor, beautifully renovated building is so different to many other places you can stay in Singapore.  It was immaculately clean, serviced daily (at your preferred time if you state it) & well equipped. Staff were always friendly and helpful.  The gym is extremely well equipped and there is a separate 25m lap pool (in addition to another recreational pool).  Late afternoon canapes and drinks were complimentary in the hotel lobby.  We had a late flight at night and were able you store our bags all day and then utilise their gym/club showers to freshen up before or flight. This hotel is conveniently located between the orchard road and clarke quay precincts. This hotel is at the top of the fort canning park - a beautiful park. Be…",5
Warm hospitality received,selizaaa,"Had a 2 nights staycation with my fiance, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. The open-concept bathtub idea was great - good for soaking in with your partner whilst watching tv. The only grip was the ""special garden"", which we assumed will be exclusive to us, fully intimate. However, public could walk pass the other side of the garden, with minimal planters obstructing their peek into our garden. Plus, the rooms beside ours could look into our garden. It will be awesome if we can have the whole garden to ourselves, with no fear that we will be seen by the public. Other than that, the staffs were nice - we asked for a universal adapter and lots of water bottles during our stay to stay hydrated. ",4
Falling apart it seems,SA Tan,"We stayed for 2 nights on a business trip and we enjoyed the luxury of the hotel.   The hotel is beautiful being within Fort Canning Park. We love our big room and bed! There was a spacious working space with a reading chair which was great for us to get work done comfortably. Our bathroom was huge, we loved it! There was a wall phone attached using double sided tape that fell off the wall (eek!).   The aircon was however too cold for us. We spent our first night with our aircon turned off and it was still quite chilly. On our second night, we got the staff to help control from the front desk and it was slightly warmer but wasn't warm enough for us. But kudos to the staff for being very helpful.   Location: Great if you're ok to get a cab all the time. In Singapore, booking a…",4
Quiet and green,Doya V,"The hotel is in the midst of the park's greenery. We had a ground floor room that opened to a lovely porch with lots of trees giving you a perfect sunshade.

After a long day, it was nice coming home to our tree-covered porch!",4
A green gem,Ann S,"We stayed at Fort Canning Hotel in a deluxe double room on the 2nd floor. A really enjoyable stay. A green gem amidst the lush green of FC Park. Very clean colonial style room. Quiet surroundings. A delectable breakfast buffet with egg station greets you in the morning. The hotel staff were very accomodating and attended to every request. The hotel even offers ""happy hour drinks"" with canapes daily. A nice sophisticated touch.",4
A lovely hotel,Mark C,"We stayed here for 6 nights until 20-7-16. It is a small hotel but all the better for that.  The rooms were very nice and based on my experience of other Singapore hotels, of a good size. Our bed area led to a bathroom the full width of the room. The oddity is that the wall is glass so it brings the light in from the external window. You can either bring down the electric blinds to use the facility....or be proud! The food options were limited but tasty enough and in the main, the service was good. I did complain about the service for our 2nd breakfast, but the hotel reacted magnificently to my complaint - both in dealing with it and putting the issues right. In the evening they offer complimentary wine from 6-7PM in the lobby area - a really nice touch. The location of the…",5
"""Luxury hotel""? Not even close",ehteejaywhy,"Upon checking in, staff at the front desk was mumbling under her breathe throughout, she handed us 2 f&b vouchers which we could not figure out what she was saying. The grooming of her uniform was poor, I could see the food stains on her shirt and the name tag was dangling, facing the floor which means it is impossible to read her name unless I bend down. If this is how HFC staff wears the name tag, what is the purpose of having one?  She led us to our rooms and despite noticing our hands are full of luggage, she did not offer any help. We were awe-d by the room’s scenic view when we entered, as there was abundance of natural sunlight shining in. We were excited to try out the room facilities. However, the smart TV keyboard controller was not responding half the time and we…",1
lovely hotel but NEEDS improvements!,Zetster,"We stayed here for one night last weekend, usually we will stay in orchard road, as it was easy to move about with a toddler.   The hotel is nice, has beautiful greeneries around it. Tastefully decorated.  However, a few things that needs to be addressed, the toilet's shower is leaking, there is no wall to prevent water spilling out. The door to the toilet is also the automatic door, with press to open, so its not great with curious child. He kept pressing on and on. The safe provided was not working, on check out day, we had to call reception to open the safe.   We did order room service and the food was just ok, nothing exceptional. even the room service menu is limited.  As others have mentioned, its quite a distance to walk to orchard.

The fitness centre was also very well equipped.  thoroughly enjoyed the wkend staycation.",4
One of my favorite boutique hotels,Sukee C,"I'm originally from Singapore but live in the US now.  Whenever I visit Singapore, if I'm not staying with family, I'll stay at Hotel Fort Canning.  It's tucked away from the bustle, and I love the quaint colonial decor - high ceilings, plantation shutters etc.  Each room also comes with a full bathtub. In fact the bathroom is one of the best features of the room.  The only negatives is that there isn't really a restaurant or a bar, and it's a small hike to the metro station.  But if you're looking for some quiet time/space, this is the perfect place for you.",5
"Clean, family friendly hotel with colonel design.",Sheena P,"Ambience was quiet and relax for a staycation. Love the rooms with high ceiling. The only missing thing in the room was an alarm clock.

Excellent customer services from the hotel staffs.",5
Wonderful stay,annie h,"This hotel is located in the heart of Singapore but surround by an amazing park. The hotel staff were very welcoming and helpful.

A clean modern hotel with interesting historical links.,Smith1374,"The hotel was very well located with a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road in one direction and a 10 minute walk to Clarke Key in the other. Locted on top of a hill it has a lot of steps to walk up or down if you are always departing on foot - when we found this an issue we would walk to our destination then grab a taxi back. The rooms are clean with very nicely appointed bathrooms. They are quite small bedrooms, accentuated by the very high ceilings. There is not a lot of space for bags etc., but adequate if you emptied them and used the wardrobes, drawers and hanging. The bathroom was spacious, and the deluxe room gave extra space and a desk to work at. The pools were quite nice, but in general the hotel seemed almost empty as there was very few people ever at the pool (generally…",4
Quiet Ambience,Usha s,"The ambience was quiet, and relaxing. Breakfast spread limited, but has the essentials with Asian spread. Due to weather, did not try out the pool. Stayed in garden room, and was felt the whole bathroom/toilet concept puzzling and not practical for families. Bathroom/Toilet doors are translucent and the area within the sleeping area bound to get wet given the small size. Not the best of stay but not disappointing either. The customer service was good though, especially from the personnel that attended to us.",4
A delight,Verity B,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay the room was lovely and the service and amenities were great. There was the choice of two pools, the food was delicious and we enjoyed six o'clock drinks where we met some very interesting people from around the world. We would definitely stay there again.",5
Disappointing room but excellent service,Jav A,"Stayed in their junior suite but was rather disappointed. The bed in the room was not a king size and was literally combined using 2 single beds. My wife and i could feel the gap between the 2 single beds opening up during our sleep. Also, there was no bathrobe provided in the wardrobe and we could not put on immediately after shower.  Was looking forward to their breakfast but there was a power trip/failure resulting in the chef not being able to cook anything for us.   However, the staffs are very helpful and attended well to our needs. But more could be improved for the room based on the points above.",3
Comfortable Staycation,AaronAikWeiJian,"Had a staycation with friends over the weekend in the deluxe room. Was on a lower floor but the view was unique nonetheless. Room size was ideal with a comfortable bed, a sofa as well as a unique bathroom overlooking the city. The entire hotel has a modern and comfortable feel.  The room doors were not very sound proof as I could hear the television/music as I walked along the corridor. Was a little troublesome when I had to use the washroom during my swim because there were no washroom located by the pool and I had to walk back to my room.   Nonetheless, a good stay and will consider coming back.",4
"Beautiful Rooms, Helpful & Accommodating Staff",Liesl T,"My husband and I held our wedding dinner at Hotel Fort Canning and were given a complimentary two-night's stay in their Bridal King Room. The hotel staff was helpful and attentive, and room service was prompt and delicious! The lush greenery surrounding the hotel is a welcome contrast to the urban landscape of Singapore, and its location in the park contributes greatly to the relaxing atmosphere, even though it is actually situated fairly near the busy shopping district. Hotel Fort Canning provides a pleasant and unique accommodation and experience, and my husband and I would love to stay there again.",5
Great Hotel- Very friendly & helpful staff,Sally B,"A good size room, i really like the character of the building too.  The staff were very accommodating, opening the gym for me late in the evening, and making breakfast when the hours had finished.  The only thing i would mention is that as a business traveller and used to staying in hotels, is that it would be good to offer an all night in room dining service. I was on UK time and staying for a night, so by the time i was hungry it was too late for in- room dining and i had to eat peanuts and chocolate from the minibar! It would be good if there was even a small menu available.  But, other than that small thing, the hotel was great.  The pools were also lovely.",5
A great hotel - but not the one for me,Florian W,"I stayed at the HFC for 5 nights in June and I booked the hotel to get something different for a change. I usually stay directly on Orchard Road and I wanted to finally tray something else.  The hotel itself is great. There is nothing bad I could write about it - on the contrary: It is stylistically speaking a very classy hotel. The exquisite taste can be felt throughout the whole hotel and you do not need to know that the furniture is Poltrona Frau. Sitting down for check-in and check-out also was a personal note which was very cool and unusual for me.  But would I stay at the HFC again? No. The location was just too off-putting for me. When living directly on Orchard Road or in Marina, you don't have to walk the distances you have to walk when you just want to go gab a snack.…",3

Beautiful hotel in the park,Alvin N,"I truly enjoyed my stay here. I wish I stayed longer. Service was amazing and they even got me a birthday cake since I stayed there during my birthday but did not specifically inform them of it. It was a nice initiative on the hotel's part. Daily evening refreshments include wines and sparkling wine with finger food. Its location is also very good, being next to Fort Canning Park, which is a nice place to walk around. It's also close enough to the MRT station and bus access. The room was state-of-the-art. Definitely a nice place for a staycation as well. I hope to come back to this hotel some time soon.",5

We had booked breakfast for two mornings but only required it for one as our flights were leaving too early, they would not offer a refund but they did supply breakfast to our room with fruit and pastries.  Toast was also provided but no condiments were supplied, so we didn't eat our cold toast.  We appreciate the effort but it was not good enough for what we paid, this was the only let down.

Fell in Love,velasquezabegail,"We stayed in Singapore for more than a week and Hotel Fort Canning is our 3rd hotel. And boy, we regret not staying there earlier.  It was in the middle of a historical park, in the middle of one of the busiest metropolis in the world. It was a perfect haven.  As we enter the lobby, we already know it was way better than our previous stays and it was so cozy and elegant at the same time.  Our room is on the third floor and it was absolutely great. It was luxurious and comfortable at the same time. The bathroom is such a treat. We also appreciated the speakers since we are a ""musical"" couple. Haha. All the simple touched like the one control for the temperature, lights and curtains are great. We never have to confused about the controls.  The staff is also commendable. I am bad…",5
40th Wedding Anniversary visit,home81,This is a truly wonderful hotel set in a beautiful park but only a short stroll from Orchard road. A mixture of old colonial feel and Singaporean culture is to be found in this hotel. I found the rooms clean and spacious with modern touches to make your stay delightful. Dinning was a bit quirky everything from pizza to filet mignon served in a bright noisy surroundings. This is not a criticism as we found this in most restaurants in Singapore. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive and helpful. I'd have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. ,5
My Hotel stay ! ,xcara,"Hotel staff friendly, Check in and check out was okay, staff seems pretty junior, a quiet hotel, just 2 levels, everything was fine, except bathroom glass was see thru feel privacy was not that good at night,  lastly room service food was cold and stale feel like the leftovers from buffet at salon, which serves exact same food, price a bit over, just a 4 stars not 5 stars.",4
Perfect Staycation,heniheniheni,"It was a birthday present, 2 nights in HFC Deluxe room. Absolutely loving the toilet ! Imagine soaking in a hot bubble bath with a wide view of the sky and drinking your favourite glass of wine. Never thought staycation can be so satisfying. :)  Staffs are all very friendly, even a room attendant will greet you along the corridor.",5
A real vacation,Irene C,"This hotel not only served me a relaxing holiday, but also let me see the history of Signapore.  It was located on the highest point of Singapore and surrounded by many well perserved heritage pieces in green.    Walking around with the tour guide in the morning, to breathe the fresh air, was highly recommended.",5
A wonderful and memorable stay,ngweiqiang83,"It is a good 2 nights stay at Fort Canning Hotel. It will always be a special place for my girlfriend and I as it is where I proposed to her during our stay.   The hotel front desk staffs did a great job in helping with the email queries that I had over the past month, and arrangement on the towel art and decoration.   In terms of the room and services, the hotel is one of the best I ever experience, the place is quiet for couples to have a good time together, the room is cozy with a big bathtub. Overall, it has been value for money and we have enjoyable stay.  Thank you Hotel Fort Canning! :)",5
Hi-Tea Party at The Salon with Family and Friends,Aud,"We recently had a Hi-Tea party at The Salon for 25 pax. While the location was good and food was decent, the service was totally not reflective of the price paid.   We initially booked for 20 pax but had 25 pax attending in the end. When we arrived, the waiters and waitresses did not know how manage the situation. True, there are additional people. A properly trained crew or at least a crew with someone leading should know how to set up the extra tables and chairs to accommodate the additional people. While my guest were trying to fit themselves on the insufficient seating arrangement, the waiters/waitresses just stared on, clueless about what to do.  We had to give them specific instructions on how to set the tables and chairs to fit everyone in. Instead of giving us…",2
Contemporary,L7108UFsamh,We stayed at the deluxe room for a night. The hotel is luxurious and has a contemporary feel. I love the high ceilings and large open views. It is also very conveniently located. Plaza Singapura is 10 min walk away. The hotel is surrounded by greenery.,5
Staycation at Hotel Fort Canning,ryutaka,"The stay really lived up to my expectations! The room was clean and the ambience was nice. The location was easily accessible by public transport though set amidst Fort Canning Park. Highly recommended activity was to get up for an early morning run at the Park, to breathe in the fresh air and then come back to hotel for breakfast and shower - how convenient! The staff was also very friendly and willingly extended my check out time so that I have more time for soak in bath tub at the middle of the room while watching movie!",5
Park Life Singapore style.,owen100,"This is definitely the place to stay away if you want to escape from the heat, traffic and general bustle of downtown Singapore. The location is superb, tucked away in a beautiful park (well worth a visit in itself), yet close enough to walk into the centre (downhill!), and a reasonable distance from the Metro.  The building itself is full of character, and our room was delightful, spacious and boasting a small additional conservatory style room with views of the park. The pool is a nice place to recover from a day's full-on sightseeing. Thoroughly recommended.",4
A pleasant and relaxing stay,Merilyn M,Reception staff is courteous.  Room is spacious and clean.  Décor is modern yet gives a rustic feeling. Mirrors everywhere.  Bathroom is clean with good supply of toiletries.  Fort Canning Park which is nearby provides fresh clean air and good for morning walks after a sumptuous breakfast at the hotel.  Shopping mall is within walking distance so save on your taxi fare  :),5
Celebration Central,pgeary2016,"From the moment we arrived, we were met by Ruby, who had us checked in quick smart.  The rooms are lovely, quite spacious, loved the very high ceilings.  At the bar, we were met by Erika, who from that time on looked after us and was always quick with a smile and ready to chat.  She also remembered our drinks every time without any prompt. Thanks Erika !! In the restaurant, The Salon, we were looked after by Grace, once again, always ready with suggestions for our day.  All the remainder of the staff were happy and courteous at all times.  The location of this hotel is so perfect, within the park, it is so quiet and peaceful.",5
Highly Recommended Stay,NA181920,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful colonial style hotel. The hotel service is impeccable with very friendly staff and nice facilities like the gym, swimming pool with scenic view, steam room and sauna room.  Not forgetting the spacious bathroom with a huge bathtub facing the Fort Canning Hill that offers a very breathtaking and tranquil view ! - See the appended photo :)  The location of the hotel is very convenient as it is a stone throw away to the malls, eateries, museums and mrt station (dhoby ghaut).  Would love to stay in this relaxing and beautiful hotel again :)",5
Love it,Yeo D,"I am staying at the canopy garden room, very nice personal space outside, will be better if the bushes between neighboring units are thicker (more privacy) Will be nice if insect repellent are provided, I am bitten multiple times by mozzies and some bugs at the canopy area. Well, really enjoy the lush greenery around the hotel, very nice swimming pool too.  Will be back again soon!",5
Love the hotel,Cherie L,"Love everything about this hotel. the only pain point happened when i was led into the room by a service staff. she was trying to show me the different amenities in the room, and how to operate the TV etc , which was really thoughtful! However, she had her shoes on and basically walked around the whole room without taking them off. later she realized the tv controller was not working so she got a technician to come fix it, and likewise he walked around the room without removing his shoes.   through 1 day stay, i floor felt very dusty and i was quite disturbed by it. but overall, great hotel!  will definitely be back again",4
Great Hotel,John W,"Friendly customer service by all staff, spacious clean room, great location, wonderful walks close by and in easy distance of central Singapore. Thoroughly  recommend this Hotel, either on a stop over or while on holidays in Singapore.",4
A hidden gem,glchan,"A beautiful property centrally located in the city that provides a respite from the hustle and bustle.  Immediately upon arriving at the hotel, the hubbub of the city feels a world away.  The lobby and the rooms are tastefully and elegantly decorated, the ambience soothing.  Highly recommended whether you are visiting for business or pleasure.",5
"Very beautiful hotel, but can be better",bells_ringing,"Evidently, the old colonial glamour of the building has been preserved, and tastefully touched up to fit the bills of what a boutique hotel is now expected to be.   Service was slightly slow, and there was a slight mix up of reservations. The service at the hotel restaurant was really quite inattentive, though I think this was because they were severely under staffed that night. Nothing too serious, staff were friendly, and of course, there's much room for improvements in terms of attentiveness and impeccability.  Food in the hotel restaurant wasn't fantastic, and felt it was quite overpriced. You are better off walking to the city to have your meal.  There's complimentary cocktail and wine in the evening.   We had the deluxe room, which was beautifully designed. Bathroom was…",3
Stopover at Fort Canning,Zip Zing,"With a couple of nights stopover to break up the trip between NZ & UK the location suited as its a very peaceful spot in Singapore, I've previously stayed in Orchard Rd hotels and as much as you are in the heart of the action the Fort Canning is a little more laid back. Service was at a high standard when required and the room was very High tech modern & tidy, the bathroom was very modern and large in comparison to te bedroom. The swimming pools were great to get away from the Singapore heat and luckily were under utilised whilst I was there.",4
Awesome stay!,RoseAnnabella,Love the interior design of the room & bathroom.  The room is spacious & clean. The customer service is friendly & did their job very well. The place is walking distance from the town area so its easy for you to get some food. We will come again in the future,5
Good hotel,Benjamin G,"One of the more memorable aspects of the hotel was the evening cocktail session in the lobby that is open to all guests. The photos attached show some of the food that was served together with wine.   The members of the staff at HFC were polite and friendly. Great shower and bath tub but really bad soap, so bring your own just in case. The beds and pillows were really comfortable too.  Breakfast was simple but very decent. I would stay here again. ",4
Nice Hotel,Sandy H,"I came to Singapore to attend my friend's wedding which took place in Hotel Fort Canning.  It is a very nice hotel with comfortable and bright room.  The staff are all very helpful.  Guests can enjoy free happy hour drinks and snacks at the private lounge from 6pm to 7pm.   Hotel guests have chance to mingle and relax.   I think this is a very good arrangement.   The only slight improvement needed is the bathroom, for some reasons, water always come out after shower, probably because of the gap in the glass door.     It is not a big deal and I didn't even informed the hotel.  Other than that, all facilities are very well managed.   I'll choose this hotel again in my next visit to Singapore.",4
Beautiful,gazzabaz,"Hotel Fort Canning is in an amazing location, peaceful and quiet in the beautiful Fort Canning Park. This is a smaller, more intimate hotel and is decorated and in keeping with its ‘old world’ charm.  Our room was large and the bathroom a true delight.  We were on the 3rd floor and overlooked the Orchard Road side so had amazing views of city lights at night.  Don’t let the photographs of the bathrooms put you off if you are one of the more modest types, they come equipped with ‘push button’ privacy blinds on all windows.  The huge bath was fabulous to soak in after days spent exploring Singapore. Although an up hill walk on the way home, it was well located and close to Orchard Rd, Clarke Quay and other great destinations. The happy hour, offering free drinks and canapé to…",5
Good experience,Effie H,Enjoyed my stay with very friendly and polite hotel staff all around! Room was spacious and I did not even need the lift as the stairs made going to the lobby or restaurant so convenient. Breakfast was fine and the spread was reasonable. Checked out the swimming pool which had a baby pool and a medium pool. Highlight would definitely be the rooms.,4
"Great staff, structure, location!",Lian-Hee W,"Before coming, I was already impressed by the location and its historical significance. Unfortunately, we don't see a lot of interesting photographs inside the hotel that tells the building's history. The staff has been most amazing. I particularly am impressed by the superb services of Mdm Grace Fu and to Miss Erica. There are quite so many others whose names I wasn't able to catch because I keep forgetting to wear my glasses, but Grace and Erica really stood out in their sense of dedication, sincerity and professionalism.",5
Quiet retreat,Eastc0asters,"We had a wonderful 4 days at Hotel Firt Canning. Easy access to Orchard Road and associated shopping, the metro and bus stations and restaurants and facilities at Clark Quay. We liked the park environment and quiet in the middle of a busy city and because we liked walking,  10 minutes to all of the places above was easy. Older people or those with limited mobility might have to rely more on taxis. Our only issue wax the high cost of alcohol bug this seemed to be the case everywhere in Singapore. The free happy hour with canapés was much appreciated. The restaurant food was great and the pools relaxing and uncrowded  although the water was rather warm. Overall an excellent stay and we would come again.",5
Romantically classy n cosy..,WTunstall,"We've stayed in d most basic room. Ambiance was romantic, cosy n warm. Beautiful place to hav a wedding n dinner for 2. If ur into photography, u'll find lots of nice locations in d room itself. Down side, no bathrobe in our room, old Bose stereo/ speakers which only functional for old iPhone and not much fresh flowers. Overall, we will come back again with hope to see more new things, as this hotel brings us great memory of us being together n d staff are very well trained, polite and most of all, always serving w a smile..",4
Beautiful environment - did not regret it,Esther Chong,"I'm finally getting down to writing this review and this is quite an important one because I'm easily the one reviewer who has spent the most money at this hotel. We had our wedding banquet at the Grand Marquee the previous weekend and besides paying for the banquet itself, we also upgraded our stay to the Governor's Suite, had two deluxe rooms for family members, and two days before the banquet, we had a one-night staycation in the deluxe room. So yes, you can imagine how much money we spent at this hotel, and when you spend that kind of money, needless to say, you kinda expect everything to be perfect.   Wedding banquet aside - which went alright I suppose since we didn't hear any complaints from guests - I think overall I'll recommend this hotel to any traveller. It's in a…",5
Beautiful Building Beautiful Setting,490amy,"What a beautiful place! The staff are helpful and friendly, the surrounds are beautiful as is the building itself. And its a quick trip down the hill to Orchard Rd.  The rooms manage to be modern and exceedingly comfortable (especially the big bath with a view) without clashing with the history of the building. Would have loved to have time to have taken advantage of the free drink and sat in the bar which looked lovely.",5
Nice but not exceptional,hunnejia,Booked a deluxe room to celebrate our wedding anniversary with our baby girl.   We arrived early and our room was already ready with the baby cot. Good first impression. Room was nice and cosy. In fact we preferred it over the premier room and studio suite.   We like it that the hotel exudes old world charm with very peaceful and serene feeling. But dislike that it's pretty troublesome to get from the carpark to the room. Have to change lifts and walk under the hot sun/ long flight of stairs. Not too helpful especially when you have a luggage and baby in pram.   Called to have a late checkout because baby was still sleeping and hotel has also nicely agreed.  Hotel breakfast was just OK.  Nothing exceptional. Nice to have complimentary evening drinks and canapés at the hotel…,3
Home away from home,Charlene2801,"A comfortable boutique hotel that makes you feel relaxed like coming home.  7min walk to Dhauby Ghaut MRT which is convenient enough for young family and business travellers. However, not recommended for elders.  Surrounded by a beautiful park that separates you away from the hectic city life. Suitable for those who enjoy nature. ",5
a relaxing heritage hotel in town,IRIS08,"clean,tidy & relaxing environment, facing the green, easy to access to places of interest, walking distance to orchard road, is a idea hotel for business, couples, family & friends, good for having company function & wedding",4
Long check in/out,Taipan49,"Don't understand how we can complete all details on line and book a hotel, but yet they still have archaic software.  Printed bits of paper.  Writing items down.  Taking a 100% holding deposit, but when you check out, they cancel that and then re-debit again.  This is the first and last impression of the hotel, and it is a poor one.  They need to sort this out and get modern software.  It should be a 30 second process in and out.  Also the hotel is noisy as there is no sound-proofing through the doors.  Can hear everything said in the hallways.",3
Back to nature- Modern Day Garden of Eden!,PrincessCathie,"Hotel Fort Canning has always impressed me with their prewar historic building, friendly and personal staff as well as the well maintained hotel room!   We celebrated our 21st wedding at the hotel and were pleasantly surprised with a thoughtful cake that my man finished in seconds!",5
Excellent,salwa y,"My only complaint, the wifi connection wasn't that great. I stayed in the premium room. The room was bright and the alcove adjoining the bedroom was facing the park. It was lovely. I would definitely come back to stay here",4
Hotel with a Point of Difference!,Louis R,"Stayed here recently after selecting it due to its relatively central location to cbd attractions in Singapore, most are in specific areas where as Fort Canning is placed quite uniquely, being able to reach most areas within a 15-20 minute walk (except Marina Bay). The park setting provided some great peace and serenity. Boxes ticked!  Some people complain about stairs etc however we did not find them concerning given proximity to everything, plus cabs come super fast! In room tech features were fine, plenty of power points and we were given a tutorial on check-in. Two key concerns; To Hotel Fort Canning,  Please work on your hallways in regards to their acoustics, they carry sound extremely easily and the doors slam way too hard and loud- maybe some canvas artwork or carpeted…",4
A  great Hotel,Dallas D,"I stayed last week for a conference #SSEA2016 . The service was great, food was good and not too expensive. Rooms were good with nice TV and touch screen to operate lights, a nice tech touch. I would recommend this hotel as its a short walk to Orchard Rd.",4
Loved it,Tony Mitchell,"Such a fabulous hotel in beautiful surroundings. Staff very friendly, professional and couldn't do enough for us.  We stayed in a ground floor room with courtyard which we wanted to be romantic and secluded. It was just as the description said but a little overlooked by our neighbours left and right who could hear our conversations in the evening. Nevertheless, we loved the beauty of it. The room was also a little open plan with our bath tub right next to our oversized and very comfortable bed but we got used to it. We didn't quite get used to the toilet with a sliding glass door though!  The TV was large with lots of international channels and a British news channel and movie channel. Internet was good and we connected quickly.  I can only review the restaurant for breakfast as…",4
Fantastic position surrounded by beautiful gardens and close to many fine restaurants,winogabon,"The rooms are lovely, great beds, modern facilities, free wifi and a host of other extras like nespresso coffee machine ....large and modern bathroom , silent rooms, large mirrors on cupboards to admire yourself, desk and electric curtains...you will get a good night's rest here",5
"Very Friendly and attentive staff, nice environment.",Robert W,"The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The food in the restaurant was very nice, average price but small portions.  We had the Garden Room, and the toilet setup is pretty weird. The door doubles as a door for the shower, so you can only have one closed at the same time, and the partially frosted glass door doesn't give much privacy. Other people I know stayed in other rooms and didn't have this issue.  WE stayed for a 2 day conference in the hotel and I was very impressed by the consistently great service by ALL staff members, especially during the lunch and coffee breaks of the conference.  A large shopping mall is a 5 min walk away as well as a MRT station.",4
Central location with privacy and serenity,1612jc,"The hotel is centrally located in Fort Canning park, within walking/short cab distance to Clarke Quay. The hotel is a magnificent old hotel with modern, well-appointed rooms, great pool and gym with a quality restaurant. Wifi not the best, however staff brought me a router which improved performance.",5
Loved it,angeldgood,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights. This is a beautiful hotel. The park which surrounds it is absolutely beautiful. The staff is great, great location: 15 min walk to Orchard street and 20/25 minute walkNice clean room. No mold in shower.   The water press was good, not great. My only issue with this wonderful hotel is the fact that the room temp only goes down to 23 degrees and with the high humidity, it matters. We would  absolutely stay here again in cooler months",5
"Great hotel, but at a considerable cost",wpjr2,"The hotel is located at one of the most interesting parks in Singapore. The infrastructure is very good, confortable and safe. The breakfast is fantastic, one of the best I´ve seen, and it is very close to several stores and shopping centers.",4

Strong recommendation,Flora Z,"We had our wedding party at HFC and stayed there for 1 night. The staff there are very helpful and friendly. Facilities are good & well maintained and the food there are fantastic.  Most importantly, HFC's colonial architecture is so beautiful, we had taken a lot of actual day photos in & around the hotel. They all look wonderful. Strong recommendation to stay in HFC if you are looking for a quiet and romantic stay.",5
Unique and friendly,originaltravelbug,"Unique building with bright airy rooms. All the staff are really friendly, food is pretty good. Nice pools for enjoying Singapore's sunshine too. The best thing about it has to be the gym which is huge and very well equipped for keen gym goers.",5
Oasis of calm ,Sally E,"Exceptional hotel Finished off a five week trip with a stay for 3 days at this hotel.  What can I say from start to finish the hotel and its team exceeded our expectations .  Met with a warm friendly welcome from the very professional team on reception.  Complimentary drinks and canopies each evening were an unexpected surprise.  The hotel room was very beautiful with everything fully controllable from the TVs. As we had two single beds it was comfortable,  the space is dictated by the original architecture of this beautiful building.  Fort canning hotel is an oasis of calm in the heat and bustle of Singapore .  Would recommend to anyone who asked ",5
Quiet Haven in Busy City,Victoria B,"Having visited Singapore a few times over the years, this hotel was a gem of a find. Good but not great location if sightseeing, particularly for elderly or disabled as is on a hill with limited access. However we were there for a relaxing break and fitted that perfectly, great rooms, bathrooms stunning, but no bath robes and very hard to hang 2 towels, pools excellent although lack of shaded area, tough on those days the sun really shines. Restaurant and bar all offered great service and range, the cocktail reception hour a great service and throwback to the colonial era, in the perfect setting.",4
Superb!,Noriko F,"This is a hotel that has top notch customer service! I was very impressed when the front desk staff called me soon after I  returned from a late night dinner to tell me they had found my case (containing my bus passes, gym card, etc.) which I had unknowingly dropped somewhere near the entrance. Checking in and out were handled with extreme professionalism and courtesy.  This elegant hotel is located on a hill inside historical Fort Canning Park. Although the building is classical , my room was modern and sleek. The spacious bathroom has huge windows and overlooks the lush  garden. There is a full-size bathtub as well as a shower stall.

Everything was well till before sleep as unfortunately it seems to have wedding reception and staffs mentioned it will ceased by 10/11pm. However, the noise continue till almost 12am as it seems that we are surrounded by guest attending the reception and they are staying at the rooms around us too.  Ultimately, bed is comfortable, nice bathroom and huge space. Room is well-appointed with everything amenities you can expect from a 5* hotel. The overall experience is above expectation.",4
Unique place to stay,PerthHarry,"We have visited Singapore a number of times and have stayed in a few different areas. We really liked it here. It is very central, and not far to walk to Orchard Road and Clarke Quay - just be prepared for hills and stairs, but it is a nice walk in the park. The rooms are good and the history of the hotel makes it unique. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The best part was it really felt like an oasis in the city. It was so nice to return here in amongst the gardens after a busy day sightseeing. We would stay here again and wished we had more time to explore the grounds.",5

Great location in the middle of the city,michelcool,"Stay there for few days escape in Singapore and we were looking for an hotel which was central and didn't have a city hotel feel , spot on , so close to everything and very calm and tranquille , a real boutique feeling ,dont really feel there is anybody except when is breakfast time ..staff is pleasant and efficient ,rooms are well fitted with all the necessary amenities ,expresso machine, good wifi,high ceiling, perfect ..only disappointment was they service the room once a day ,which is ok when you work all day .food was good and reasonably price .Central location ,few restaurant in the building next to it , as you are on the hill you will need to plan the taxi in advance and their concierge is doing that very well .Great stay for a hidden Gem in Singapore",4
Very nice hotel in the middle of a park ,Fabrizio M,"Away from the routes bit central. Quite area. Spacious room, well fitted. Nice concept of the bathrooms. Huge windows overlooking the city.

The Second Visit,Siti Z,"Had an awesome second visit to HFC. The hotel has awesome amenities especially a bathtub with a view. The place was somewhat secluded and perfect for a short getaway from the hustle bustle of city life. However, the internet connection for the smart tv needs improvement. Plus, the speaker in the room should due for a change with a bluetooth connectivity so that other smart phone will be able to access easily. Overall it was a delightful and awesome stay with super friendly service! :)",4
Effort was made to cater to our vegan diet.,zhiweiliz,"My partner and I have enjoyed our stay with Hotel Fort Canning. The Deluxe Garden Room is spacious and clean and we love the open concept bathtub. There is effective communication between the receptionist and the kitchen. Our dietary needs were catered for at the complimentary evening drinks session as well as breakfast. However, as there was cheese in our evening complimentary snack, there might still be a lack of understanding towards a vegan diet which do not comprise egg and milk. Overall, we are still very satisfied with the service!",5
Quiet stay,uprightman,"Hotel room was decent, comfortable and quiet.  Pool was small and basic-looking.  Location is ok, if you don't mind the 10 min walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT.  Food at restaurants was good, enjoyed the outdoor barbecue dinner.",4
Great Location,Keith M,Very friendly staff upon arrival - late night arrival and needed boardroom to be opened to set up for the next day conference - no problem for the staff - kitchen remained open to serve dinner late !

"Lovely hotel, great situation, unique room!",Pauline R,"We stayed here because it was the British headquarters in WW2. The amazing Battle Box is within yards. This is worth visiting if you like history. It's the bunker where the Allies were hidden before surrendering Singapore.  The pool area, trees and situation are an oasis of calm and peace in a city. The staff are very kind and helpful. Nothing was too much. Breakfast is good. Our only negative was the room from the point of view that we would have liked a more private toilet. The bath in the room was fine. (Although we didn't use the bath because the shower was lovely) We found it hard to cope in the room with a lot of luggage as we had been travelling for 6 weeks.  The bed was very cosy. Our room had a damp smell but they put an ioniser in and it was better. We would return but…",4
Relaxing Couples Stay,Erica W,5 Star Hotel NEARLY worthy of all 5 stars. Experience overall was exquisite. Staff were friendly and very welcoming. Only exception where they may need some work is in cleanliness. There were some downers in the washroom that I was not too excited about but I was able to overlook that as compared to many other hotels throughout Asia Hotel Fort Canning was already beyond expectations. We utilized uber throughout the stay to get in and out of the property as it was situated in the middle of historic Fort Canning Park and due to the hot humid weather it was not a gentle walk.,5
OASIS IN SINGAPORE,MAGGIE O,"We stayed at Fort Canning Hotel for a week in February and very much enjoyed it. If you like historic old colonial buildings as much as I do then you will love this hotel. The inside of the hotel though is totally modern with all comforts.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is set in Fort Canning Park - it is lush and green and full of interesting plants. At every turn there is also a story to tell. In hectic Singapore, it is a wonderful oasis to come back to after a day's sightseeing and to wake up to in the morning.  A map of the park is obtainable from the front desk and there are lots of signboards in the park giving information about its incredible history. Amy, the General Manager leads a walking tour around the park - don't miss signing up for this if it is…",4
Beautiful take you back in time place but NOT 5 stars,hotelhotel777,"The quiet pool side surrounded by dense green jungle and flowers was especially a treat.  The staff are all very friendly, the ambiance just takes you back into a different time.  Really beautiful place.  However, a very important thing that separates a 5 star hotel from those beneath is flexibility.  I had a family emergency that required me to check out 2 days earlier than originally planned but management flat out refused to refund me for the last two days.  This is the first 5 star hotel in all my travels that treated me this way.  The short-sightedness of choosing immediate profit over loyal return business is unfortunate and is what disqualifies it as a 5 star hotel.",4
Amazing experience,Bal S,"The hotel exceeded our expectations in terms of satisfaction, location, service, cleanliness and room size. Staff are so helpful and will do anything to help you. The hotel in situated in the legendary Fort Canning park which has a very rich history associated with it. A bit of distance to walk to get to shops or underground station but the whole experience is well worth it. I am looking forward to going back there next year. Absolutely delighted!",5
First class hotel ,Ray B,Fabulous colonial style hotel set amongst the trees on the hill  above Clarke Quay.  The look and feel of the place relaxed us from day one and the hotel staff gave excellent service with nothing too much trouble. Great place to get away from the bustle of the busy downtown areas after a long day sight seeing. Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for old world charm.  10 out of 10,5
A delightful gem.  Unreservedly recommended.,gehdev,This hotel is for you if you appreciate:  A hotel that is not a hive of hustle and bustle A hotel that has style without pretension A building that is distinctive and period in architecture And surrounded by parkland Lovely pools Courteous staff who QUIETLY carry out their duties with courtesy Lovely breakfasts Sensibly priced restaurant and room service meals  I could go on.  This is the best hotel we have found in Singapore in twelve years of visiting.  So relaxing.  We were totally at ease here and hope one day to return.  I must mention Amy who represents the hotel to guests and who was so interesting to talk to and who was so keen to guage our feedback.  Another gem!,5
Top Boutique Hotel in Peaceful Location,Tomk9,"The Five-Star Hotel Fort Canning is a boutique hotel in a quiet park setting. It sits on top of the hill around by a nice park. Service, rooms, and staff are all great. look for those premium rooms where the bathroom is actually between the room and the windows like a patio. This is very unique and give you a bright experience vs. the usual window-less bathrooms. great lay-out.  Breakfast and restaurant was very good. Altogether a great weekend experience.   Do realize that the hotel is on a hill. Going to the subway or to other areas you will need to hike up the hill or take a taxi. it's not very steep, but some guests might not realize it before booking. Also I found the two pools substandard as they had no umbrellas for shade or cushions. Service at the pools was…",4
Excellent ,marmite724,A fabulous hotel with very helpful and friendly staff. Set in beautiful grounds and a short walk to the metro and Orchard Road.

A little piece of quiet tranquility in a very busy city,RLumber,"Excellent hotel within easy reach of MRT, attractions and shops. A country house or hill station oriented hotel with oddles of charm and comfort. Food was lovely. Staff efficient, friendly and very accommodating nothing was too much trouble, I was made to feel at home immediately even when checking in late at 3am. Loved it.",5
Room with Patio,Q5236YBmichelle," Five Stars! Loved our patio! Coffee in the morning and wine in the evening! Love Singapore! We will be back!  The breakfast was spectacular, but the wait time for service at the restaurant was on the slow side at times. That is the only complaint I could make.  ",5
Location Location,Sunnyc0astgirl,"It is great when you travel to find yourself in the middle of town, great room with huge bathroom, close to everything but also in quiet peaceful accommodation then include the historical background.  This hotel has it all and is also surrounded by parkland which is beautiful.  The Hotel Fort Canning was the original home base of the British Forces in Singapore...it has been beautifully restored for the 21st century and our stay here was fantastic.  We also ate at the restaurant one evening, where  the food was great and well presented while the staff were wonderful.",5
Wonderful Anniversary Staycation away from busy Singapore,mademoiselle_happees,"So I bought this Anniversary Wedding Package directly from the hotel's reservation office, the reservation officer Ms Maggie Chow is very helpful and I really appreciate the assistance and extending offers to make our stay more memorable. From the day we arrived at the hotel, during the stay and 'til the day we checked out - all the staff were great and accommodating! Thanks everyone and special mention to the names that we have remembered that truly made our stay awesome and sweet! Job well done - Ms Ruby and Ms Cielo of Front Office, Lucille from Salon Restaurant, Catherine? - the bartender :) Thanks once again! and hoping to see you again soon!  Wouldn't mind coming back and definitely will recommend to my friends and colleagues!",4
Highly recommeded,773douglasw,"The Fort Canning offered so many advantages than other hotels we have stayed at in Singapore.  It is a beautifully restored historic building.  The room was very large and the bathroom (with a big bath & shower) was huge in comparison to others. It is within easy walking distance to Dhoby Ghaut MRT with connections to 3 lines and Orchid Street main shopping district. The buffet breakfast was great value and the dinners were excellent and not expensive.  We will go back next time in Singapore, no question.  Do yourself a favour!",5

A different boutique experience in the heart of the city,Pr1ya_k,"I was impressed with this hotel as soon as I walked into the lobby. A beautiful colonial style building and amazing service. You actually sit down at a desk when you check in, now which hotel does that? At check in I enquired about an upgrade and I was shown all the rooms and then upgraded free of charge, although I have to say the standard room was lovely anyway. There is a nespresso coffee machine in the room and the biggest bathroom I have ever seen in Singapore. The bed was comfy and again the hotel has style and character. service was good at check in and outside the guys will help order a taxi and load up bags which is so nice. I really like this hotel because it's quirky and the hour free drinks and canapés is brilliant to meet other guests if you're travelling solo. The…",4
The hotel needs renovation,anonymousK6579XD,"brown stain mark on toilet floor and furnitures are old. no usb plug, creepy window at the corner outside of the bathroom window, hotel façade is old. hotel needs renovation. location is good except for the long stairs from hotel to park mall. overall, service is good.",1
A place to be!,L5394TOmaries,We highly recomand this charming hotel. We only spent one night but the tranquility and confort of the room allowed us to recover from our 12 hours trip to Singapore. blabla blabla blabla 200 characters is a bit too much,4

Wonderful to walk outside into the park and see the ancient tropical trees. Short walk to National Museum and pleasant walk over the hill to Clarke Quay.",5
Pretty grounds and comfortable airy rooms.,Jeanne C,Hotel restaurant has the best Laksa I had in Singapore (and we tried quite a few elsewhere).  The pool is wonderful and very clean.  Easy access to the subway.  Central location with a beautiful big park around it-- we saw wild chickens with baby chicks waddled across the street one day! ,5
Short stay,anthony s,"Good 5 star hotel, reasonably priced relative to similar hotels. Helpful and attentive staff. Clean, spacious and modern rooms; bath was actually in the room which was a nice difference.  Wifi was fine. Front desk organised cabs, checked correct terminal at airport.  Happy to recommend.",5
Nature enclave within the city!,Hui Hui,"We chose this hotel for a staycation due to its location within nature but yet so close to the city! It is only 10 mins walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT and malls! The room is clean and we had a good rest on the comfy beds. The deep soaking tub made us so relaxed and while brushing our teeth, we could enjoy the city view right in front of us. We also love the high ceiling of the room and the mirrored wardrobe. The pool is great as it does not have the smell of chlorine.  Signages were not so clear and layout of the buidling is a little confusing. You need to push the room door after tapping the room card, which feels a little odd. The wifi is a little hassle as you have to log in each time you enter the room. Will be good if bathrobes were provided.",4
A nice place for especially for couples,Shunmusica,"I came here for a staycation as I just got married at that time. Of course I expected it to be different and believe me it is. The place is definitely a bit far from the nearest train station and to get here, taxi is by far the most convenient. Well, the service was of course exemplary and since it is near the registry of marriage, anyone would know that this is a hotel mostly catered for newly weds. Am i right? The room I took were big and there is a bath tub in the middle of the room plus the toilets were made of glass and see through. It was comfy at the same time awesome for newly weds but not for family I supposed. Maybe there is a family room but since I was a newly wed as well, it was perfect for us. Other than that, breakfast was ok and overall, I give it an excellent…",5
Almost there ...,j1954g,"We had a six-night stay at the end of January and, in spite of particularly hot and humid weather (and coming down with an unpleasant cold), enjoyed our time here.   The positives were:  The pools - lovely for swimming and relaxing, particularly the lap pool, which is very refreshing. Comfortable loungers; it's great to lie back and gaze at the clouds, the hawks circling overhead, and the bright green birds flying in and out of the mature trees in the park outside. Just what you need after intensive sightseeing (of which we did a lot.)  The setting - good to be away from busy streets and general frenetic pace of life. Not too far to walk to Orchard Road, some malls, and Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station. We made huge use of our MRT passes and never took a taxi except to and from the…",4

"Prompt, efficient service with a smile.",Gary S,"We arrived late at Hotel Fort Canning (HFC) from Laos via Bangkok looking for some R&R.  We ended up getting out and about for the 6 days were were in Singapore .... so much for the R&R.  The staff at HFC, firstly Eric and Abigail at reception were excellent in giving directions and maps etc, and Lucille, Frenzy and Avi at breakfast pouring the cups of tea into us to give us a head-start for the day was appreciated, and always with a smile and a 'you're welcome'.  There are those people behind the scenes that we didn't meet from the chefs to the domestic staff that made our stay very comfortable.  Well done, all!!!  We will come back.",5
Very Disappointed,sjo50,"Had such high expectations for our stay here (and that may well be the issue).   The hotel portrays itself as 5 star but don't be mislead (as we were), it is OK but in no way great.   I could make a list of shortcomings but here is a representative sample....  1. Toilet was in the room(!). 2. Bar closed early (for us that is - 10:30/11pm) 3. One tiny bar of soap for basin & bath for both of us for 3 days. Not even refreshed! 4. Cost of transfer from airport - $190 (Singapore) - added 50% due to supposed airshow which was none existent. DON'T USE THIS SERVICE.   The location (which has nothing to do with star) but you should be aware of, is away from the main centre. Taxi or significant walk to downtown each day.   There are (I would suggest) wither be fit of hindsight better…",2
Very prompt service,jchen230,"service is very good with very prompt reply and even birthday card printed with my fiancé name. However, pool is rather small and we are disappointed to find not much facilities to enjoy. To add, the room we were given has open bathroom concept. And the shower door cannot be tightly closed. The end results is the marble floor besides the bed is all wet after showering. Although we tried to dry it, it's hard to make it thoroughly dry. And because marble floor is more slippery, I nearly had a fall when I get off the bed to go to the toilet. It's rather dangerous considering the bathtub is just besides the bed. Any fall and knock on the head could be dangerous. We appreciate the good service but will really urge to relook into this open bathroom concept. Ensuring the shower door…",4
Great stay!,Rosheni N,"We had booked the hotel to celebrate a special occasion and the hotel had given us a free upgrade! So that really made a great first impression. We were also allowed to check in about 1.5 hours before official check-in time at 2 pm. Room was beautiful, especially the huge bathtub.  From 6-7 pm we were given complimentary drinks and canopies. However their selection was highly limited to one type of red and white wine. And the food was too little that we didn't even get to try some as they were finished as soon as they were put out. The selection of food was limited to just a few types as well, this compared to other hotel lounge odurves.  Breakfast spread was a little limited too, but still we received.",4
A haven of peace in a busy city,tim11_sparrow,"A beautiful venue hidden away in the centre of Singapore, offering a welcome respite for the bustling city.  The staff are very professional and attentive, but not robotic in any way, each having a personality that shines through any interaction.  The hotel is quiet and there never seems to be the crowds normally found hanging around reception in peak hours.  With a definite colonial feel to the decor, it is still modern and everything looks very new.  The room was larger than the standard Singapore offering, with an extremely comfortable King Bed, a good sized and well lit desk, a huge bathroom with Bath tub, and rain shower, and nespresso coffee machine.  The room was clean, but we did find mould in the fridge and some of the towels had stains, but were obviously freshly…",4
Fort Canning Hotel - Graet Value for a place of history,JPETTLEY,If your looking for a great stay in Singapore and enjoy a peaceful setting then Fort Canning Hotel is the place for you.

Great hotel with an amazing history,wananavu12,"Hotel Fort Canning started as British HQ in Singapore, it it situated on Fort Canning  Hill in the heart of Singapore amongst lush park land. The hill was once the domain of Malay royalty.   The building has been gutted and reconfigured into a rather quirky hotel with some interesting original features including pillars and  a grand staircase. To keep these features there are some compromises with lifts being not centrally located which can be a nuisance at first but you quickly get used to it.   Rooms are all electronic which is a bit of a challenge to get used to at first, we stayed several days so not really a worry after the first day, for overnighters I  suspect some confusion throughout. Some labelling on the buttons would be a simple solution.  The are several power…",4
Handy location in renovated old British barracks,Webster27,"This is a great location - although if you don't like walking you will not get the appreciation of the nature reserve surrounding the hotel and the close proximity to pretty well everything in Singapore. Free wifi and internet connections were part of the room deal.  We walked to the Marina, Clarke Quay is 10 minutes, the CBD, Little India, Chinatown, the SMU and more are all within easy walking for reasonably fit folk. The walking meant exercise after meals!  The hotel's two pools were beautiful and clean and deserted most of the time so this was very pleasant for privacy. The cocktails and canapes at 18:00 were a good way to ease into evening meals in town.  We had a 'premium lux' room which came with a large bath and walk-in shower. We had a view out towards the park lands.…",4
A peaceful heaven in the city,quack23,"Just love the peace and quiet of the hotel. You don't encounter bus loads of tourist or noisy children around. A perfect place for couples, those on honeymoon, those who want some peace and quiet to be away from it all"". The room ambience was lovely and being situated in the park, it makes a convenient place to go for an evening stroll or a morning workout.  it is also within walking distance to Clarke Quay and subways. The hotel also offers evening cocktails where you can unwind before dinner. Recommend booking city facing room as it is brighter and I think bigger then the rooms facing the park. The only down side was the wifi did not work so well during my stay. Not sure if this was due to the telco company network as the TV programs were also not working and the Telco's…",5
Not as fine as it can be,joyce018,"My husband and I booked a 4 night stay, but moved out after 3. The location is lovely, but being up on a hill also means a small inconvenience getting cabs. It's fine walking down all the steps to get to Dhoby Ghaut MRT. The room was not finished to the  level I expected seeing it had won awards. There was no luggage stand. Only bath towels and small face cloths were provided, no hand towels. The toilet flush (eco) didn't flush well and overall quality felt cheap. The marble floor had stains, and was especially icky in front of the toilet bowl. When we decided to change hotels, the counter staff did not bother to ask how our stay went, even after my husband said he wanted the cab to take him to another hotel. A pity. I think the hotel actually has so much potential. I hope it…",3
Lovely location for a Singapore stopover,Jane T,"We spent three nights in this lovely colonial building and enjoyed every minute of it. Beautiful spacious rooms, excellent service and a great location. It felt like we were staying in the middle of botanical gardens - though there was a lot of walking up and down stairs to reach to our destinations. Within the grounds is the Pinacoteque de Paris, an unexpected delight as we were able to view the most marvellous European paintings on our own! Our room was comfortable and well set up. The breakfasts were very good. Walking distance to the National Gallery, Clarke Quay, Orchard Rd etc. Would certainly stay here again. ",5
Beautiful Historic Hotel in the Park but mind the stairs!,Angelica P,We booked into the Hotel Fort Canning for 4 nights as a stopover on our way from Thailand back to Australia.  I was very impressed with the room.  I simply adored the high ceilings and colonial feel blended perfectly with modern luxury.  The marble bathroom was so spacious and luxurious.  I only wish I had the opportunity to have a long soak in the deep soak tub.   The shower pressure was the best I've had in Asia and the Nespresso machine in room was very welcome.  The high-tech controls in the room were easy to operate and made me want to rethink my home set-up!     The breakfast buffet was quite extensive with many western and eastern dishes.  The food was always hot and fresh.  The dim sum was a particular favourite as was the fried chicken which was done in a variety of…,4

Now it is a lovely hotel in an unbeatable location, hard to believe in busy Singapore. The staff are very good, especially a young man called Kelson Yeo. He is a very smart young man with very high standards, he certainly helped us enjoy our Singapore stay a great deal. It's unlikely that you'll have problems there, if you do - Kelson's your man.

Disastrous and Ruined Wedding – Do NOT Consider as event venue!,Alan P,"My wife and I recently held our wedding here in January 2016.  This was nothing short of disastrous but before I go into detail, I will at least point out what was positive.  1)	Firstly, David, the Sales Manager was fantastic throughout.  From handling my first email enquiry, to meeting with us multiple times, handling all our questions, showing flexibility in our requests, David demonstrated a reassuring capability to manage our requirements while always being super responsive and extremely friendly throughout.

Once we had all arrived, we were ushered into The Salon, and upon making inquiries we were told that it was a set item for the afternoon tea (we had several who were allergic to seafood and wanted a non seafood option, and a couple of vegetarians as well) we were presented with another menu, from which we could order other items. Drinks were ordered along with a variety of food, and I must mention our group of 21 were the only ones present.

Great stay. Big bathroom with open space view,yala ben,Weather forecast shows raining throughout the week. I wanted a day stay and a seperate bathroom away from the room for a change and this is what I am looking for. I made the request online through booking.com (I used both tripadvisor and booking.com) for a third level quiet room as I am here to retreat. The bathtub was big enough for me to relax and they provide complimentary magazines. Excellent service in hotel from room service to the man who greet you at the entrance. I give a four star as there is a carpet smell along the door way (I am allergic to carpet) overall great for value and great stay. The breakfast was good! ,4
A deliberate and nasty move.,rolliedoo,"My friend and I visited Hotel Fort Canning for the second time in a row for New Year's Eve countdown. The first time was lovely, the room was clean and the environment was peaceful. I can't say the same for the second time. We booked the deluxe room and was told that we will be given a free 'upgrade' and the staff showed us to our room which we agreed to.   This deluxe room with patio, was located on the first level, nearest to the reception and the bar. It was raining heavily that day so the huge balcony outside was redundant. In fact, if you minus out the balcony, the room was smaller than the previous deluxe room we stayed in. And then it was midnight, the countdown began and we were not prepared for the extremely loud music which took place at the bar just a few steps away…",1
Fantastic oasis in the middle of Singapore,bushmammal,With all the ultra-modern hotels you're spoilt for choice in Singapore but Hotel Fort Canning offers you a bit of old-world colonial charm with an ultra-modern twist.

Beautiful quirky hotel,nutmeg_marvin,"Having spent two nights at the Marina Bay Sands while my other half attended a conference, we then moved to the Hotel Fort Canning for our second two nights.  What a difference!  Here we felt like we were treated as individuals rather than part of a machine.    The hotel is located in an old colonial building within a beautiful green park, away from the busy roads which gave it a peaceful feeling from the moment we arrived.  We were quickly checked in and shown to our room, which was an upgrade from the one we had originally booked.  We loved the room - beautifully styled but still keeping the heritage details.  The hotel offers complimentary drinks and nibbles each evening for an hour at 7pm which we took advantage of before heading out to eat.  The breakfast buffet was very…",5
Great hotel in the middle of Singapore,Natasha M,"Hotel Fort Canning is very nice in every way. The rooms feature high-tech - touch panels for lights and the ability to control lights and temp from the TV using the remote. The inside is modern, clean, and the breakfast is superb. The location is very interesting -- easy walk to the National Museum, Art Gallery, Spice Gardens, and Dhobi Ghaut MRT station. What more can you ask for? Ah yes, there is one thing -- a stronger wi-fi signal in the rooms. The wi-fi is very good in the public areas but the hotel expects you to use wired internet in the rooms. What about people who rely on their smart phones for everything?",5
Perfect From The Time We Arrived,wayne j,"(This review was for the 27th December to 1st January) From the moment we checked in we were treated like we were the only guests at the hotel. Kelson and Ruby made us feel so very welcome and the problem other travelers have with just 2 check in desks shouldn't really be an issue as this is an 80 room boutique stay, not a 300 room resort. We waited just under 10 minutes but hey no big deal, soak up the place and get to know what the building and it's history is, it's worth it, I can assure you. We were booked in for 5 nights. The first night we stayed on level 3 in a Premium Room right near the magnificent stairway, which was beautiful, but was a tad noisy due to the comings and goings of other guests. We asked to be moved which was not a problem at all to another Premium Room…",5
Lots of potential but fails to deliver,mariposita,"I have stayed at this hotel several times and this is a long delayed review. Each time I visit I feel that the property has so much potential to be a 5 star boutique hideaway in the middle of Singapore but there are just several little imperfections that causes it to fail to reach its mark. I find that a real pity because it has so much potential to be a top notch hotel, particularly for the prices you pay for the room.    The hotel is housed within a colonial styled building in the quiet and gorgeous enclave of Fort Canning park. Location-wise I find it perfect because although it is secluded, it is only a 5 minute walk right to Dhoby Ghaut station through Park Mall, right in the hustle bustle of the city. The grounds are also wonderfully integrated into the park and the first…",4

We had booked a garden suite and had a small issue after checking into our room whereby the occupants of the room a few doors down were being very loud and disruptive (this was late afternoon and we were concerned it may get worse although by no means any fault of the hotel), my partner asked the lady on reception if there was anything they could do and they moved us and upgraded our room within half an hour, this was completely unexpected and so generous of the hotel.

The hotel is an oasis neatly tucked away in a park and it was extremely convenient to walk to the Dhoby Ghaut mrt station (5 mins) or take a lovely 10min stroll through the lovely Fort Canning park to Clarke Quay.

Nice period hotel,cameramel,"Overall this hotel is great. Smart, modern rooms with excellent features. Fabulous swimming pools (choice of two one informal with gardens and the other more suitable for lengths). To say that Fort Canning has a fascinating history ( British headquarters and then Japanese command center during the second World War) there is little to show of it's past. The bar and reception area is a little austere and not a particularly nice area to relax in. The exterior patio is great but the garden furniture is very uncomfortable. Breakfast is superb with an extensive range of delicious food. The range of egg preparation is particularly noteworthy. The staff are excellent and very courteous and helpful.

Beautiful Romantic Hotel,Jonathan W,"First off,  it's not cheap,  but for a special night or two away it's well worth it.  The building is stunning and well maintained so it does feel luxurious.  Nice little touches like free wine,  champagne etc at certain times. Our room was great with an exceptional bathroom.  The floor to ceiling window overlooking the park was a little unnerving at first,  but they do have blinds of course.

However the sofa looks a bit worn out and the space is quite dim even with the light on. Thus we spend most of the time in our room instead as we prefer natural light. Guests can also enjoy a wide selection of music i.e. Jazz, Classic, French Italian, etc, via the TV, and we are pleasantly surprised to find Ella Fitzgerald, and Norah Jones in the selection.

The bathroom had a waterfall shower head and also a large bath, with lots of nice little touches including 2 bottles of water for free.

Hotel has a cocktail hour in the bar. Breakfast was beautiful and the service was amazing. Totally worth the money to stay in this hotel. I will be totally booking this hotel…",5
Beautiful hotel with a cozy room. ,filfelicity,We stayed at HFC (garden room) for my husband's birthday. It was a very cozy room with a patio where we had a candle light dinner. The bath tub was next to the bed so we could relax in the bath tub while watching the television. The door to the toilet is really interesting as you are only able to close either the shower or the toilet at one time.   The hotel manager was really sweet and surprised my husband with a birthday cake and card. We really enjoyed our time there. The staff were really friendly and helpful. ,5
Not a 5-star hotel,Stanley2008,"I have been to Singapore many times and usually I stay either around the Marina or CBD.  This time I decided to stay in a different part of town.  I was reluctant in booking the hotel because it's not in the Top 20 TripAdvisor ranked hotels in Singapore.  Hotel Fort Canning is a colonial building in the middle of Fort Canning Park.  It's not as ""grand"" as Raffles Hotel, which I stayed last year, but nor is the price.  Check-in was quite painful.  It's not at a traditional counter but at a desk, which there are/was two.  Both desks were occupied when I checked in so I had to wait maybe about 10 mins before I could be seen too.  The front desk staff didn’t seem to make me excited to stay in the hotel.  Her voice was monotonic delivering scripted lines.  To use the lift to get to…",3
"Fantastic find - quiet, relaxing and out of the bustle - but so close to everything!",jwils642,"My partner and I stayed here from the 18-Nov to 24-Nov 2015 (always find that useful in the body of these texts).  We were really pleased with our hotel selection for Singapore.    For the price and the rating, we had some hope that it would live up to the reviews, and I'm pleased to say it did.  Check in staff were attentive and quick to welcome us and escort us to our room.  We arrived late in the day, and were lucky enough to have been upgraded to a premium room, which gave you the 'lounge/office' in the small room with the floor to ceiling window, and the bathroom separately.  The room itself was perfect, A/C was effective and easy to control at a reasonable temperature when on (usually find A/C is either too cold or not effective!).  Bathroom was big, but the shower did…",4
Gem of the City,Edmand Cheung,"A heritage hotel in the Fort Canning Park which is quiet and nice but yet only a short while away from Orchard Road, Clarke Quay and Marina Bay.

"British Legacy, but",ibrahim996,"This is a charming small hotel with excellent location. It is  only10 minutes walk to,Orchard  street with Its brand name stores and retsturants. The hotel is a bit dated but still retaining the old British charm. The rooms are nicely appointed but without the WOW factor.  The happy hour is provided near the front desk area and is not so happy at all. It's a self serve corner with a couple of wine bottles and fruit cocktails. Service is excellent and it's what makes this hotel extra special. In all, I I'll give it 3 out of 5 stars. ",3

"Location location location, almost there",Anne H,"We slept very well, it was deliciously quiet.  I want to be very positive about HFC as so many staff were anxious to please, sweet  and very obliging, but it had its frustrations.  Design over convenience in the lower rooms.  The throne like bath in the middle of the room is a trip and toe stubbing hazard, the toilet and shower sliding door is ok but there s little room for even average persons knees when closing the toilet door. some people complain it looks tired, but being finished in lovely marble and stone, these stain easily giving a dirty appearance when actually very clean, just not spotless.  The wifi was in and out hit and miss, breakfast staff really attentive, all I asked for was provided and then anticipated, but selection seemed limited by comparison to other…",4
A small oasis in the city,ElMa1983,"I stayed 11 days in this hotel and I thought it was great.  Plus: great rooms, very good room style and architecture, fantastic location, boutique style service and approach, splendid service, great in house Italian restaurant. A small oasis close to busy and noisy orchard road  Minus: can take up to 15' to get a taxi on spot so leave earlier for your destination.  For some the fact it's somehow isolated can be an issue, I personally was looking for exactly that.  Definitely recommend and good value for money.",4
It's on a hill,onefoottwofoot,"If you are on foot... beware. This exceptional hotel is on a hill. The stairs are a bit treacherous and steep and are much worse when it rains.  Very welcoming staff but know much about the surrounding area. The usual answer about the area was 'I'm not from around here'. Just so you know... Clarke Quay is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Loads of restaurants and shops. Much better prices and selections than what the hotel, offers as far as food goes.",4
A touch of elegance above the hustle and bustle,richard l,"Sitting high above Orchard road on the edge of Fort Canning park, this Hotel offers a touch of class with great service and accommation. Our room was upgraded to a deluxe one and the room was spacious and bed comfy, whist the bathroom was stylish with a stand alone bath and roomy shower.

Musty room spoils it all,hotspot78,"I had high hopes for the hotel as it was a beautiful hotel with a excellent location; right in the city but far from the hustle and bustle of the main roads. It had a romantic feel to it and the lobby was very elegant and chic.  Unfortunately, I was met with a musty smell once I stepped into the room. It was also very humid in the room and did not had the 5 star standard that I was hoping for. I had a room on the first floor and there was no view. Definitely not recommended for a romantic getaway.  The restaurant was also small but the food was good. Staff were attentive and courteous.",3
WOW,ozpix,"Wow wow WOW wow Wow !!!  What a great hotel. Booked this hotel because of previous great reviews & interesting photos etc. We loved our stay here. A fantastic, grand old restored building in the middle of a beautiful park in the middle of one of the world's great cities. So close to everything yet extremely quiet & peaceful. We stayed in a huge premium room with a separate sitting & desk area & the bathroom to the side would have to be the one of the nicest & biggest I have ever come across in a hotel. All the furniture was very nice & modern tech stuff was pretty cool too. We loved hanging around in & out of the larger swimming pool which was a very short walk from our room.

It's a very well appointed hotel, with professional staff who are very helpful. The be honest, other than a swim and a quick drink at the bar we didn't really spend too much time at the hotel, except to sleep. We had a beautiful suite overlooking the pool. Very well appointed, quiet and comfortable. I have no great knowledge of Singapore, but this hotel was an excellent choice for us.",5
"Stunning rooms, park setting",2DadsWithBaggage,"One of the greatest things about Hotel Fort Canning is it's location, set inside Fort Canning park and it's gardens, walkways, museums and historic places of interest - all within a very short walking distance. The views from the hotel overlooking the park and the downtown skyline opposite are impressive. I preferred this to staying in a downtown highrise hotel.  The rooms are spacious and gorgeous - ours had floor to ceiling windows in the living area and the bathroom(!) which required you to close the automatic window covers each time you had to use the facilities. Walking into the room and looking out on the beautiful park through that window as a nice surprise each time.

Quiet Hotel in a park in busy Singapore,Paul C,"Hotel Fort Canning is a quiet hotel in a renovated colonial building in Fort Canning Park - a green Oasis in the middle of busy Singapore.  It is within walking distance of the subway and the retail area.  Room are comfortable and larger than average.  The only quirky aspect is erratic water pressure in the shower.  As a smaller hotel the concierge service is limited, although the staff always try to be helpful.  While the hotel is full of character and the swimming pools are excellent, the downside of the quiet surrounds is the need to walk 5 to 10 minutes down to the subway and the retail area.  Not so bad on the way down, but it can be more of a challenge on the way back up the hill in the heat and humidity of Singapore.  We would stay there again if visiting Singapore.",4
Great possibilities ......,Phillip H,"We stayed on the top floor. The room was certainly worthy of 5 star and the staff were helpful and friendly. But little things let them down. In a 5 star hotel you expect :- -rooms to be serviced by afternoon, -plenty of milk in fridge for tea/coffee, -used soaps, shower caps etc to be replaced, -corridors to be vacuumed daily, -cooked breakfast items to be kept hot, -pepper & salt, & milk on each breakfast table. Located amongst lovely gardens and with two pools this hotel has great potential. The complimentary drinks/canapés each evening was a nice touch and very welcome. The hotel just needs a little more attention to detail.",3
Peaceful and charming,Adam M,Short walk to Orchard road and very friendly staff. Historic location with beautiful gardens and very quiet setting.

Really nice lobby but room smells musty,eh_al_ex_el,"I was surprised that the room smelt musty on our arrival; it's probably  due to the fact that the hotel is situated in the middle of Fort Canning Park itself.   The bed was comfortable and the Deluxe Garden room is a couple's room, with an open-air bathtub and a toilet with a translucent glass door, so take note when booking.   We had to call the staff a few times but I wasn't very impressed. Calling for a bottle opener took ages, and a bucket of ice costs $5 after the first one. I would have thought that this kind of service would come free if we are paying for a 5-star hotel.  This is a hotel less known to tourists, and I saw more locals when I was there, if that's to your preference. It's also a popular wedding venue so there might be some noise in the day.

"Gorgeous rooms, bad food, bad location",Asheas,"Hotel is located in a charming, colonial building atop a historically significant hill. It exudes a brand of old grandeur that might appeal to some, in spite of its multiple faults.  Location: As mentioned, it is on a hilltop, so unless you are prepared to climb your daily exercise up and down, prepare some good cash for a cab. Even after managing that trek to sea level, you need to be savvy enough to locate the nearest metro station, which is nowhere convenient (for me at least!).  Room: If you can brave the poor location, you'll be rewarded with tastefully designed, modern and colonial style hybrid. The smallish room is charming, but with effective space management that doesn't look tacky. You've got full amenities available, e.g Nespresso machine with complimentary coffee and…",3

This is not luxe but a reasonable 3.5 to 4 star hotel in a good location.  Rooms are decent size and good layout.  Reduce your expectations, this is not luxury but it's an ok hotel in a central part of Singapore, easy walk to Clarke and Boat Quays.  Good pool but minimal outdoor furniture and no bar service.  The gym is good but entrance feels subterranean damp.  It's a more interesting location than, say, staying on Orchard Road but it needs decorating and staff need better training; their directions to local attractions were woeful.",3
Great stay,Edwin K,"I was having honeymoon in this hotel. The room is very modern and sophisticated. The bathroom is spacious. The hospitality of the crew is very helpful, warm and welcoming.

Dinner is very great, was having a great Angus beef burger and Calzone. Definitely will come back someday.",5
Great hotel after a busy day of work ,Dave B,Very nice with great amenities providing a great value for the price. Quiet and low key atmosphere after a busy day. Close enough to walk or a short cab ride to a wide variety of restaurants. Definitely would stay here again.  Keep up the great work.,4
"Luxe Hotel, but Doesn't Quite Deliver",Ferlinghetti,"At the end, a likable place.  I'd come back again, mostly for the pool.  So why the low (for Trip Advisor) rating?  Well, in a luxe hotel, you expect luxe.  And this only delivers it some of the time, sort of.    Much that is good, for sure.  First, the setting.  The hotel is in the middle of a lovely park on a hill overlooking Singapore.  Gardens, an art museum, the remains of an old fort.  Quiet.  Lovely.  Perfect, I thought, when I booked the room.  Not the usual Singapore commercialism.   The only trouble is that this is a perfect site for weddings.  Perfect.  And in Singapore, weddings aren't quiet.  So if you happen to be seeking a quiet, secluded garden hotel, make sure you book when there aren't any weddings.    See, the promise is quiet, the delivery intermittent.  What…",3

Deluxe Patio,Joo,"Booked a deluxe patio. Room was big, especially with the patio extension outdoors on the ground level. However, the patio didn't offer much privacy. Perhaps, should surround the patio with taller trees.   Staff was very kind to lead us to the room and explained several functions in the room. I felt the functions were a little too high-tech. Too many lights, though it was nice. Requested for a DVD player, but if I wanted to watch normal TV, I had to call the reception for them to unplug the wires for me, too troublesome.   The room was nice, but the shower room had a flaw - water could easily flow out from the gap, causing that portion of the room to be wet.   Overall, nice and historic hotel.",4

We asked for the park view but were told on check in that all the King rooms faced the City and all the Twin rooms faced the Park.  This is not true as we noticed King beds on the Park side each morning, being made up by the housekeeping staff.  We had a nice view of the YWCA.  The room was dirty and smelt of must.

The room was a mix of new technology and old world charm. For example the room had very high ceilings with electronically controlled curtains. Total room lighting controls on both sides of the bed that would illuminate from the heat of your hand. The hotel was previously used by the British as an administrative building in World War II.

Canapés and drinks hour daily very generous. Easy walk to Clarke Quay for bars / restaurants / river cruise and lovely setting in the park (well worth a wander) which avoids congestion of main streets. Taxis cheap and easily available from hotel to main sights. We got taxi to Flyer one evening, Raffles Hotel, Marina Bay Sands and malls on Orchard Road. All under £5 a trip. Taxi to zoo £12 each way about 30 minute journey. Would stay here again if return to Singapore. ",5
Beautiful setting **** and a half stars. ,Mulie,Enjoyed three wonderful evenings at this hotel. Gorgeous high ceilings and beautiful settings -- that's an under statement !  The park is an added bonus and creates the most serene atmosphere (there were three weddings over three days during our stay).  I was lucky to enjoy drinks and canapés in the guest lobby area.   The only criticism I have is that there could have been newspapers offered or some papers in the hotel lobby/reception area. Bath robes would have also complimented the experience.   House keeping were incredibly friendly and our room was spotless.    The gym and pools were impressive!   There is an iPod docking station but you will need a converter for the older model- incompatible for iPhone 6+.  There is also a Nespresso coffee machine and a variety of teas.…,4
Hotel Deceit?,No_Happi,This hotel left a bad taste when I was informed at checking out that it would take 3 WEEKS for them to refund the $300 deposit they demanded at check in.  Really? In this day of e-commerce they are going to take 3 weeks to refund my CC? Stinks of deceit or what?,1
Place of Solace,PillowBook,"Nestled on a small hill just a stone's throw away from the night scene of Clark Quay in Singapore, this hotel was refurbished with modern classy interior. (Even a touch panel sliding door that leads to the washroom) With only a few floors and limited rooms, you need not worry about having your peace disturbed.  However for its price, I think the establishment could really do much better with its limited cable channels. Hotel Fort Canning is really a place to enjoy on its own using their facilities, at added prices of course. Could also use more space for a writing table to work on. I would rate this a 3.5 overall.",3

Was hard to get a taxi and the English language barrier was more difficult than other hotels in Singapore. When we even organised a 'pre booked hotel' 45 minutes prior the concierge still had not called when we came down to get it.   Came home one night for a drink after dinner at the hotel bar and there was no staff on so the cleaner had to try and serve for us- I don't think this is good enough.   Another disappointment was when entering doors with staff at the same time the staff did not give way to us. Being hotel guest I would expect the way to be given to us.

Far from the best,Andrew L,"Stayed here for several nights whilst on holiday in Singapore. Set amidst greenery in a renovated colonial style hotel, my first room on the second floor was large, comfortable and airy, with an unusual open plan bathroom (with the bath literally right next to the bed!). The second room I stayed in when I had to extend my stay by one night was much smaller and less comfortable on the ground floor and had a distinctly damp feel to it - I'd have had to request a change if I'd been staying another night.  The lobby check in area is extremely over perfumed, and spending any length of time in it made me feel a little queasy after a day or two. However the most serious drawback to the hotel fort canning is the truly abysmal Internet access. Extremely slow and would repeatedly log me…",3

Breakfast is excellent offering just about anything you may think of, and the restaurant has a good menu for lunch & dinner. Happy hour every afternoon with snacks & wine. Swimming pool, of course, and sauna/steam bath on the lower level. Anything in the rooms can be remotely controlled via the big flat-screen TV.

On the whole, our experience has been great and in Singapore, after staying at the Fullerton at the start of our trip, I decided on the converted colonial Fort Canning Hotel. We checked in a few hours ago and I am wondering if we made a mistake. The rooms are lovely but I find the attitude of the staff lacking.

A somewhat different experience in Singapore (a positive one),Alexander,"Excellent boutique hotel in Singapore which is totally different from almost all other hotels in Singapore: first of all it is a building from 1926 which was the former British headquarter during WWII and there are just a few other hotels such as Raffles or The Fullerton with such a heritage. Then it is amidst a wonderful park (Fort Canning Park) which does mean that it is surrounded by lots of green. At the same time it is totally central: you can walk through the park and reach Clarke Quay within 5-10 minutes.   The rooms are quite nice.

Beautiful hotel tucked away in Singapore's greenery,consultantck,"My friend stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and it was a very pleasant stay.  The rooms, tho large enough for only 2 persons max, were comfortable and well appointed.   The hotel is tucked in a lovely hill and public garden, but still very much in the heart of the city.  Public transportation is a bit inconvenient and one has to use a cab to get to and from the hotel to any destination.   It is an excellent alternative accommodation to the typical corporate traveller and it may not appeal to the leisure visitor.   In-room dining offered a good selection of delicious local & western foods.   The Nespresso machine in the room made it very convenient to have a good cup of coffee without having to order it from Room Service",4
Even better than the first time,frenchyBrisbane,"Not that the first time was bad however I liked this room (202) better, it had a little room to sit in and the bathroom was on the side rather than being part of the bedroom. Service was friendly on all accounts, special to mention to Grace in the restaurant in the afternoon and evening, who is  very friendly, helpful and has a great smile. Wine and canapés between 6 and 7 was welcome. Loved the lap pool, the seat covers need a bit of care.

Horrendous email marred a good visit,ChongPaoer,"The hotel is quite quaint and certainly a nice hotel for a weekend getaway.  The rooms are nicely decorated and the use of space is intelligent.  It's also near town without being subject to some of the noise and bustle that a convenient location may entail.  However, I was shocked to receive an email on the night after we checked out accusing us of consuming a can of beer (a Heineken as well, yuck) and asking us how we would pay for this.  First, it's rather odd to demand payment for a lousy ten dollars if you style yourself as a five star hotel.  Second, I found the whole accusation completely off-putting.

Good hotel - just a few improvements needed,JorIB88,"Hotel Fort Canning is located in the middel of a large and beautiful park. It´s easy to get there with a car, and its no problem to walk to/from the hotel.  The walk down to the marina takes about 20-25 minutes, and its a nice stroll.  We got a room on the 3rd floor of the hotel. A large room with a tub in the middle - very cool. However, the room could have been cleaner, and you can also see the ""wear and tare"" rather well.

Definitely not a 5-star hotel,Hannah_Nat,"My partner and I stayed here over the Jubilee weekend for a romantic getaway and we chose it because of the secluded location away from the hustle and bustle while still being in the city. For that, the location was ideal for us. The hotel sits amidst a lush, green park and it was quite a site to behold from afar.  However, upon closer inspection, things changed for the worse. The hotel touts itself to be a 5-star property but it's more like an average 4-star property. The rooms on paper seems big but in reality are quite cramped due to odd placement of the balcony/lounge doors.

Very peaceful hotel,Bostonmich06,"Check in service was great - front desk staff walked us to our room. Room was beautiful with automatic blinds and marble bathrooms. Pools were a little disappointing, but overall hotel was beautiful. I would highly recommend.",4
Absolutely Gorgeous!!,Leshel03,"One of the best staycation we ever had! The service was excellent, checked in and out was a breeze and smiley staff made our day! We were thrilled when we stepped in to our room. Very unique layout with the toilet and bath facing the garden. We were on the 2nd floor so we didn't feel the lack of privacy. The thing my husband enjoyed the most was their free flow of prosecco, wine and canapes between 6-7pm, very nice gesture from the hotel! Breakfast was semi-buffet which we enjoyed thoroughly. Location of the hotel is not as inconvenient as we thought. From the carpark to Parkmall, it's just a 5-10 mins walk. Though location is in the middle of the city, we felt that we were overseas! We will definitely be back again to this lovely hotel!",5
Weekend visit ,Christianvsch,"Hotel is in a good location, very central. Located in beautiful park area. Check in not very efficient, staff member spent a lot of time on phone for private issues.  The rooms are average in space, bathrooms however exceptionally large and modern. Rooms are well equipped, bed is very comfortable. Generally the rooms need a touch up, as they are a bit tatty and worn  Pool area and other amenities are in a good state and of good quality.  Food from a la carte is good, breakfast recommended.   Hotel has no kids facility, kids menu etc.  All in all the hotel needs at least a touch up, or even a renovation. The facilities are a little worn down and tatty. For the room rate of a 5 Star hotel, this can be expected.",3
Thank you HFC!,CalebChay,"I was seeking for a suitable staycation package earlier this year as I was intending to propose to my girlfriend on our anniversary date. During my search, HFC Reservation Manager, Maggie Chow patiently responded to my numerous questions via email. This cemented my decision to book their ""Love Blossoms Package"" for my special occasion.  To my delight, I even received a complementary upgrade to their best Suite upon check in! The room was impeccable in terms décor, comfort and cleanliness. During my stay, I was thoroughly impressed with the courtesy, speed and attentiveness of the staff.

You forget you are in Singapore,OLeary1,"We booked 5 nights at the Fort Canning hotel because we wanted to have some time to relax before flying home after a very busy time.  We have had many trips to Singapore but this time our criteria was - somewhere quiet but not too far away from restaurants, in a green and leafy area and a small hotel with a good sized pool. The Fort Canning was perfect. Our premium luxe room was a good size with very comfortable bedding, a small sitting area by a large window over-looking the Fort Canning Park– a negative was that it only had one easy chair (we should have asked for another) and the rug needed a good clean; a desk with a seat, plenty of wardrobe space and a large bathroom with a bath and shower.  We only had to walk to the end of the corridor to get access to the pool area which…",5
Pleasant stay,Jeffyyc,Check in was breeze with attentive front desk staff. Room is well equipped and had one of the best day coach i evet sat in.  Dinner at 'The Salon' didnt start off well with 30 mins waiting for 1st main to be served n my partners dish served another 15mins later.  Thankfully for grace fu(a server) whom serve with sincerity and positiveness! The whole dining experience was much better.  Comes with facilities like swimming pool n gym. Hope to be back soon.,4

Escape in the heart of Singapore,Mark J,"Stayed for a week on business and was very well looked after.  Pools are amazing.. I do a lot of swimming and those pools are probably the clearest I've ever swum in, just magic. Gym is also very well equipped.  Breakfast doesn't start until 7 so if you have an early start plan for breakfast somewhere else.  If I was going to be picky I was in a downstairs room and the internal door to the next room was not very soundproof but a minor issue.   Thanks for a great stay",5
Great ambience; recommended,George T,"I love returning to the Hotel Fort Canning. Situated on a hill surrounded by beautiful jungle/park landscaping - quite apart, yet within close walking distance to shopping and restaurants the historic hotel features a great nostalgic ambience reminding of Singapore's colonial past. Rooms are generally well appointed, many with stunning hill-top views onto the city; great facilities for sports (walking/jogging walkways in the park surrounding the hotel; a very nice lap-swimming pool; gym facilities). Only disappointments were (1) breakfast dining - with rather disappointing (3*-calibre at best) selection/offering and level of service, and (2) Wifi (free) which turned out to be unstable and spotty at times. Can nonetheless recommend this hotel.",4

Sitting in the lounge there is a constant stream of people being talked to by the F&B sales staff ---- not a pleasant place to sit because of this   We stayed in the rooms on the ground floor..sound proofing is poor ...we were awoken by the sounds of ""passion"" from a couple next door in the middle of the night ....and then their subsequent showering kept us awake for some time.

Poor service,alison450,"We had a short stay in this hotel and were disappointed with the poor service. For example on the first evening my daughter's first choice of cocktail was not available and the second took over 20 minutes to be brought; housekeeping only made up our rooms after 4pm despite the fact that we had been out since 8.30am; at breakfast we had to hunt for some one to take an order; the concierge desk was often unmanned, and so on. We put it down to a lack of any visible manager. The rooms were fine but they were replacing the wall paper in the passages and we had to clamber over this on our way to our rooms on arrival which was not a great start. In all I don't think this hotel was value for money.",3
Price doesn't match with the quality & facilities,A L,"I spent 3 nights in this hotel because of the organizer chose this hotel as the venue for trade show.   The hotel cost over Singapore $330.00 per night (5 stars hotel rate) & I expect this is a 5 stars hotel.  When I arrived the hotel entrance, only a small counter without anyone to assist you.  After check-in, I entered the room and couldn't open my 29 inches suitcase without closing the door. The washroom was spacious with a big bathtub in the middle of the washroom. After cleaning my face, I couldn't find any hook to hang up my face towel. May be it's a kind of ""Architectural Protection Building"" but still need to consider how to provide an user friendly environment to the customer.

Lovely hotel surrounded by greens,Angie_YW,"First time staying in this hotel and I was impressed. The control panel in the rooms are all with just a remote control and for those who love nature will fall in love with the surroundings. Hotel is clean and service is good.

Classy Hotel Stay,JSD-Toronto,"I stayed at the HFC because i was attending a conference which was held on-site. From start to finish HFC provided superior service. Check-in was breeze, the room was stunning. In fact I loved the bathroom so much i decided to replicate it in my own home. Food was good though somewhat overpriced. The pool was the perfect temperature this June and the quiet nights made for the perfect business trip. There is a lovely park to walk through just behind the hotel and if you want to eat some authentic food, there are some lovely restaurants just 5 minutes walk away. The famous clark quay did not disappoint. over all a wonderful stay with hopes to return. Its worth it to spend a day to half a day exploring the city with the hop-on, hop-off city buses.",4
Excellent,Smartchill,"Stayed 4 nights in 2 separate rooms with my children who are 20 and 16 Well appointed, modern rooms with excellent bathrooms and very comfortable beds, the few times we contacted reception to ask for something to be bought to the room someone came immediately. Staff were very helpful and friendly and the grounds are well kept.  Gym was one of the best I've been to in a hotel with modern equipment and a good blend of machines. Buffet breakfast had a great selection and the food was fresh and well presented. Would definitely recommend if you want a hotel that's in the heart of Singapore yet has a secluded feel due to its raised location and tropical grounds. Close enough to walk to Orchard or a 5 minute taxi ride.",5
POSH,John F,"This hotel reeks of old-fashioned posh:  port-out:  starboard home--designating a level of comfort unattainable to most travellers. The property is a marvelous combination of British colonial--with tiptop Asian and technical--influences. Begin with breakfast:  dim sum, a real treat for us Westerners; but, a European or American treat is also offered. Depending on the day, you can order something Dutch or something Mexican or something else. I rarely ask for eggs Benedict, but I did here and was glad I did.

However,it would be better if the hotel could consider building a wall or something to separate the outdoor area of this room from other rooms.the garden of other rooms were just separated by some potted plants so there wasn't much privacy,we could literally see and hear what our 'neighbours' were doing at the garden!

There may not have been a concierge outside to valet our cases but just inside the door, the reception staff could not have been more helpful and took our cases to our room. We were given the choice of two rooms and we took the upgrade to the studio suite!  The staff were polite, courteous and helpful - nothing was too much trouble - top marks to them all.

The Nespresso machine couldn't dispense coffee properly, the mini fridge could not be opened. Obviously it was locked but later when i checked out they told me it wasn't. More than 5 people tried opening it. And obviously a MINI fridge door doesn't lock itself so tightly.   Later on to the night, i had delivery to send me ice. Thus, 5 of us went down to carry them.

Despite check in not being until 2:00pm, the staff happily advised us to return at around midday and they would have a room ready for us - a great gesture given our near 13 hour flight... When taken to our room we found our luggage present and our first impression was quite simply ""Wow"".

We stayed there for 7 days. We enjoyed every bit of it. The bathroom is stunning. Don't worry about the windows, no one can see you during the day time but make sure you close the curtains at the night.

Wonderful location and fantastic staff,Alice R,"Although I agree with some of the other comments about the small size of the room and the 'soaking' of the bathroom floor; overall I loved my stay at Hotel Fort Canning. The bathroom is large and amenities were very nice. In regards to the floor getting wet, I would put a towel down. It resolves the issue and is common sense? The room was very nice - small but not crowded. The hotel staff were very helpful, welcoming and friendly. I loved the pool, however, the cushions were a bit damp so make sure to bring your own towels. The hotel is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is the only one in Singapore like this. It is in a fantastic location, as it is very close to Orchard Rd. I would highly recommend staying here for the location and excellent customer service.",4
I wish I could join the enthusiastic comments of others ...,Arne K,"I was staying in Singapore for 8 nights on a business trip and selected Fort Canning as an alternative to the usual Orchard-/Scotts-Road hotels. While standards on first sight seem to be at par I've noticed a fairly large number of issues which, as an overall conclusion, lead me to a mediocre rating as I found them really annoying over time. Just some examples: - power-plugs: only one power outlet at bed-side (would you be travelling with your wife you knew pretty well whose smartphone will not be charged overnight). Even worse: no (zero!) power outlets in the bathroom (the designer is apparently wet shaving). And HE is male - have you seen your wife using a hairdryer and no mirror nearby? Me neither ... - bathroom: Due to the ""room design"", the bathroom occupies the window side…",3

I was also intrigued by the location in the middle of serene Fort Canning Park. However, when my partner and I arrived at the hotel, we found that it was just a little bit different to what we were expecting.  SERVICE There was no one to assist us with our bags as we entered the hotel. Walking towards the reception, we were greeted by ""Checking in?"" instead of any type of polite greeting.

Beautiful quiet old hotel with modern conveniences in a stunning park setting,Gwm-Traveller1,"The Fort Canning Hotel offers something quite different in Singapore. As a heritage building it has been turned into a lovely hotel, with gorgeous comfortable rooms and great views (ask for a higher floor) over the Fort Canning Park. The park also offers a great setting for an early morning jog or walk.  The extra touches such as cocktails between 5 and 7 while sitting on the lobby terrace was a nice touch.   The only disappointment is the pool area, which really looks like a last minute thought, is not that inviting, which in Singapore is something many tourists look forward to. It is also important to plan ahead during peak hours as getting a taxi, something which in Singapore represents a challenge at the best of times, can be a nightmare.

""but the building is over a hundred years old.""   the building is quite modern, my only complaint being the toilet flapper not sealing well, requiring a second action to ensure the water stop flowing after flushing.   the grounds surrounding the hotel are another completely different matter.   well appointed walks with a point of interest every hundred or so meters. it was difficult to do my morning brisk walk, because i had to stop every 2…",5

Mattress was too soft for my personal preference The washbasin mirror is a small round mirror and small counter space. Inconvenient for applying makeup / styling hair.

Great Hotel!,walter s,"Stayed 9 nights. Having lived in Singapore for 7 years prior to this visit, decided on Hotel Fort Canning for the following reasons: peaceful and quiet location away from the hustle and bustle, central location (walking distance to Orchard and Clarke Quay), not a traditional holiday hotel (not a lot of loud and misbehaved children running around), two beautiful and quiet pools, intimate atmosphere and nice views from the rooms. Gym is large with lots of equipment and not many users so excellent. Service is overall excellent but the bartenders need to study their drinks manuals a bit.

The breakfasts were to a high standard with plenty of choice. The location of the hotel is great also. A small walk to the sights, set in a great garden and close to transport links. All you could ask for. We'll be back there in the future",5
Good location,muckyboots_11,"Stayed here for 5 nights after trekking in Nepal. Excellent staff, efficient check in/out. The location in the park is lovely and quiet, yet only a short walk to  Probably best for stays without a lot of luggage, although storage away from room is available.

An oasis sanctuary amidst a bustling city,Peter L,The lush greeneries embracing the nostalgic structure of fort canning hotel will make you feel that you are immersed in a sanctuary amidst the business of orchard road/Penang road which is a 5 minutes walk away. Exemplary service from fr,5
Great hotel very calm,Ian Millar,A very Nice hôtel 10 minutes away from orchard street by foot. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are well appointed with free and fast WiFi. Breakfast is also very good. If you are looking for calm in the city then this is the place. One small gripe is that the in room controller for the lighting is complicated. Difficult to get all the lights off. Would recommend this hotel,5
My favourite hotel in Singapore so far,YannYng,"Hotel Fort Canning is nested within the Fort Canning Park. Though not high-rise, it is surrounded with green which is really rare in Singapore. I have always love old conserved buildings converted into hotels for its charm.  Have stayed at Fullerton Hotel (with Marina Bay view) and Movenpick Heritage Hotel (not much of a view) and a few other  hotels in the City Hall, Tanjong Pagar, Orchard and Marina Square area prior to Hotel Fort Canning. Hotel Fort Canning is my favourite for the tranquility and quaintness it provides.  Love how they have ""outdoor"" bath indoor.   Love its location too as it is a short 10-15 minutes walk away from the Dhoby Ghaut MRT which is an interchange for three MRT lines in Singapore. Dhoby Ghaut area also offers a wide range of eating, shopping and…",4
nice and quiet,Jeff C,"It feels like a resort hotel in the middle of the city.  the facilities are new, the location is historical, and the staff are friendly.  While there is no direct access to public transportation, it is only 3-5 minutes walk downhill to find public transportation, and only 15 mins walk to raffle city.    the rooms are a bit small, but the bedding and toilets are comfortable.  i would definitely stay here when i return to Singapore.",4
gorgeous oasis in the middle of Singapore,Luckyducky1970,"We had 3 nights at HFC and it is a beautiful hotel,  set in Fort Canning Park in a historic building that has been renovated into a classy hotel with understated elegance.  The bathrooms are a bit quirky and better for couples and singles rather than friends traveling together.   It is about 5 minute walk to Dauby Ghout MRT station and is an easy walk to Orchard Road.  The staff are all super friendly and helpful and there are 3 beautiful pools.  I loved our stay at HFC and would happily stay again!   Thank you for your hospitality!",5
We both really enjoyed our stay!,MayaRed,"A very relaxing hotel close to orchard road, yet very quiet. Good facilities. 2 nice outdoor pools and a good gym. Free drinks and canapes in the evening an excellent touch. The only reason it didnt get 5 stars was the amount of weddings coming and going. although it didnt really bother us, I could imagine it being off putting for people wanting a quieter stay. I Would definitly stay again. ",4
Good choice for a staycation!,Kristen,"I stayed at this hotel during the 1st week of Feb.  The decor & layout of the suites, & the fact that a soak in my Fort Canning hill facing bathtub would keep me a captive audience of squirrels at play... with the occasional hummingbird & eagle in flight- are good enough reason to choose this hotel for a staycation.  But, there are other strengths to this hotel as well : I'd rave on stellar staff- Dinesh from the restaurant. His service is close to perfect. ... Plus, the depth of passion this hotel's team has for both the hotel & their job shows. They quickly put to satisfaction every request or complaint raised.  Good choice for a staycation!",4
UNFORGETTABLE WONDERFULL EXPERIENCE,Mogens D,"My wife and I stayed her for seven days in february. The hotel is perfect, so is the crew. We can give it all the stars possible. The internet worked perfect especially on the ground and the first floor, and at the pool area as well. We can not recommend this hotel enough.",5
The coolest hotel in Singapore,AyiManila,"This is THE hotel in Singapore. Been to so many here but this was such a gem! Spoke at a Conference here and the organizers booked this hotel for me. What a pleasant surprise! The renovation of a heritage building was done with such respect. I think they have only a few dozen rooms but what rooms! High ceilings, beautiful furnishing and a bathroom located in what was once the terrace! Terrific service. Wonderful food. And complimentary wine and finger food for ALL guests in the afternoons.  What a pity I stayed only for an overnight stay as I had to get back for work. I highly recommend this beauty. What a discovery!",5
Mixed Review,David H,"We stayed at the hotel as our friends were getting married there. The rooms are nice and interesting, but there are al window walls in the sitting room and bathroom. A little unusual as not sure if you an be seen from outside the hotel. One issue we had was with the4 quality and choice for the breakfast.  Not very interesting and pretty boring. Definitely not value for money. The main issue was when we left the reception after the wedding about 20 friends of the couple went to the bar for cocktails. We were advised by the bar tender he was closing? After 10 PM and on a Saturday evening with 3 different weddings at the hotel. Even the hotel staff asked that the bartender take care of us, it was not until I advised him that I was going to speak with the manager as a guest of the…",3
great location without garden,PieterdeN,"Except for the absence of both the doorman and the receptionist at our arrival, we have nothing to report but good news. Modern rooms, good internet, extended breakfast buffet, happy hour (18-19h) and attentive staff. The maybe deceptive issue here is that one would expect a garden around the premises, but there is only the public Canning Hill. So the outdoor terrace is tiny if not petite and the larger terrace is occupied by what looked like a permanent tent for festivities of all sorts.",4
A getaway from a busy City,Edo Kutemo,"We decided to take a short getaway. After many search, we decided to try out Hotel Fort Canning. the price wise it ain't cheap comparing to other hotels in the city. when we arrived at the hotel the first thing we noticed was the surroundings, was very quiet. despite how close the hotel was to the city. we checked in and escorted to our room. the room was big. so big that there was a bathtub in the middle of the room. the night something went wrong with the aircon, but the hotel staff handled the matter quickly and professionally and arranged a transfer of room for us. overall a good hotel for a getaway.",4

Not very kids /handicap friendly though as  not all the floors are serviced by the same lifts, probably due to the restriction of the colonial building.

"Great location, design, peace and greenery",DomPom,"For a romantic escapade or a quiet stay, a true boutique hotel, in a historical building, on the hill within a beautiful park, yet within within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping belt, and the restaurants and bars of Clarke and Robertson Quays.  The bathrooms are facing the outside of the rooms, the ones towards the city offering sun bathing while soaking in the tub.. pretty rare. Highly recommended.",4
oasis in a busy city,nita599,"Hotel Fort Canning has great modern rooms, all white marble bathrooms, as well as an excellent breakfast buffet including custom cooked eggs and pancake dishes.  lots for vegetarians too.  Three pools - regular, big one for lap, small shallow one for kids.  Outdoor deck and location in the middle of a park gives it the oasis feel.  We were surprised this hotel wasn't totally booked - only a few minute walk to transportation.  Restaurant has good food (try pizza and pasta) and is very reasonably priced.  Big windows in our room looked over trees and beautiful yard / green space.  lots of walking / jogging trails right outside the door.  easy walk to Clarke Quay. Highly recommend this one.  We will be going back.",5
Great place for a staycation,Sheevonne TW,"Hotel Fort Canning is highly recommended if you're looking for a short staycation due to the amenities, superb rooms, excellent service and of course, great location! The entire hotel looks like a structure right out of my history textbook while the premier room offered a great view out, straight into luscious greenery (which is rather tough to find in Singapore)! The eco-friendly air conditioning system is also worth complimenting and I love that the hotel has a very green and nature loving atmosphere to it. Great place to unwind and get away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore!",4
"Great stay surrounded by green, right in the heart of the city",Pieter L," The hotel's location could not be better: in the middle of a park surrounded by green, yet in still in the heart of the city at walking distance of anywhere you'd want to go.  The amenities are great: nice pools and the best hotel gym I have seen anywhere!  Rooms have lots of light, they are clean, modern and stylishly decorated.  What could improve and why I did not rate my experience as excellent was the service: - Breakfast last till 10:30am, yet at 10am the buffet ($25/day) is empty, not just on one occasion, but every single one of the 4 mornings we ate there. Having to complain about service is not how I like to start my day. - Towels by the pool are not restocked unless you call for them.

Beautiful park hotel - with some light and some shadow,vienna-onthemove,"This is a beautiful hotel in a calm and quiet setting - in the middle of the bustling metropolis of Singapore, but also in the middle of a huge park. We thoroughly enjoyed the setting, which allows you to walk out of the hotel door and explore the park or to walk to Clarke Quay or Chinatown or Marina Bay. We sure did a lot of walking... The hotel has two nice and quiet pools, which look out into the tropical park landscape.   The room (Deluxe King) was very nicely furnished, had a Nespresso coffee maker and looked out into the park. A glass door separates the bedroom from a ""study"", which makes the setup quite versatile. The AC and lights are managed by a central touch panel, a bit tricky but manageable...

A unique experience in Singapore,Dan A,"Singapore is well known to be a pretty busy place. Yet, that one-of-a-kind hotel, despite its very central location (a few minutes away from the most frequented areas of the city: Dhoby Ghaut, Clarke Quay...), you can't feel the hassle of the crowded streets, as the hotel is located in the middle of a beautiful park (Fort Canning).  Hotel Fort Canning proposes a very comfortable experience, mixed with the quietness of nature right outside the window.  The room we stayed in was pretty huge (facing the garden), and simply outstanding.  We will definitely come over again that lovely place.",5
Boutique heritage hotel lived up to our expectations,inspired_07,"Our family stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning for 5 nights including New Year's Eve 2014.  We were looking for a boutique hotel experience, something different from the generic type of multi storey hotel that prevails in Singapore.    Because one daughter and partner were coming from London and we were coming from Australia with another daughter, our bookings took some coordination.    Even before we left for Singapore, I was impressed with the service I received.  I had several conversations with the Reservations Manager, Maggie Chow, who was very patient and managed to arrange our bookings so that we were all close together on the same floor.  She even offered us a suite that was not normally advertised on their website in an effort to help accommodate us a little more…",5
Business ,Chappy C,"The hotel is a beautiful colonial building structure, nicely done. The location is great. Even though it is a stone throw away from the famous Orchard road, you don't feel that hustling and bustling actions and it's quiet enough for you to enjoy the tranquility; being next to the park and all. The room is spacious and the ceiling is very high. That helps making the room looks extra spacious. They convert the patio of an old colonial building into a bathroom area, clever. The only complain I have is that the cleanliness of the room, especially the bathroom walls and molding on the tiles' sealant. It's just gross. Other than that, if you are not in a hurry, ft. Canning is a place to be. Though it's near Orchard, it's a bit of a walk down hill to the main road. I would go back and…",4

Luxurious but Fails to Capitalise on Heritage,StephenLeeNZ,"Stayed here for two nights Jan 28, 29. Booked the Garden Patio room -which is just as well as the room would have been a little too tight were it not for the garden patio. After a day, front office called to enquire about our satisfaction with room etc; we outlined a few things that fell short of our expectations and offered to show staff what we meant - an offer which they took up to their credit. Examples of what fell short of expectations was outside bed in garden patio whose covering was slightly mouldy due to lack of protection from the weather (making it less than attractive to want to lie on),  mould around external doors, poor paint job in recessed ceiling in room ie. aspects which one would not expect from a hotel of this class.

Serenity amidst the bustling city,Kah Imn T,The stay is great. This is our 2nd stay. We were given a big room with a bath tub in the middle of the room. The bed is large.

The hotel is in a beautiful park well worth walking around every day, and is close enough to walk to Orchard Road, although taxi's are fantastic in Singapore.  We will certainly return to Hotel Fort Canning.  It's a beautiful old building with amazing history, with not too many rooms, in a great, quiet spot, but still handy to lots of Singapore.

We had a good feeling about this hotel from the moment we arrived.,OrderintheHouse,"My wife and I celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary in Singapore and Malaysia during January 2015.   In Singapore we chose Hotel Fort Canning to stay for 4 nights.    I can’t recall a more civilised booking-in process.  The reception at this boutique hotel had us sitting down at a desk rather than having us lean over a very unfriendly counter like at most hotels.  Once we were booked in, our receptionist Eric then escorted us to our room to show us all the features – how to work the air-conditioning and the expresso coffee machine and to turn on and off the lights from the TV screen using the remote control.  The Concierge took care of our luggage.  As hotel welcomes go this one would take some beating.  As we sat down to collect our thoughts after Eric left us we had a good…",5

Great Experience,knoxyk,"We had our travel agent book this hotel based on what I had read on trip advisor. Absolutely loved it.

Our room was immaculate, with 2 separate rooms, 1 for the bathroom with the highest ceiling and wall to wall marble tiling, massive window looking to the park and another room was an office/seating area. Everything was automatic, blinds, lighting & aircon. Our room had it's own Nespresso machine with a variety of coffees on offer. In the evening you could indulge in complementary wine & canapes.

Delicate Garden Hotel,Sabrina_Hsiao,"All the staffs are kind and friendly, such as the baggage service, the front desk, and the Glasshouse(breakfast place). At first, I wrote the email to request for the baby cot and the baby bathtub, and they replied they offered baby cot, but no bathtub. But when we arrived, besides baby cot, they did put the baby bathtub in our room. We really appreciated this. The most we loved was the pool, surrounded by trees, made us feel like resort, even the hotel is located in the city. There is only a tiny problem. Spot on the towel hanging upon the toilet. But I was lazy to complain at the hotel. Except this, it was a great stay.",4
"One of the best hotels, period.",OliverPasman,"We stayed here in 2011 and now again in January 2015. The hotel is amazing. It's located in the middle of the park, but right in the heart of the city.

Staff is very friendly, too.",5
Surprisingly peaceful hotel located close to the city centre,AmanJaain,"The hotel is a short walk from the Dhoby ghat metro station yet is well protected from the bustle of the city. It was tough for me to believe that the quiet, peaceful hotel was in the heart of Singapore. While the hotel lacked the grandeur of many other ""chain"" hotels it made up for it in the personal space - The pools were almost always empty and readily accessible and so was the coffee shop. To add to the beauty the hotel had evening wine and snacks on the house.  Though, I must knock off 1 rating point for the hotel because of the poor WiFi connections in the roomsa and the ill equipped coffee shop.",4

Beautiful Singapore,Michelle G,Stayed at Fort Canning for 5 nights over New Year 2015 and have a fantastic time. Location is perfect and easy walking to all sights.

Rooms are beautiful and expertly cared for by Housekeeping. Nespresso machine in room a big bonus. Stayed in a Deluxe King and bed was a full king with an assortment of pillows. Views of gardens beautiful. Thanks Fort Canning. Hope to see you again.,5

a shame they haven't made more out of it,Nicolai M,"I still wonder about this place and already had as I’ve booked it, as for Singapore standards it seems much cheaper than other places. Put it that way, location is great, you are a 10 min walk away from the main shopping area and even closer to Clark Quay (if you really want to go there) or Robertson Walk and with all that, the Hotel is located in a great park. The rooms are nice, I’m not sure if the idea of having the bathroom at the window with a glass wall to the bedroom is the smartest idea (as you have to close the blinds constantly when you are using it), but at least it’s a different approach different and looks good. The lobby and public area in the building are nice, the backyard has a big permanent tent for functions, seems most likely for weddings. The area in-between…",4
Beautiful and accessible to town area for shopping,Yap S,Hotel Fort Canning is very unique in its ways. I love the greenery they had out of the hotel which my bf and i took a walk through the greenery and was kind of lost. The good thing was there are signs to look out for. The hotel reception was really unknown to me as it was not the usual hotel that you enter where it is obvious with many people standing behind the counter waiting to serve you. My bf and I headed to the hotel pretty early and to my surprise the room was already available to us. The deluxe room that i had with a patio was not bad. Just that the toilet was a little too small and it felt a little too squeezy. The patio itself was spacial.

Wonderful 4 days in HFC,Sue H,"We spent four days at the Hotel Fort Canning before departing on a cruise.  It was most comfortable and enjoyable.  The room was large with the bathroom on the balcony, and city views. We were able to walk easily to Orchard Rd area and loved the fact we could take a walk in the park itself, just outside the front doors of the hotel, without crossing any roads. A large green oasis in the middle of the city with beautiful old trees. The staff were all excellent and the free canapés and drinks at Happy Hour were much appreciated. HFC is a modern hotel inside, but still retains the spledid exterior facade of the old colonial era.",5

From check in until leaving the staff were excellent. We had a late flight out and our luggage was stored for the day and on our return we were given access to shower facilities before leaving. The breakfast was of a high standard and it was great to eat in the glass house surrounded by trees and birds whilst the city was only a short distance away!  Whilst the hotel has been built to a high standard and the rooms are large and well presented, the one thing I didn't like was the design of the bathroom as there is little privacy. The bath in the middle of the room was a nice touch and the rain shower one of the best I have used. Overall a…",4
Holiday in history,gmacman,"We stayed 6 nights at Hotel Fort Canning in February, a beautifully appointed historic building set in an oasis-like park in the very centre of the city - and will stay there again on any future visits to Singapore. Staff are outstanding - friendly and very helpful, the decor is extremely stylish, the rooms are beautifully appointed and the building - the former British military HQ - is imposingly grand. As we were visiting, in part, for a WW2 commemoration service, nowhere could have been more appropriate. Excellent breakfast (see other reviews) and dinner was also very good - so good, we became too lazy to explore restaurants in the town. The only point to note is that the peaceful location is out of the buzz of the centre - a trade-off we were happy to make.",5
Break from city life,T-ManSG,"Spent the weekend there with my wife for our wedding anniversary. Stayed at room 216, had the park view. Love the room for its rustic design with the high ceiling and marble tiles. All the staff that we encountered from the front desk to the glass house (their restaurant) were very friendly.   My wife & I loved their breakfast pancakes, really light and fluffy. Enjoyed our stay at Fort Canning, definitely would visit again.  Thanks!",5
Two sisters enjoying Singapore - we would choose this hotel again!,Helmimeri,"So peaceful, clean and such a friendly staff. Pool was never crouded, breakfast ok and room good. Location was great and we did not mind walking/excercising some steps up from the metro up to the hotel. No noise from traffic. Only critics: coffee in the room (nespresso) was much better that the coffee served for breakfast. And tea should be made from leaves - not with a teabag.",5
Serenity in the middle of bustling city,frenchyBrisbane,"We recently stayed at Fort Canning for 2 nights and will definitely make it our stopover hotel in the future. It s location is ideal, so close to the MRT, Orchard road, Clarck quay... The fact that it is in the middle of the park is great, it really does give a sense of serenity in what is a busy city. Go through the spice gardens, watch people doing tai chi in the morning... Room was great, had a lovely feel to it, the pod coffee machine is a nice touch, comfy bed, clean room Breakfast was also good with a mix of european and Asian dishes, fresh eggs cooked to your liking as well as pancakes. Staff was very friendly specially the older gentleman at breakfast. We have stayed in Marina Bay Area the last two times we were in Singapore in those monstrous hotel where you just feel…",5
"Hotel Fort Canning, Singapore",Simon555-2014,"Hotel Fort Canning is a colonial style building which dates to the 1920s and it was built and used by the British Army and has been used by the British, Japanese, during WW2, and Singapore military are a HQ of staff college. Today it is a boutique hotel that exudes an ‘old world’ quality and charm. It is located in Fort Canning which is both central to Singapore and secluded from the usual hectic life of the city. The hotel rooms are ‘high tech’ with digital controls for the lights, blinds and air conditioning – which take getting used to – and they are of a high quality and are very comfortable. The rooms are large and designed to be very open and uncluttered – some people might prefer a less eccentric style which included a sitting area but I feel that most people will come to…",4
Great service,huang101,"I recently stayed at this hotel for the last four days of our SE Asia holiday.  It was a great refuge from the hustle and bustle of big city life.  The hotel is located on the edge of the Fort Canning Park, next to the Singapore National Museum and close to the Dhoby Gaut MRT station.  A little confusing for taxi drivers to get to the hotel, and took a while to figure out the fastest way to the MRT.  Quickest route to MRT would be through the parking lot elevator to basement level one and over to the Park Center Mall parking garage.  Take the elevator or the stairs from the 4th floot to the second floor and the out the front door to the Dhouby Gaut station.  About 5 minutes walk, 10 minutes if you go around the mall.  The hotel room was very clean with high ceilings and great…",5
Nature in the city,Ansar R,"Stayed here for a night. Greeted by front desk in-charge Julian. He was really fast in checking us in. Brought us up to the room and showed the ammenities around. Requests made were fufilled in an instant. The room was really nice. Clean and well kept. Really impressed by the comfort too. The big windows gave a really nice view of the park.   The pool was nice. Only spent time in the free form pool though.Word of caution, Singapore is a tropical city and HFC is surrounded by really nice big trees and nature. So chilling by the pool will make you a sittting target for the mosquitos. Pack an insect repellent.  The hotel near to Dhoby Ghaut MRT which is along and close to the main train lines. A short walk of maybe 10 mins from the train station to the hotel. However walking to the…",5
"Great location, good hotel",Porpententious,"This hotel is situated inside Fort Canning Park which means that it feels far removed from the noise of the city - but you are really only a few minutes walk away. So full marks for the location if you are looking for something a little different in Singapore.  My room included a lovely outdoor terrace area, which unfortunately couldn't be used due to the rain. As for the bath in the middle of the room, which seems to be latest fashion, no thanks. And especially in this case where it meant that the room felt very crowded as a result of The Dominating Bathtub.  The fitness center has limited hours, opening late and closing early, especially on the weekends which seems rather odd given how large it is.   Service was very good with check-in and check-out happening smoothly. I was…",4
Great Setting,Chris C,"Spent an enjoyable week in Singapore at this hotel.  Its location - within a parkland setting, its old world charm - being the pre war British military HQ, the friendliness and the helpful nature of staff, and its proximity to the MRT made it an excellent choice for us.  We would definitely stay here again.",5
"Enjoyable stay, quiet, and comfortable",Timbo54,"Stayed twice in October/November 2014 as we were attending a wedding at the Armenian church nearby, so it was for us an ideal location. Chose to pay a bit more for a premium room with the bathrom inside and a small sitting area by the window, which we preferred to the rooms with bathroom by the window. Room on the third floor overlooked the green embankment of the park, not a great view and certainly the city view rooms have (in my opinion) a better view but I don't think there are any premium rooms on that side of the hotel. Check-in was easy and efficient and we were shown to our rooms very quickly.   The room was clean, and a reasonable size with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. there was a safe, minibar and tea & coffee making facilities plus we received 2 bottles of…",4
Lacking soul,Victoria K,"We stayed one night at the fort canning hotel in october,the situation is quiet and our room over looked the green lush jungle park. The actual building has promise however the dark green carpet starkly white painted walls and lack of ambience generally will not prompt a repeat stay. The room was small. Far too many electronic gadgets for apeaceful skeep the room was buzzing with electro magnetic radaition The bathroom could be seen by joggers opposite on jingle jogging track so we needed to close the blinds wach time we used the bathroom.

A nice Hotel with great staff,255060Ian,"My wife and I had a Premium room overlooking the park on the Hotel entrance side. The park itself is lush and green and a very pleasant place to enjoy a relaxing walk. Our room, and the Hotel in general were top notch. The room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. The Hotel staff were excellent and they even put on a happy Hour every evening with some very nice wine, champagne, and canapés. It's an easy five minute walk to a major shopping complex and the MRT (Subway) station, and the Hotel is also fairly close to both Clarke and Robertson Quays. Highly recommended!",5
Beautiful.,KHOON MIN L,"So nice to have this hotel in the middle of a bustling city. The view from the room was great. Green and lush. And the sounds of the morning... crickets and butterflies. The hi-tech bedroom, electronically wired up for convenience, made the stay so memorable. Breakfast was good, so was the service. A very good staycation experience. We checked out on Saturday 8 Nov... quite reluctantly.",4
A Peaceful Retreat,Julie Barclay,Lovely peaceful setting in Fort Canning Park away from the hustle and bustle. Excellent staff. Modern bathroom with huge baths and walk in showers. The daily happy hour from 6pm with free wine and canapes is a lovely touch. Very close to Orchard Road ( 10 min walk ) and the local MRT ( underground) which means you can get around very easily. Will definitely stay here again.,5
A dream of beauty and hospitality....,happy9710,"We were welcomed as if we were friends. We were treated as if we were royalty. And we enjoyed the beautiful room, the pol, the dining at the various restaurants and the room service.

We love the Hotel Fort Canning also for the polite, atentive, quality service.",5

A Memorable Staycation,vinylglasses,"For our anniversary, my fiancé and I booked a room at Hotel Fort Canning and was pleasantly surprised by the thoughtful note that the staff had left behind in the room. The hotel is filled with both traditional and modern vibes, that makes it different from the lot. What I liked best about this hotel was the bedroom and the bath that makes me wish my home looks just like that. Upon entering the room, a big comfy bed sits in the middle of the modern chic room. Not too far from it, is a full swung bathroom door that opens up to a clean-looking, light-gray marbled bathroom, complete with a free-standing bathroom perfect for a soak. There were various spots in the room that definitely shows much thoughtful thinking was put into the design process. Arguably one of the best designed…",4
Better options elsewhere,BeesonFamily,"Unfortunately for the Fort Canning Hotel we had a fairly significant reservation issue which was very disappointing and remained unresolved.  This has impacted the rating we have given this otherwise entirely acceptable 4 star hotel.   We made our reservation with booking.com and indicted that the reservation was for 3 guests, myself, my husband and our four year old son.  At no stage were we advised that we would be sharing a bed with our son.  Neither the hotel or booking.com saw fit to ask us if this was acceptable.  What we later learnt was that the hotel does not provide rollaway beds (they claim there is not enough room in the rooms which is rubbish) and that despite us not having a bed for our son our full  payment made upon booking was 100% non-refundable in the event of…",3
2nd staycation,Iceshadow,"For my 2nd staycation at HFC I decided to take a premium room instead of the regular deluxe room.  Firstly the location of the hotel is quite unique.  It's the only hotel located in a National Park.  Getting there however can be interesting.  If you are getting there via public transport, get off at the Dhoby Ghaut station and walk towards Parkmall shopping centre.  There take the lift to the 4th floor and exit via the carpark towards the park.  The hotel is just ahead.  The room I was given was on the 2nd floor and faced the park on the rear side of the building.  Check-in was smooth fast and efficient and within 15 minutes I was in my room.  The premium room is separated into 3 different sections, the main bedroom area, a small enclosed balcony area where the desk and the…",4

Very unique hotel,travelling_too2,"This hotel is quite unique.  We have visited Singapore numerous times over the last 20 years and picked this hotel due to its location, facilities and uniqueness (we stayed 4 nights).  It is located close to the MRT and within Fort Canning Park, so is a good location handy to transport and yet has a relaxing feel being in a park setting.   The staff were very helpful and pleasant. Our room was very nice with quite a unique bathroom in that it’s built within the old heritage verdandah.  Room had excellent facilities, was very comfortable and I liked the fact that the hotel provides TWG teas in the rooms!

Very relaxing staycation at HFC,sabretooth1975,"We stayed between 10-12 October for my wife's birthday.  From arrival to departure, we were made to feel welcomed by all of the staff.

Historic charm in need of a spruce up,ToineWester,"These former British army headquarters have been transformed into a charming hotel in a great central location. The Fort Canning Park is literally just a few steps away from the front door, and Orchard Road and Boat Quay are within easy walking distance. Much effort has gone into preserving the historic character of the building; the rooms are on the small side but very comfortable. The general decor could do with a bit of attention though, and it's a pity that the great white tent intended for wedding venues seems to be a permanent fixture in the garden. The bar which is the focal point in the grand room with the staircase is permanently dark during the day, with no bar staff on duty. One of the services that requires immediate attention is the poor internet connectivity in the…",3
Great place to stay,Marisa F,"Wonderful hotel. Made to feel special from beginning to end. Beautiful park setting, excellent location, Central but away from hassle and bustle.

Green Oasis,jab050,"This hotel's best feature is its location in Fort Canning Park, an oasis of greenery in Singapore. It is walking distance to Orchard  Road and Dhoby Ghaut stations and a 20 minute stroll to Serangoon Road.  We booked the  room with attached garden and this was probably a mistake as although the garden is lovely, the room is bizarre.  It has a giant bed and a bathtub in the middle of the room, and the shower and toilet are in a sort of wardrobe with a sliding door.  The room allowed for the toilet is so small that my knees could not fit. On the weekend it was quite noisy as there is a function centre at the hotel. There are two very clean pools but the hotel needs to provide more shade and to make sure a supply of towels is maintained.  We did have a problem with staff randomly…",4
Nice but missed the mark on expectations,lifeoftravel,"I wanted to LOVE this hotel. I had a friend that was here for a conference - and I can see why as a conference delegate she loved it. Unfortunately it was post a long weekend holiday in Singapore and it was VERY quiet. At times I thought I was the only person in the hotel. No-one at entrance on arrival most times, corridors quiet, pool to myself... anyway - the room was nice. I loved the bathroom - marble and lovely outlook with big bath. However, I had major problems with water pressure (disappeared to nothing but a boiling hot trickle multiple times) and the shower didn't drain. I reported and was told it would be attended to right away. Sadly the same issue was still there after that. I felt that whilst this isn't the most exxy hotel in Singapore, it still commands a decent…",3
This hotel is something else.,Greycalli,"We stayed at this hotel from 1 till 3 October and we cannot speak highly enough of this place. Set in a green oasis less than 5 minutes walk to Orchard road the rooms were lovely and well presented. The staff was extremely helpful at all times with the questions we had for them.The room was extremely quiet and we enjoyed good nights sleep. One desk staff in particular explained a quick and convenient way to Orchard Rd and given it was mid evening the first time we went it was much appreciated. We are regular visitors to Singapore on the way to UK and Canada and as a result have stayed in a variety of hotels,we now have our regular hotel, neither my wife or myself have any desire to stay elsewhere. Set just below the original Fort Canning  it is in a significant historical area.",5

Nice fabulous staycation!,dav12lim,"Get to stay in Hotel Fort Canning got 1 night on 4-5 Oct 2014. Initially we have booked a Deluxe room, during check-in was told that Deluxe was all taken up (partly because I made the booking only 2 days earlier), and offered me a free upgrade to their Premium Room! So happy!!!  Premium room is so spacious, has a living room, spacious bathroom, 2 big windows with remote control blinders. King size bed is so comfortable. Staffs are very polite and helpful. Always giving a smile. Located within city area, but yet hide away in the greenery Fort Canning hill, this hotel is definitely worth a stay if you like to be within minutes of Orchard but yet want so quietness!  I will definitely come back again in future!",5
Perfection,Michael T,"Hotel Fort Canning had always been a favourite of ours, not only for its lush surrounds, luxurious rooms and convenient location, we were spoilt rotten with its impeccable customer service, the kind you only get with a boutique hotel.   In fact we love it so much we thought twice about writing this review, hoping to keep this wonderful secret.   The key point of difference for HFC was the thoughtful and prompt service we got from its lovely staff. A true testament to this was with our recent stay, specifically chosen for its wow factor for our guest flying in for our wedding at Fort Canning park. The hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate our larger than life relatives, a cute 3mth old and well yes, us as about to get married couples. No doubt all the thoughtful and…",5
Simple luv e deep soaking bathtub..,JusToh75,"Our family had a very wonderful 1 night stay @ HFC on 06~07 Sep, 2014 (Sat~Sun).

Next trilling part of the hotel room was the ""deep soaking bathtub"", it was also e very 1st time we ever met a hotel whom had such a ""HUGE"" bathtub which could allow the 3 of us to soak in it & had our relaxing bubble-bath !! Coming to the outdoor area, the hotel was equipped with 2 swimming pools & 1 Children's pool.

The hotel is itself is a boutique style hotel with excellent service. If you're after the glitzy five star large hotel this is not the place for you but if you like a smaller boutique style accommodation with tasteful rooms and staff that call you by name then I highly recommend Hotel Fort Canning.  The rooms have been tastefully redecorated with modern touches such as computer TV, touch pad control lighting and electric blinds.

Wow !! Fabulous Singapore Style.,Thomas S,"Let me start by saying I have only ever stayed in Singapore on brief stopovers at high rise hotels in Singapore. Not really the best way to discover such an incredible city. I chose Fort Canning Hotel because it was a small boutique  , niche market hotel , not the run of the mill corporate style hotels with hundreds of rooms and little heart and style ( soul) . On arriving we were greeted by a young man who couldn't have been more helpful at check in , our designated room had a few glitches which he immeadiatly responded to by showing us three other room for us to choose from.

The hotel decor and immediate surrounds and grounds including pool areas are exceptional . The hotel is set in acres of parkland that provide a peaceful tranquil atmosphere and is short walking distance from the MRT line or Clarke Quay. Who would know you were in the heart of the city. Hotel Fort Canning did not disappoint on our second time around :) Thank you for an enjoyable stay once again.,5

The pools are filtered using NASA technology for water filtration & temperature control (soft water with no chlorine or salt required).... just beautiful to swim in!  6th canapés & wine; good before dinner at their classy east/west fusion restaurant.

I almost wet when I was right in the lobby. Then, I go to have my breakfast at glasshouse restaurant inside the hotel. Service was nice and restaurant atmosphere is good. What I want to recommend is the food taste, noodle was not OK. My friend took omelette and it just can eatable and she was not enjoy much about the taste with 35 SGD breakfast (17%service charge and tax not included)  For me, the soup and western breakfast was OK.

"Trendy and chic, but lack of labeling and signage can be challenging",BNisen,"Summary: This is undoubtedly a beautiful location for a wedding or event. It’s also quiet and serene for an overnight stay.

Pros: Beautiful location (the hotel lobby even smells like rose petals or something!) Serene and quiet Pleasant staff, although sometimes uninformed (although I do think this is something they are working on)  Cons: Room is always humid – even with air conditioning on.

Mixed Emotions,zaubererpferd,Stayed here for 4 days for business. There is a gap between hard ware and soft ware in this place. Rooms are modern and well equiped. Good sleeping quality aprt from ac which is a little bit noisy. Good restaurtant and some dishes a good value for money which is difficult to find in Singapore. Staff is a different story. It was hard to find a person when I checked in close to midnight (have to look after by luggage by myself) When I checked out I tried to make a reservation for the coming week. It was not possible. Receptionist told me to use the web site to find out wether a booking under what condition might be possible (rather strange I found this).,3

On my second visit recently, I chose to spend some quiet 'me' time in the Deluxe Garden/ Patio Room. I was not disappointed with the lovely room set-up, service and facilities. Abigail, the front-desk officer helped me to check-in to my room and gave me a brief orientation of the room before leaving me for some quiet moment with myself. It had a spacious king size bed, writing desk, complimentary Nespresso / TWG tea (for caffeine addicts), etc. A lovely pair of French doors swung open to gain you entry to its spacious patio/ garden area.

Room service food is delicious, if you are too tired to go out, and although we didn't have breakfast this time, on our last visit breakfast was good and the staff delightful. This time the hotel slid in my estimation because housekeeping let the hotel down. We had to ask front desk to send housekeeping back to re-clean our room.

Tranquillity base in bustling Singapore,JOHN L,"I have been to Singapore many times in the past and have always stayed in one of the skyscraper international chain hotels (e.g Pan Pacific, Mandarin Oriental etc) but when my recent booking search indicated that my first choices had no available rooms, a web search brought up Hotel Fort Canning. First impressions seemed positive, so I took a chance and booked a room. It was without doubt one of the smartest moves I have ever made! Hotel Fort Canning is a stunning, colonial-style building set in the green and lush surroundings of Fort Canning Park.

Great Hotel near the city center,Frankymann,"Hotel Fort Canning is place in a park, near Clare Quay. The hotel is just excellent, the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and tidy. Interesting setup was the bathroom, separated from the bedroom by a glas wall. The whole bathroom was held in marble. Wow. In the room we had free WiFi, good quality. The pools invite for relaxing after the usage of the hotel gym which is properly locked after. The distance to restaurants and shops is big enough to have quiet and peace from the city but close enough for a walk. I fully recommend this hotel, would stay there again!",5
Perfect getaway,Stef S,"I booked the premium King for my solo getaway and it was perfect. Tranquil views and peaceful setting. The ceiling was very high and the nook with the desk and comfy egg like sofa felt precious and lovely.  Swimming pools were full lengths and quite empty which meant I got to swim and splash for a jolly long time alone.  Food however was only ok. The local selection was delicious but the steak I ordered had a fishy taste which meant that it was prepared w a fish dish and tasted like it was frozen meat. I wish there was another option for food with good Italian fare or even dimsum, that would have made it perfect for me.",4
Travelling with elderly mother?,Mevster,"I escorted my 87 year old mother on her first overseas trip from Australia. The setting of the hotel was the major draw card and I was NOT disappointed.   The hotel is out of the Singapore hustle and bustle but close enough to walk to nearby attractions - yes even for an 87 year old. The staff were very helpful and responded to all my requests promptly and with a smile - anything from calling a Taxi, extra tea bags, booking tours.   All our evening meals and breakfasts were had in the Glasshouse Restaurant.  There for seven days and did not get bored with the menu at all.  And breakfast - best omelet in my life!  The staff, Gangga, Grace, Eden and the breakfast chef (sorry- don't have name) made my mother and myself feel very welcome.  They were always very helpful and attentive…",4
A disappointment in many ways!,Miriam H,"We chose Fort Canning Park because of its location and the old colonial building it is situated in. First of all : The location is great : Many places can be reached by foot (Orchard Road on one side of the park, the river bank, marina and Esplanade on the other – even Bugis or the Raffles hotel are within walking distance. The park is quite big and absolutely beautiful for jogging, an evening stroll or some quiet time with a book. Try out the spice garden ; you’ll learn a lot !  Regarding the hotel we were disappointed. The beautiful old building is over-renovated with cheap design that already looks somewhat run down. We booked a patio room on the first floor. The patio is a strip of an outside platform simply separated with some potted plants – not much privacy here, but with…",2
The worsest hotel I ever stayed,John M,"Got used to stay in luxury 5 star hotel and was sure that hotel with such a great history won`t dissapoint me but I spent 2 hours while checking-in, then I can`t get back my deposit via credit card for more than 1 month which never happened to me, then personel - rude, slow, absolutaly not willing to work, food - 3 star maximum, very few choise and bad quality. Room - old and strange. There are lots of nice hotels in Singapore so I will never stay here again.",1
Fort  Canning Hotel,spender49,This was a very pleasant hotel & the staff were kind & helpful..... BUT be warned they do over book & we were told... not asked... to move out for a couple of days as they had an Estee Lauder conference booked-we refused and all was well -- but some guests  could not book in and had to go elsewhere. The hotel is set in tropical gardens where we could enjoy a peaceful walk. The hotel was ideally situated  as near  Dhoby Ghat Metro and a shopping Plaza. The food in the restaurant was very good and the service was good . The room was spacious and well appointed. We were on the second floor and just along from the entrance to the pools. Overall a pleasant stay.,4
MUST STAY HOTEL IN SINGAPORE,SporeSlave,"I enjoyed my staycation at the Hotel Fort Canning. It’s a walking distance from Dhoby Ghaut MRT. Its direct as there are clear directional signage to guide me all the way to hotel lobby. When I first step in, I super like the feel and smell. Quiet and clean hotel. Approach the hotel reception to check-in and the customer service personnel is very polite and wears a smile at all times. I glance around and realise that all their staffs are very customer oriented. Pretty fast done with the check-in, and their staff brought us up to our rooms. The room is exactly what I saw online (usually I will minus my expectation of 50% so that I know I won’t feel so cheated when I see the actual room) – best accommodation room amenities. The hotel uses HD TV screens and their programmes…",5
Great stay with impeccable service,ClydeCheng,"Stayed at Hotel Fort Canning for a weekend staycation and it was such a great experience. The rooms were nice and comfortable and I loved the bathroom and the tub.  What's great is that the hotel is just minutes away from Dhouby Ghaut yet when I was in the hotel, I was away from all the crowd of Orchard road. It's a great feeling.  The service provided by the staff was impeccable. I had the pleasure of being served by Abigail and her team, and it totally made my stay. From the check-in, to room service, to every little request that was made and met, all with a smile and can-do attitude.   Highly recommend this place, and I do look forward to staying with them again.",5
A Great stay from 18/07 - 20/07/14,ZM,"Had a 3 day 2 night staycation recently at Fort Canning. Stayed in the hotel for the 2nd time and we chose the Deluxe Garden Room, 1st floor (the last time we chose the Deluxe Room, 2nd floor).   Atmosphere of the place is fantastic, every night we had a wonderful sleep and even in the day, the room is so cozy it took me and my partner a lot of effort to make ourselves walk out of the room. The only down side was that the outdoor garden was a little run down with the sundecks covered in stains as well.  Again, the service in the hotel is top notch, for both nights, everything was in order and the toiletries were replenished even though the first batch of toiletries were not completely used up. The staff were even able to assist me in purchasing a bouquet of roses in the night…",4
The Worst Run Luxury Hotel in Singapore - don't waste your time here,"Chris J ""Mohawk"" Reed","  It started badly and got worse. It should have been so good, they have a wonderful building in Fort Canning Park, near Orchard Road but if you have no food, no wine, no brunch, no cafe and no staff then you're onto a loser immediately. Don't waste your time here there a million better hotels to stay at in Singapore.  We stayed here for a staycation as we do in many hotels on Singapore so have some experience of the great and the bad hotels of Singaore. This was one of the worst.  When booking they didn't confirm that their acclainmed Italian restaurant which did a great brunch and supplied all the wines and food for the lounge had in fact closed down until it was too late to find somewhere else and when we arrived this restaurant still has it's bottles of champagne and wine in…",1
"Lovely building, great service, ask about hot water",DougJ25,"I stayed here for a work conference in July 2014.    Overall, I give the service 5 stars, which includes every member of the staff from the front desk, to the restaurant, to the cleaning staff.  The room was relatively well appointed.  I had room 212 which faced the entrance.   I had two complaints: the water in the shower wasn't hot, but it turns out the trick is to turn the handle in the shower the opposite way you think it should work.   Several other work colleagues complained about the lack of hot water so if your room doesn't have hot water in the shower, ask for someone to come to the room and test it (I did).   The other complaint was that the bathroom sink did not drain quickly which made it hard to use it.  Singapore is hot and humid and it was difficult to feel…",4
Very bad service,UnhappyHFC,"Overall, a bad value and worse ever service I have experienced in Singapore. I stayed in HFC for 5 nights in end of July 2014 for a business meeting. I had many terrible experience, the staff is very experienced. Every day room cleaning had different problem - one day there was no water in the room, next day no towels at all, third day no coffee / tea.   Hotel isn't designed for business customers as they only 3 (yes 3) hangers to hand my week of suites and shirts!!!   And internet speed is slower than a dial-up account.  What a shame as it is beautiful building and very nice location.",1
Great stay!!,Roslyn N,"We stayed in Fort Canning at the beginning of June for 5 days in one of their garden courtyard rooms. The room was very comfortable and clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. the reception desk staff helped us daily with any enquires we had regarding tours or directions. Breakfast was great with a large variety of food to choose from. Location of the hotel was great, next to the park and away from central Singapore so it was very quiet.Would recommend this hotel.",4
As good as it gets for business travel,HoustonTravel4,"I stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip to our office in Singapore. It is a superb location, very private and a bit of an oasis in a city state which is quite densely populated.  I arrived very late or probably more precisely very early in the morning and the welcome was warm and genuine and no hassle, which is much appreciated after 24+ hours of travel.  The room was superb, and probably the best shower I ever had, an almost essential to revive you after all that time imprisoned in a pressurized flying tube, or airplane :)  Close to good restaurants and of. Of course nowhere is far away in Singapore. Travel advice, make sure you have Sing Dollars, SGD, for the taxi. In autopilot, I did not and had the US view that a credit card was ""the norm"", if is not and the hotel…",5
Perfect city hotel with gorgeous surroundings,865Shar0n_P,"Husband and I finally had the chance to holiday without the kids and we loved every minute. Hotel Fort Canning lived up to expectations from the moment we arrived. Courteous staff who went out of their way to help us, gorgeous room with a city view as well.  Location was perfect - walked through lovely gardens to the MRT train station and a huge shopping mall with heaps of food options. Also really close to Clarke Quay, fabulous for bars and restaurants. Taxis were cheap if you needed to get to the other side of town and were always available quickly through the concierge. Our Room was gorgeous, modern and clean.

On arrival it feels like a building charming old building that boosts gorgeous amenities...this experience was upheld. The staff really go out of their way to help you. Highlights having one of the team assist me re packing my bags so I didn't waste precious time on my business trip. A+ plus for attitude. Helping with my bill and generally trying hard to give a guest a good experience.  If I had to find a fault the service at the pool bar is via phone and once served excellent however a little more presence to clear away after the meal/drinks are served (albeit was a very hot day) could have resulted in a top score there too.

We found a great alternative with a similar level of comfort in Hotel Fort Canning - and much more affordable. It met all our expectations, even surpassed them.  The lovely lady who checked us in also escorted us to our room...a nice personal touch. Our room was immaculately clean, well-designed, not overly large but the high ceilings, ample storage and that magnificent picture window in the bathroom more than made up for the size. This bathroom, with its view out to the city, was simply gorgeous. We were on the top floor so no need to close the blinds (I think!)

A Very Special Hotel,rosecrystal,I spent 10 nights in this lovely Hotel from the 30th May to the 9th June. The reception staff are very helpful and genuinely interested in making your stay as pleasant as possible. The breakfast is superb and highly recommended. Omelettes will be freshly cooked for you and also pancakes with maple syrup which are delicious. The restaurant staff are very attentive and cannot do enough for you. Their manners are impeccable.  The complimentary cocktails and canapés from 6pm - 7pm are a very nice touch. Just a couple of small negatives: There is a definite smell when coming out of the lift and walking across the third floor to the bedrooms. I was in Room 327 and the grouting all along the base of the shower cubicle was black with mould. The air conditioning is very noisy and…,5
Hotel on the hill,Wet-dog-123,"Hotel is in a park on a hill in the centre of Singapore. It is well placed with a short walk to the Dhoby Gault MRT underground in one direction and Clarke Quay in the other direction.

You can leave your bags secure and go explore or head for the pool if you just want to relax, all without paying for early check in. The hotel is clean and the rooms large and well designed with all the usually, such as safe . Breakfast is self serve and has all you would expect and want from a hotel with international clientele .

Very bad value,elfish,"My husband arranged for us to stay at this hotel for our anniversary.  We had read good reviews but we're very disappointed for the very high price that we paid for the room. The rooms are not sound proof, over priced coffee and drinks, run down gym and change rooms, and there weren't even robes to use in the room. I have no idea how this is called a 5 star hotel. There are much, much better hotels for a lot less money in Singapore.",2
Beautiful hotel but bad practices.,Joyce W,"This was a repeat visit to the hotel as my first stay in the suite was very much pleasant and enjoyable.   Abigail, in the front office did an excellent job checking me in despite the late check-in and delays in releasing the room.   Everything turned out well only after I checked out, I was astounded by the hotel's billing practices.   As it is a standard practice for hotels to charge all outstanding bills upon check out, I was astounded when I received an email of an additional charged to my card. The hotel simply charged my card without my consent and sent me a scanned copy of the receipt a couple of hours later.   Without a phone call or any consent on my end, they charged my card a few hours after I checked- out. It was very unprofessional for them.   The person whom…",2
Fort Awesome,Michael T,"After our previous hotel was a bit of a dive the Hotel Fort Canning well and truly made up for it.  If you are fond of old colonial buildings, history and want a good stay check out this hotel.  Pros: The hotel has installed modern decor and amenities in a beautiful colonial building.  The rooms are small but well lit, airy and functional.  On top of that the hotel is surrounded by the fort canning gardens which make you feel like you are staying in a botanical garden.  If you are a jogger the park has some good hills to push yourself on or if you are not keen to run outside in Singapore's humid weather there are 2 pools, and an awesome gym.  The rooms, meals and service was as you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Cons: The dining are for breakfast was a bit cramped.  Reading…",5
as we find it,dubaimadge,"Currently staying here, so thought I'd review as we go. Beautiful park like setting, pool areas look good, bar prices, high. Worst things so far is that there is an unpleasant musty smell everywhere including our room, may splash out on an aromatic candle today. We're in a bigger room, but the lay out is awful, bed's in the centre of the room surrounded by wasted space. Bed is very comfortable with decent bedding. The premium toiletries are generic, and not very nice, again will go and buy my own today. The room has tons of mirrors and the naturally dark room's lighting is not very pleasant. Haven't figured out where to dry my hair yet, plugs don't appear to align with mirrors!  Plan to write a further reviews.  ",3
"Quirky, characterful but flawed",1Tough_customer,"Stayed here in June on business.  The hotel's location is not particularly convenient and the lobby/entrance proved a struggle for my tax driver to access (poor signage).  Once inside check-in formalities were taken care of with minimum fuss and staff were at all times helpful and thoughtful.  There was an overpowering aroma in the lobby which I find very off-putting.  I was allocated one of the end rooms which was sizeable and well appointed.  However two fittings came apart in my hands (a strip light inside the wardrobe and then the tap in shower).  To be fair these were swiftly attended to while I was out of the hotel, but it does raise questions about the quality of fittings.  Controls for lights and air con were also a victory of style over substance; I would have slept…",3
Soo relaxing...,WellTravelled1892,"Beautiful colonial style building, surrounded by greenery, creating an oasis in the middle of a busy city. We loved our room and really enjoyed breakfast, although we thought the range of food was limited. The staff on duty in The Glasshouse were very attentive and looked after us like an aunt or uncle you haven’t seen for years. One little gripe, with one exception in Little India, every time we’ve stayed in a Singapore hotel they’ve been quite stingy with the toiletries and this was true here too. We actually ran out of toilet paper at a very inconvenient moment! Please put two toilet rolls in the bathroom! Watch when booking on the website that rhymes with pagoda. On HFC’s website it clearly reads, “Aperitif Hour from 6pm to 7pm. Complimentary for all hotel room guests only.”…",4

Fantastic Holiday away from the Busy Singapore city,hotelking85,"Decided to stay one night at the hotel over the weekend, just to get away from the busy city life of Singapore. Very nice location with lushest trees surround the property, really felt as if we have left Singapore. Check in was smooth. The first room that I was provided has a musty smell, the staff promptly switched me to another room which felt much better. The city view room was nice. Rooms are clean and decorated with very modern furniture and fixtures. The evening drinks was a nice surprise considering they provided a good selection of alcohol for free. The pool was well maintained, I really like the use of non-chlorine treatment system for the pools.Overall the service, facilities and room was fantastic. Highly recommended hotel in Singapore.",5

We had a lovely late dinner in our room and a delightful lunch in the restaurant. The location was great, a peaceful location, great for walks to explore all the historical aspects of the fort with beautiful gardens and walking tracks and there was also a fully equipped gym.

Good staycation experience but there is room for improvements,gayeonx,"Fuss free check-in and check-out. Our deluxe room on 3rd floor was spacious and clean. The bathroom was exceptionally lovely.  I’m not sure if the hotel preferred a tad of old and rustic touch because the hotel was formally a colonial building. There was a slight lack of maintenance and cleanliness at the exterior area of the hotel.  We had the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on when we went out for dinner. When we came back from dinner, we saw a lovely cake on the writing desk from the hotel for my birthday. As much as we appreciate the lovely and kind gesture, we don’t appreciate the fact that the hotel staff entered our empty room despite us having the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on.

If you want a harder workout, there's plenty of stair climbing for you.

Staff are friendly especially those at the concierge and bell service. Those at the breakfast though, uhmn, maybe they should be more energetic and enthusiastic, to say the least.  Food though is something else. Its bland. Although this may be due to the poor choice of conference organizers.

We didn't have breakfast included in our stay which ended up being a good thing as we slept till about 11am every morning thanks to the jet-lag! The hotel is in the best location for walking around Singapore or using the trains or buses. We were able to walk to and from the local train station within 5 - 7 minutes as well as the bus station from which many buses depart to various areas. We were also able to walk to Orchard Road very quickly and easily.  Also within walking distance to Clarke Quay which was great for dinners and drinks in the evenings.

I wish there was a rating between average and very good ...,VenturerSydney,"It was very hard for me to decide on the exact rating to give this hotel. On the one hand, it is probably better than 'average.' On the other, giving it a higher ranking would imply a recommendation to future travellers when I have reservations about that.  So, on to the good and the less impressive:   The good: - the rooms are lovely. We had a premium luxe room which was thoughtfully set out and was enough space for us and our son. The amenities in the room were great and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in - the park surroundings gave the hotel a tranquil vibe away from the hustle and bustle - the room service. On our first night, we had dinner in our room as we arrived very late. For room service food it was exceptional. We went for the local rice…",3
A Serene Boutique Hotel in the City,Laksh85,"Stayed here twice with my wife.  Once in a premium room and another time in a premium luxe room.  Rooms were clean and spacious.  Modern amenities like Nespresso machines and I-pod docking stations are available.  Electronic blinds, air conditioning system and room lighting can be controlled using a bedside touch control pad or the television.  Tried their room service and it wasn't bad. Ordered sandwich which came with salad and fries and the portions were huge. The hotel spa is not bad too. Staffs were efficient and friendly.  Overall,  it's a wise choice if you're planning to stay in the city without the inevitable hustle and bustle. ",4
"A nice hotel, but there is better in Singapore",Gorbylicious,"We stayed here for 2 nights on a stopover on our way to Bali. Having visited Singapore in the past I have always been impressed by the standard of hospitality and quality of hotels in the city area. Fort Canning Hotel is situated on a large parkland site hosted in an historical building that is aesthetically impressive in its bold stature upon a hill in a comparatively remote area of Central Singapore. The grounds are vast and house many points of interest such as museums and national archives. It is a short walk to the quay and within reasonable walking distance to orchard road. However, the humidity and the geography of the hotel within the park can make this a little awkward and taxis are recommended to make this more manageable for getting around generally. The standard…",3
"Nice Hotel, Kind Staffs",JudyMOK,"My family (2 kids, they are 1 & 3 years old) stayed in HFC (Hotel Fort Canning) from 28~31 Mar 2014.  We checked in at about 2200 and we just took few minutes to finish the check in process. The staff promptly arrange the room to us.   It is the room in G/F. It is very nice & cozy. My 3 years old son loved the easy chair very much!  The staffs in GlassHouse Restaurant were very friendly and helpful to my little guys!  The pool is comfortable and user friendly for family like us.   The Taxi calling services is very efficient.   Will stay again in HFC next time to Singapore!",4
Could be SO much better,Nick G,"This hotel is in a charming old building, well restored, located in the middle of a lovely green park, yet just a couple of hundred meters away from the hustle & bustle of Orchard Road and central Singapore.   But that's where the positive review ends I'm afraid.   I stay in hotels probably about 50 weeks a years, so I'd like tit in, that I have a reasonable sense for what is a good hotel, and what is not. Hotel Fort Canning isn't bad, but it's certainly not good. It lacks that ""something"" that makes good hotels good.   It's also certainly not a boutique hotel. They are typically small, intimate, maybe a little quirky and invariably give great service. Hotel Fort Canning is none of those.   Service beyond the front desk is very disappointing. Knowledge of the staff often…",3
Vacation,Ruonanoja,"We stayed at the hotel 5 nights. From the point of arrival we felt more than welcome to this hotel. Service was excellent all the time and staff really polite and helpful.  Room was nice, well equiped and comfortable despite the fact that in the first floor you could hear every morning when laundry service car will arrive at 7 am when you are located in the corner room. Location is excellent. Short walking distance to city center and the nearest MRT station. We enjoying time in the pool you really don't feel that you are in the middle of big city. Place for improvement is cleaning which level varied a bit during the week. Guest rooms were handled well but fitted carpets in the hallways would require vacuuming. Overall very pleasant vacation in Singapore and Hotel Fort Canning.",5
Great Boutique Hotel in a Park - hard to beat it.,colinspain,"We had always stayed in the city, but this little boutique hotel is a must for a relaxing stay in this busy city.  The Hotel Fort Canning is our choice from now on, as the location setting in a large park is so inviting.  Still close to the MRT, you can walk around the park before breakfast and wonder where all the Singapore residents are.  The Glasshouse Restaurant is a great place for breakfast and the rooms have modern fittings in a vintage decor.  We will be back!",5
a hidden gem!,Nazhan,"Last Dec 2013, I booked 2 nights staycation for me and my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. A really good hotel for a romantic getaway. Staff was polite and helpful. Hotel was really clean. It had an awesome rustic ambience. Loved the idea of the hotel was one of Singapore's pre-historic building which they cleverly converted into a small hotel. The concept of the rooms are really unique. Our bathroom is located where usually a hotel's balcony would normally be. Really cool.   To get a nearest mall or train you will need to walk out because the hotel is nestled within Fort Canning Park. Be prepared to do some stair climbing as you will need to climb a few flight of stairs to get to the hotel when you are coming back from all that shopping.  But we love to take walks so…",4
Pleasantly surprised,markus f,"Stayed here as stay-cation for 1 night.  Our entry level room (deluxe) on level 3 gave a feeling it was quite large, perhaps due to the high ceiling.  Bathroom was well appointed. Bedding and pillows were good. Slept like a charm.  TV good as well and allowed easy connecting to my players HDMI cable.  Room came with use of ""cocktail hour"". Nothing special there as it consisted of almost no food, white, red and bubbly wine. Nice to sit outside though while sipping on wine. Quite relaxing.  Building is a heritage building, giving a nice and unique touch to most things in and around the building.  Breakfast has limited choice, but as I eat eggs & bacon with toast only, I'm okee with that.  Only strange thing is that I requested an extra towel and 2 extra pillows. Hours later…",4
Wonderful service and relaxing stay,22Beebee22,Very accommodating service - we arrived at the hotel early am and our room wasn't (expectedly) ready. Although the hotel had 100% occupancy the night before they still manged to get us into our room by 10am - offering free coffee/tea/biscuits and fruit. The room was beautiful and one of the nicest bathrooms we have utilised. The views to the city from the bathrooms floor to ceiling windows and the glass doors between bedroom and bathroom (for privacy electric blockout blinds on both windows and doors) gave the room lots of natural light.The breakfast was wonderful and the staff delightful - we shall return if we get back to Singapore.,4
Tranquility in Singapore,Gus M,"We were attending Hostess weekender at Fort Canning so this hotel was super convenient.  Hotel rooms are small but well designed, we had a room with a terrace which was great.  The location is fantastic, in the middle of the Botanical gardens so there is no traffic noise and relaxing by the pool is very nice, it is also a short walk to a lot of great Singapore attractions including art galleries and decent cafes and restaurants.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone looking of a slice of tranquility in Singapore.",4
Horrible Experience,JreJre,"I brought my fiancee to this hotel for a single night staycation in early celebration of her birthday. We came with high hopes of this pleasant looking hotel. However, we soon got to experience our worst staycation with this supposedly ""one of the finest"" hotel in Singapore.   Firstly, despite low occupancy rates(manager claimed there were many rooms available), when we entered our deluxe room, we noticed that the house-keeping was not properly done. There were many strands of hair on the bathroom floor and bathtub.   Next, despite claiming that the rooms all came with WIFI, the connection was extremely unstable for usage. HFC claimed that all their rooms were smoke free. However, throughout the day, we could smell smoke in our room. Although the manager on duty kindly helped to…",1

The porter & desk staff were excellent, nothing was too much trouble. We will definitely stay there again.",4
I would definitely stay here next time I'm in Singapore,Lulu_specialist,We had such a great time at the hotel. Such friendly and prompt service. It starts at breakfast with a wonderful chef cooking eggs to order. Later snacks or a light lunch by the pool. A great location like an oasis from the hustle bustle of other areas but easy to navigate by taxi. Next day laundry was convenient and the room felt like a spa! Beautiful marble details and auto window treatments too,5
Romantic Valentine getaway in the garden city,HydroSoh,"“Quiet, romantic, friendly smile all found in this garden in the city” This is something to get you reader started on this review. I have spent a romantic night over the Valentine day this year (2014) in Hotel Fort Canning (HFC). While searching for my ideal Valentine staycation, this hotel caught my eye with their greenery.  I have written a long review for HFC, if you looking for a short review this paragraph would help. HFC is located ideally near shopping districts of Singapore with Fort Canning Park behind them. It’s easily accessed via public transport with places for a drink near them. Clean, quiet and classy boutique hotel with private lounge at the lobby. Excellent and friendly service provided by the English speaking staffs. Comfortable beds and pillows in each room,…",5
Quiet Boutique Hotel,Bernie B,"We stayed for 3 nights at end of Jan.2014.  Quiet , extremely clean with awesome helpful staff. Was an old historical bldg converted to a hotel. The bathrooms were added to where the balcony's used to be, as such  the views are from your bathroom. Quirky but effective. Located up the hill from major streets so if lots of steps are not your thing beware. For the price this hotel is a great buy for the offering.",4
Would be a fantastic stay if not for the noise,ing1,"It was a staycation for 2 nights.  I was quite happy to be allocated to a corner room on the ground floor, facing the slope.  The twin bed room is very clean, including the bathtub! Was impressed as not all house keeping makes an effort to scrub the bathtub to sparkling clean!  I was surprised to see a nespresso machine in the room! In fact, I noticed that they served nespresso coffee in their hotel lobby too, complimentary to guests! Nice nice!  The hotel has great swimming pools too, not packed and very clean.  Having a corner room would be fantastic if not for the noise from 1) the refuse collector every morning for 2 mornings.  Never fail to wake me up in early morning when they come to collect refuse. Now, I am really guessing its the refuse collector, if not why would…",3
An Oasis of calm in a busy city,klopstock,"We stayed for 2 nights while visiting an exhibition in Singapore. It is what I would call a ""Club Hotel"" in that one has the feeling of being in a private club. It seems to have been an old colonial government building at the beginning of its life, set in a lovely tropical park and all of the trees and bushes seem to be naturally grown around the building. As the hotel is not so big, it is not busy. This helps in part with the peaceful feeling. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. One should at peak times allow some time when ordering a taxi. We actually had a couple of taxi's that had never been there before The rooms are converted offices, tastefully and interestingly done, plenty of technology included. It may not be to some tastes as the conversion has been…",5

I had one overlooking the greenery,  simply beautiful.  The bathtub was huge and I enjoy soaking in them and relaxing to music and scented candles.  Room service was prompt and our meals were yummy.  I also enjoyed the complimentary evening canapes and champagne.  Definitely a hotel I would recommend.  Location is great,  in the city area,  while you are a little hidden away from the hustle and bustle surrounded by greenary.",5
Fantastic second visit to boutique hotel,hungtydiner,We chose this hotel again on our return visit to Singapore as we had such a good stay the last time and it did not disappoint. It is located on the edge of Fort Canning Park and as such is away from the hectic surroundings of the city in  Singapore. It is amazing sitting around a pool in the middle of the city that is shaded by trees. Loved the complimentary drinks and canapes at night as well as the complimentary Nespresso coffee and newspaper each morning. We recognised a few of the original staff members and they remembered us as well and went out of their way to make sure we were looked after.

not five star,CHS,"we were very negatively surprised. the main entrance feels like a low ceiling garage entrance with pipes on the ceiling, see attached picture, everything is at extra charge. zero amiability. Breakfast would be acceptable for a three star hotel but surely not for a five star and surely not at extra cost.  we were forced to take breakfast also the second morning because ""prebooked"".  cash money advance at 20% surcharge, taxi to airport for 110 while taxi gets 60 SGD. light system extremely annoying. 3 cm stumple steps in bathroom, water not always reliable hot. walk outside to get into elevators, walk outside and past functional tents, to get to breakfast.

Lovely Hotel,CWAScot,"We stayed here for a staycation for CNY and it was a lovely experience all round. The hotel gives you a feeling more akin to a country mansion than a hotel in the center of Singapore, which is fantastic. It is a good respite from the hectic city life. The staff were pleasant and helpful wherever they could be.   The food was delicious and was good value too. The pool was fantastic and the staff in the pavilion were always willing to take an order no matter what time. Only one thing I noticed is there seems to be a bit of maintenance work needed on painting the outside doors which are all flaking, little things. Additionally I feel there could be more done to the downstairs bar to make it more welcoming and comfortable, it feels sparse and a little soulless, which is all…",4
unique hotel,GShekhar,"I have been in many hotels over the past 20 years, but this one was unique and quirky. the room layout was unconventional but very nice !  the electronics in the room - for lights, curtains and air conditioning were intuitive and worked very well.

Holiday Bed and Breakfast,Mrs B,"Spent Christmas here and it was a nice experience. I can't think of anything bad except for their food.   Cons: 1) Afternoon tea and evening cocktails are literally just choices of tea, coffee, wine, and one cocktail. That's it. I know it's a botique hotel but since it was festive season I guess I expected more. 2) Blant breakfast and limited choices.  Pros: 1) Pool. Loved it. 2) Rooms are clean. 3) Helpful staff.",4
No smiles at Hotel Fort Canning,nisarazak,"My girlfriends and I decided to have a bridal shower gathering cum staycation at Hotel Fort Canning over the weekend. The hotel was idyllic, in the midst of lush greenery and away from the busy city area. It really felt like we were out of Singapore as it was really quaint and quiet. We loved the spacious and comfortable room, especially the beautiful open concept bathroom. The room controls were really high tech. All in all, we had a great stay. However, I felt that the hotel staff were not friendly. They were not smiley, nor welcoming. I think this is really an important factor for a hotel. I hope someone will look into this because it's a pity if this small BUT important issue takes away from a customer's overall experience.",4
Service Excellence,Chris H,"Just spent a week in Singapore staying at Hotel Fort Canning in Singapore. The deluxe room was a good size for a couple and reasonably well appointed. The ambience and decor of the hotel was charming and new and well integrated with the heritage look and feel of the building. The location is brilliant, set in the historic Fort Canning park, and only 5-10mins walk from the CBD. The biggest reason to stay here is the excellent service. The team at the front desk, the lobby bar and the GlassHouse restaurant are first class and can't be helpful enough. A big thanks to Ganga and his team for making my stay a real pleasure.",5
Fantastic hotel in beautiful setting in Singapore,Dianne N,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 nights in January 2014.

Cannot speak highly enough of the staff at the hotel in particular the restaurant staff - Grace, Chester, Kris and Mr Ganga who treated us like family and we were made to feel very welcome. No request was too much trouble.  The breakfast in the Glasshouse Restaurant every morning was a great way to start the day and Chef Tang made eggs to order every morning which he delivered to our table and awesome pancakes.

Great place for a stylish understated getaway,justinbea,"I stayed here with my partner for four nights last Easter and feel bad that I never got around to reviewing it sooner. We had a brilliant time at this hotel - the location was perfect for us. It's in the middle of a large and well-kept park, with loads of options for walking around. You get this, and ready access to the city - the public transport and Orchard Rd are easily accessible on foot.   The pool facilities are excellent and the breakfast was good. The only gripe I had was this: one day there was nobody around to seat us - all the staff were busy - after waiting some time we seated ourselves and there was a slightly embarrassing commotion where the maître d' asked us to go back and wait at the door! I thought this could definitely have been handled better - I'm not much…",5
Peaceful hotel in hectic Singapore,iand210,"We stayed here for two nights in December 2013, en route to Europe. The hotel is lovely, set in Fort canning, which is on a hill behind the Central Orchard Road shopping area.  We had booked and were given a premium luxe room, which was a lovely room with a separate bathroom. However, we were disappointed that this room overlooked the entrance driveway to the hotel rather than being on the second or third floor with a view over the Park city.  Later we saw some deluxe rooms which were the next level down, and we thought that the outlook was actually better than ours even if the room was a little smaller.

An outstanding Hotel to stay in while in Singapore,Sonya B,"When we were planning a short stay in Singapore on the way home from New Years Eve in Hong Kong we decided to give Hotel Fort Canning a try.

The complimentary evening drinks are a really nice touch, perhaps suggest to include beer as well. The little canapes were also pleasant. A short walk to Orchid Rd  through the grounds which are beautiful. This is a quality hotel with the staff to match it.

Not too bad,fairudin,The room is very nice and spacious. Not the usual arrangement. The bed was very comfy and bathroom really spacious with a good open concept with overlooking glass.  Complimentary evening cocktail not fantastic at all. Been to hotels where  they provide other other alcoholic beverages but for this they only provides wines. There were also not enough glasses to go around.  Breakfast is decent. Not much variety of choices but the staffs was really sincere in providing service. Even the chef who manned the omellete sraying go out of his way to talk and bring your order to the table.  Checkin checkout was fast and hassle free.,4
Luxurious Suite,Melissa T,"Totally love the layout of the room when I first arrived.  The suite comes with a dinning/conference room, which is a different touch of any other hotels in Singapore.   Given the outlook & design of the hotel, it definitely feels like I wasn't in Singapore at all. The location may be slightly away from any transportation apart from Taxi, however it is really very peaceful to be in. I look forward in more staycation with this property again.  Staff are approachable & full of smiles.  Nearest MRT Station: Dhoby Ghaut",4

It's located in a park and is different (yet good) setting that what we normally stay in at Singapore, lots of greenery. Location was awesome as it is walking distance to Clark Quay, Orchard Rd and MRT. Rooms are a really good size and nice decor, beds were comfortable. Room service was a little slow, but food was nice. I thought the breakfast was average (food was luke warm or cold). Probably only the real negative is that communication seem to be a problem. Usually we have no problem communicating in English in Singapore but it was a struggle in this hotel, from reception staff to restaurant staff, but we are used to staying in international brand hotels and this is not one. Overall a good trip and the price is reasonable.",3
Peaceful staycation within the city,Autumn_Fish19,I recently stayed one night here for staycation with my husband. We opted for a premium room which had separate bathroom and very much larger. It was big and decent to have a enclosed balcony with a armchair for resting and a writing desk.   Pros about the hotel: 1. Great service: we were brought up and shown around the room. Everyone we met there greeted the guests with a smile.  2. Great rooms: Everything was clean and perfect. The bed must be one of the most comfortable ones. I made full use of the nespresso machine.  3. The pool was empty! Awesome! We had it all to ourselves  4. Complimentary drinks and canapés at the hotel lobby from 6-8pm. Nice touch!  Cons:  1.

A really memorable stay,benahutch,"My stay was not without a hitch, but the really outstanding service from the check-in & guest services staff and the exceptional setting & rooms were enough to overcome two things that would have left me quite annoyed elsewhere.  The first problem was when checking in, I was told I could not use their promotion with Amex that was actually what led me to the hotel in the first place. I followed all instructions listed; I even chose a more expensive rate when booking (I qualified for a cheaper early bird rate) to meet the terms. The check-in staff who was helping us, Ruby, was really understanding and called reservations, but reservations insisted I be denied the discount. The first reason was because it was a blackout day, even though the date was not one of the blackout days…",5

Excellent and charming hotel.,gunawan_karnata8,My first impression with this hotel is fabulous. Room very clean. Nice interior design. Bed very comfy. Breakfast is more than enough to start the day.

The staffs are very friendly and give personal attentions as much as possible, although this is quite a sizable boutique hotel. They are always helpful to the guests. Thank you Cielo for always being so attentive.  The location is convenient too as it is actually within the CBD so the taxi rides to most places in the city is rather short. For shopping, it's only a short 5 minutes walk down hill to Plaza Singapura - an all inclusive complex. Just ask the staffs and they would show you the right path to take.

Unexpected delight,Tetrarch2,"For a business trip, I hadn't expressed a preference for hotel but expected to be placed in one of the larger well-known hotels towards the bay.  The hotel is difficult to fault for its charm - it's all very low-rise and understated. The views are amazing and, for one of the busiest cities in the world it is amazingly calm and quiet.   The room was perfectly fine, clean and stylish with a very comfortable bed - two small niggles, noisy AC, even on a minimum setting and a bizarre shaving-mirror-on-a-stick that wobbled terribly and spoiled the view out of the window.  Breakfast was good, a buffet with plenty of choice and omelettes available cooked-to-order. Honey from a fresh honeycomb was a nice touch.

The hotel is an old colonial style building, located on a small hill in the very heart of Singapore. It is surrounded by a green park - cars need a few turns to make it to the top, while on foot you need ab. 10 mins to get to Doby Ghaut station/Orchard Rd (hint: take a lift to the parking level, and another in the plaza across the road). The rooms are very clean, well equipped and spacious - exceptionally so for Singapore standards, you will have a plenty of room to unpack and move around (and we had but a deluxe room, which is actually the basic standard in this hotel). The decor tastefully matches the old character of the building (but expect high tech solutions -…",5

So convenient enough. The staff were helpful and courteous and always greeted us with a smile. And I think the bathrooms are amazing with great views and a pretty unique design concept.

Problem of this Hotel is that in Spore you will do majority of your trips via a taxi, but the Hotel is  not right on one of the main roads, but it take a cab several minutes to get there from the street. This might be the reason, why the Hotel staff is not able to provide access to a taxi within a normal time. I stayed there for two days and twice I needed to wait between 20-30 min for a cab.  The Hotel is very popular for weddings and conferences, therefore the evenings are quite loud and in the you experience many drunk people in the Hotel lobby. If you try to get a cab at the…",2
Great hotel overall,ManyKnights,Had a very enjoyable stay here and think it fills a strong niche in the Singapore hotel ecosystem.  I stayed here for 5 days in late october after reading the ausbt.com.au review and finding it the most convenient luxury hotel for the Singapore Art Biennale which I was attending multiple days of. Highly recommend if the biennale is part of/is your reason for visiting Singapore.  Much has been said about it's location and I have to say it's very convenient (even walkable in Singapore's sweaty heat) to the galleries and many cultural/historical/art institutions and private galleries nearby. Highly recommend for this purpose but like much of Singapore is easy to get to other must see areas of Singapore too. I shopped on orchard road many nights and again very walkable.   I also…,4
A JUNGLE OASIS IN BUSTLING CITY,toorust,"Stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning for 1 week. Checkin very straight forward, staff very polite and helpful. Taken to room on 3rd floor by receptionist for an explanation of how things work. Clean room had everything I required and a firm but very comfortable bed. I have lower back problems but not on this bed. No pain in the morning - never slept better! Bathroom with a view was a nice touch. 2 swimming pools (one for laps, the other for relax) and a superb gym. Hotel located in a lush tropical park, nice to stroll around each morning before it became too humid. Closest MRT Dhoby Ghaut is a five minute walk away and has access to 3 train lines and great food and shopping at Plaza Singapura. Can get busy on weekends with wedding party and guests. Would stay here again without…",4
Childish behavior from the management,Feelya,"I stayed in this hotel from 29 Oct-2 Nov.  The front desk at checking didn't have the correct check out dates, even though I had a copy of the confirmation.  Then, I was put in a room that had an adjoining room.  The noise next door was terrible and very loud.  Then, I had to check out late and they assured me that I would  be charged a full extra day.  When I returned to my room after the last work day, it hadn't even been cleaned!  I was not amused.  When I called the front desk, they told me I didn't tell them I wanted the room cleaned!  Wow, I was not aware that I had to ask for something I paid for!  I would advise not to stay here, the location is fairly remote for singapore.",1
"Comfortable, Clean and well Positioned",Mike M,My wife and I stayed at Fort Canning Hotel mid 2012.  Can't praise enough.  Great location - excellent modern inclusions - stylish and clean.

They upgraded our room after they learnt about our nuptials and the room was lovely! Can't remember the name of the room but it was one the few rooms with a small balcony, facing the city.  Location is lovely but would recommend you to take a taxi as it is on a hill. To get to the nearby shopping centers is a breeze as it takes a mere 7-10 mins walk downhill.  Breakfast was lovely as well. Love the pools! There were two and we swam at the one at the bottom.  ",5
Singapore stay!,Cheryl C,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this lovely old building. The hotel location was perfect for us and we loved the opportunity to be able to walk through the adjoining park. It is restful and quiet despite being in the centre of busy Singapore. The staff were courteous and friendly and we enjoyed our breakfasts in the Glass a House Restaurant. The hotel facilities were excellent and very happy with our room. The bathroom was modern and the bed was excellent. Thank you for a lovely stay.,5
Good value Historic hotel in Centre of Singapore,mdcryan,"Good rooms, which have been well designed and are very comfortable. here ar 2 pools , the best Gym I have seen anywhere in a hotel and some good restaurants. Gattpopardo deserved special mention as a ver y good Italian restaurant. Another Bonus is you are in the heart of c Singapore, with wonderful walks on the doorstep in Leafy Fort Canning Park.  However the service in the hotel is not great. The staff do not have the same professional standard as some of the other hotels )mainly chains) for the same price and the lobby and public areas don't function as seamlessly as other hotels. For example when I was there there was a wedding going on in the Lobby and et guests were wandering through or sitting in part of the bar.",3
Peaceful and yet minutes away from the shops,Anna F,"This hotel is beautiful inside and out. Wonderful walking paths, minutes from the shops.

From entrance to departure, you can expect the ultimate in service, whilst treating yourself to the very best on offer to the palate and beverage.

An oasis in the city,john k,The staff are what makes this hotel. They are professional and listen to all your requests. The location is good especially if you want to explore the city away from the temptations of the shops. If you want to be close to the shops then this may not be the hotel for you (though the train station is very close) It is very quiet in fact there were some days that we wondered if there was anyone else staying at the hotel! This is a real treat. It was lovely looking out your bathroom window and just seeing the lush greenery of the parkland. I wonder how this hotel will age as you can see a lot of wear and tear. Especially in the bathrooms (paint coming off the bathroom doors and marks down the corridors) There are a couple of areas for improvements. Only giving one towel per guest…,4

Conveniently located,ABegs,"We booked a premium room which had a separate sitting area with views of the garden. The comfortable bedroom had a nespresso coffee machine which we loved. Pity there were not more capsules. There was also a flat screen tv. The lights, aircon and blinds were operated by a hi-tech controller located beside the bed. The large bathroom had a shower with a rain head, bath, scales and lots of extras. The hotel is in fort canning, a short walk to Orchard Rd and a stroll thru' the park to Clarke Quays. The park was beautiful.  The hotel had 2 swimming pools, a lap pool and a sculpted pool. They had outlooks to the park and had ample shaded seating. Loved the hotel.

The airconditioning was quite noisy and a little hard to regulate. Breakfast in the glass house was included in the package as was the ""fivers"" . Breakfast had a good variety of Asian and western choices which was great. The service was great, the staff were if anything over attentive which sometimes made it hard to just relax over breakfast and the seating felt tight ( small details in an excellent overall experience.)

Service is still not up to standard,Uffizi930,"This is my second time staying at Fort Canning hotel. The first time was when it first opened. It's a beautiful hotel overall. The landscape, the architecture, the room. The rooms are beautiful but not very practical. I find it difficult to work with the small desk and the WiFi get disconnected often, therefore not good for business trip. It's probably perfect for leisure trip.  The staff are very courteous and trying their best to satisfy customer. But somehow the check in is still not efficient enough.  Unfortunately, my trip was cut short due to family matter. The front desk was kind enough to try and help me get a refund for the rest of the stay. But at the end it didn't get accepted. However, still appreciate the frontline staff for their empathy.",4
Excellent Hotel,Me_n_my_rucksack,"We stayed here for one night at the end of 3 weeks traveling across Indonesia.  Everything about the Hotel was superb.    The building is a wonderful colonial era military structure - very ""height of the British Empire"".  The rooms were possibly the most pleasant we have stayed in on our many travels - everything in there was of good quality and the feel of the room was just right - some Hotels try to over do gizzmos and dd too much ""quirky"" design features - whereas this room was relaxing / comfortable but excellent technology subtly added (loved the espresso (i think it was) coffee maker and ipod docking station.).

"Quirky, Quiet and Great",Paul B,"The hotel and the location are great. The hotel, being an old refurbished and modernised building, is quite quirky in nature, but in a good way. Its different from the norm which made it a more interesting stay. During the week the hotel was very quiet, due to its location, and the size of the hotel. I spent time in both pools alone in the peace and quiet, with only the sounds of nature in the background. I went to both restaurants whilst there, and they were both good, and once again quiet, although on a weekend they seemed to be busier. The bar always seems to be quiet as well. I think this is probably due to the complimentary drinks on offer between 6 and 8 pm. I had the breakfast a couple of times, and although it was good, I often just walked 5 mins to the Singapore Plaza…",5

Shopping at the famous orchard road is no problem as its situated nearby. Amazing isn't it,a great location!  The service of the hotel staff is also good and they make sure we enjoy our stay there. They explain to us how to use the amenities provided in the room as the set-ups are modern and very up-to-date.

On the south side of the hill there is stairwell and 2 min walk to Clarke Quay restaurants on the riverfront. Room very clean and comfy. Pillows divine (I am very pillow-fussy).

Close to Orchard Road, the Singapore National Museum and other attractions. Also very close tot he MRT - the very efficient underground train service.

I like the breakfast as it was not too heavey and good for fast moving business traveller. After a hard day work, the pool and the gym were excellent for me to relax and rejuvenate.  The gym was complete with full exercise machine. Food - room service was a unusual experience. Top of all is the free coffee and wine at the lobby every evening!",5
Never been disappointed,Jun W,"Having stayed in HFC on our several trips to Singapore, I must say that we have never been disappointed before.  On the most recent trip, I noticed that they have made some adjustment & threreby we get to have more space in the room to move around. That was great as we tend to come back with bags from shoppings!  The staffs are always that helpful & friendly as ever.  I can see that the hotel has put in lots of effort to upkeep & maintain the luxury. The in-room touch button controls are easy to handle now.

Very nicely fitted out and furnished to suit the colonial architecture.  Two very nice pools to choose from.  We had a garden courtyard room which for us was the best option.

The room was spacious and comfortable, with a large bed, flat-screen tv, bathtub and marble-floored bathroom that faces the patio through a wall-to-wall window that stops halfway down for modesty. The furnishings are modern and tasteful, and there was a personalised greeting screened on the TV waiting for us when we got in - a very nice touch.

We choose the Hotel Fort Canning for its location and character of building where our father possible once worked in the 1950's. Our choice was perfect. The hotel is finished to a very high standard and the staff go out of their way to be friendly and helpful. On our last day we were allowed to keep our room for an extra couple of hours and our luggage was then stored ready for collection for our night flight home. We were also shown where we could shower and change ready for our journey home. Fantastic service.

I love the colonial decor, the designer lobby, the comfortable patio, bottomless Nespresso coffee and cookies - which is changed to wine and canapes during the cocktail hour. The bedrooms, while small are tastefully done and equipped with hi tech controls. The bathroom is very impressive and the high 13 foot ceilings and big mirrors just add to how grand they made it. Service is fantastic and I love the work ethics of the staff who do things beyond what they are supposed to do to help each other out. The location is equally fantastic as you can explore one if the more historical parks in the city and the National Museum both of…",4
A unique gem,Pllf,"We booked HFC for a 1 night staycation and it was one of the most memorable hotel stays. We booked the Weekend Retreat Package and it was definitely worth it, including brunch and late checkout. We love the decor of the hotel, the unique bathroom layout, the 2 mineral water pools and the complimentary evening drinks and canapes which was a nice touch. We had the sparkling wine and canapes which were v yummy! Staff were friendly and helpful. V obliging when we asked one to take photos for us. Romantic and quiet. The perfect place for a couple weekend getaway. Will definitely be going back again!",5
Just as good second time around,Vicki T,"I liked Hotel Fort Canning on my first visit and liked it even more second time around.  My flight arrived early (and left early) and I really appreciated an early check in and flexibility with breakfast.  The receptionist on duty when I arrived was a star - I had no S$ to pay the taxi driver who would only take cash - he rescued me (with no trouble at all) by paying the taxi and put the charge on my bill. All the Reception staff are really excellent. Once again, I found getting from the hotel to/from work and the airport quick and easy. I love the rooms (great having a Nespresso machine), the pool (great for laps), outstanding breakfast and the evening drinks.  I had time for a walk around the Gardens - fabulous, highly recommended.Will stay again!",5
An Oaisis,Suzworld,We were given a fabulous room on the third floor overlooking the city. Our bathroom was like a glass cube so we could lounge in the tub or shower looking at the view.  This place has charm being in an older Singapore building but completely up to date. We loved the complimentary cocktails in the evening and especially the Italian Prosecco - my favorite! The breakfast was sumptuous with all the smoked salmon we could eat and even roti cani - my favorite Malaysain breakfast.  The staff were very helpful and pleasant. We felt nurtured.,5
A unique hotel,DEGGuildford,"Had my second stay last week at this wonderful boutique hotel. The rooms are elegant and the staff couldn't be more helpful. The location, up in Fort Canning Park, gets you away from the hustle and bustle of the city. But Clarke Quay is only 5 minutes taxi ride away.",5
Wonderful stay at Hotel Fort Canning,T_GPrice,"We spent a wonderful 7 days at Hotel Fort Canning.  The rooms are lovely and specious and- look out into the gardens.  I was working for a couple of days but on the other days we made the most of the beautiful pools.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is really good and a wonderful selection.  They have drinks and nibbles every afternoon in a beautiful garden setting - very civilized.  The proximity to Orchard Road and Clarke Quay make this a great place to stay in Singapore - close to everything but in a beautiful, quiet garden setting.  We will stay there again I'm sure",5
Lovely stay,GillyM-S,"The staff are excellent, nothing was too much trouble, the Guests lounge area is very welcome & having complimentary tea & coffee available during the day and wine & soft drinks + nibbles available early evening is a very nice touch. We loved our room, even the bathroom being set in the original balcony area but did find the openness of the shower panel through to the toilet abit disconcerting, even as a couple. We feel a low modesty panel between the bed area and the shower would be give a degree of privacy, We got confused with the mood lighting & blinds auto switches, and really would have preferred reading lights being close to each side not up in ceiling, We enjoyed the buffet breakfast very much, definitely a good selection to set you up for the day. We would recommend the…",4
awesome wedding location,airotciv86,"i had my wedding ceremony at HFC on 20 Jul 2013, and along with the ceremony package came a complimentary stay in one of their rooms, which i used on 19 Jul. the service from the moment i checked in was impeccable - no, wait, from the point i was planning the wedding with the help of the manager in-charge, Priscilla. she was friendly and professional, very helpful and catered to all my requests with a smile. The wedding was wonderful - guests complimented the buffet lunch and everything went without a glitch, from the AV staff to the waiters and waitresses at lunch - they were all so delightful people to work with. It was perfect!   Room-wise - we LOVED it. charming, colonial-styled room with great lighting during the day. we particularly enjoyed the high-ceilings and long…",5

not for the business traveller.,rachel-natalie,"i was asked to stay in singapore for two nights for work and decided to book hotel fort canning. i was taken in by the charm of the refurnished colonial building and that fact it was in the city yet atop a hill which meant some peace and quiet.  pros: 1/ impeccable service - the staff are friendly, and extremely helpful. i was particularly impressed that one of the cleaners knew exactly where the spa was and was extremely detailed and articulate in giving directions to the spa. 2/ the layout of the room is interesting - the bathroom is at the end of the room facing out into the city. 3/ rooms are of a decent size (i stayed in the deluxe room), pretty well decorated (except for the two hideous looking garbage-bag looking cushions on the bed) and furnished. my partner particularly…",3
We Shall Return!,Sue0862,"We made our booking through Booking.com a week before arriving in Singapore and were able to secure a very good package for a Premium King Room including breakfast. After a full on day of travelling through Indonesia, we arrived very tired around 9pm and were not totally optimistic of what we might find having had an average experience at another Singapore hotel a week before. The welcome we received was exceptional and sincere. We quickly ascertained that a separate bed had not been included for our eight year old daughter (even though Booking.com had indicated it was). Two staff immediately made up a trundle bed in the extended living area of our room which also had two beautiful doors giving privacy to the main bedroom area. We were offered complimentary drinks while waiting…",5
Definite getaway spot,sodiumion,"We bought a Groupon (priced at around $288) for this hotel, so it's pretty much cheaper than the listed price.  We got there after lunch, just in time for check-in. The staff was friendly, and check-in was a breeze. Since we were staying for just one night, we only had one small backpack each. Even so, the staff offered to take our backpacks up to our rooms, which I think was a lovely gesture of hospitality.  The room we were given was spacious, with a balcony sitting area overlooking a part of Fort Canning, which made a tranquil picture, given the big glass windows of the balcony. The bathroom, however, was the bomb. Large standalone bath tub, separate shower, and a good set of amenities. I think this was pretty much the clincher for me.  Most hotels wouldn't bother with such…",4
Fabulous!,wintryposy,"Centrally located near to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, this charming hotel sits atop a hill and is surrounded by lush greenery.  Receptionists are friendly and engage in small conversation, taking you to the room and ensuring best service is provided.  Hotel is impeccable in terms of décor, ambience and comfort.  Room was huge, spacious and private. What impressed us was the clever use of technology, using touch controls for all the lightings and curtains in the room. Definitely very modern.  We also had a lovely dinner at the restaurant and the food was fantastic.  Swimming pools are well-kept and relaxing.  There are also complimentary drinks and snacks in the morning and evening for guests, making guests feel pampered.  It was a splendid stay and I highly recommend this romantic hotel…",5
Elegant and sophisticated,Bertie33,"Set in beautiful grounds, the main building is a grand colonial mansion atop a hill, near the famous Raffles House and spice garden (well worth a visit). It is not too far from the tourist centres (e.g. Clarke Quay). The hotel has the feel of a boutique hotel, with wonderfully appointed rooms, filled with remote-control gadgetry. The bathroom afforded a wonderful view across the green at the back of the hotel. It boasts no fewer than three swimming pools, which, notably, have unchlorinated water. The restaurant had a wide range of dishes marrying the three main culinary traditions of the region, Chinese, Malay and Indian. Both the facilities and service were in keeping with the standard of this kind of hotel, whereas the room had an understated sophistication and chic, combined…",4
A quiet hotel in the heart of the city,Kev,"after much deliberation, we chose this hotel for a short honeymoon. the hotel sits on a hill and has a great architecture having been refurbished from an old colonial building. upon our early arrival we were greeted by a friendly staff who personally brought us to our specially prepared room! the room was spacious and comfortable. we enjoyed it so much that most of our time was spend in the lounging area sipping wine and enjoying the comforts and view from the room. in short, it was a very pleasurable experience staying here!  Note: As this hotel sits on a hill, transport may be required to travel out of the hotel.",5

So central with the MRT train lines only a few minutes away,especially with local station Dhoby Ghaut being a major exchange for several lines.   We really enjoyed the walk through the grounds of Fort Canning,so interesting to see all the buildings,although all  the stairs are a challenge. Glass house restaurant is just lovely.Buffet breakfast is fantastic, room service very prompt,and dinner menu beautiful.(Manjari dessert is just divine!)

Really cool and nice hotel! Perfect location!!!,suarez_mariana,"I loved staying at HFC.  The attitude of the staff was great! They really made me feel at home. I also loved the innovative setting of the room, with the bathroom in the window side of the room.  The bed was really comfortable, and I loved that there is a Nespresso machine in the room! I'm a coffee person, so I also liked the 24 hrs. availability of Nespresso coffee in the lobby. The bar area is also a nice place, where you can work.  The location of the hotel is perfect! You are in the middle of the city, and you can easily walk to Orchard Rd, and to the financial district!   The architecture of the hotel building is beautiful!  Electricity plugs are versatile, to use plugs from different parts of the world, so you don't need any converter. And there is a nice speaker, where…",5
A little treasur in Singapore,Heidrun G,"A place which has to be recommended! Located directly at the Fort Canning Park on one side, and on the other side not far away from Doby Ghaut MRT station it's ideal for business visitors and tourists. The building outside is colonial style, inside modern, a great mix. The rooms offer all, what you need. The high ceilings are great, and the wodden floor perfectly fits. The staff is very friendly, and helpful. The visit started with a very warm welcome. Every day between 6 -8 pm, guests are invited to happy hour .... Free of charge!!!! Wlan is included, and even at the pool possible!  Great stay, and for sure not the last time here!!!",5
Excellent experience + extremely attentive staff!,Alexander8896,"This hotel is very very cozy. Location - away from skyscrappers/street noise, yet 5 min away from everything you need in Singapore.

A wonderful place to escape to.,Globeseek,I was fortunate to travel to Singapore twice in a month - my first stay was here - my second stay was at the Intercontinental - it was an interesting contrast in style.   Hotel Fort Canning feels much more of boutique hotel - much slower pace - beautiful views from the room and from the area you have breakfast - and the breakfast is wonderful one of the best I have ever had.   I did have issues off and on with the wireless - but it was not too tragic - I enjoyed having a nespresso machine in my room.  It might be good to carry the address or a map with the location with you when you are out and about - as most taxis had issues figuring out where the hotel was ...  In most every aspect I enjoyed this hotel... I did not choose it for my second stay as I was staying with my family…,4
My review can't do it justice.,Diane F,"We stayed here last November but I have struggled to make my review worthy of our stay at Fort Canning.  First the welcome, so nice and wine delivered to our room in a beautiful wooden box with fine glassware.  Our room had a separate lounge with Tv and lounge and our room was huge.  The king size bed that you could walk around, a bath you could walk around, floor to ceiling windows, high ceilings and balcony.  Every morning and night hotel staffed called in to check if we needed anything but everything was always there.  Complimentary drinks and canapés in the guest lounge was a great place to meet other guests.  The wines and nibbles were high quality and plenty for everyone.  Coffee, fruit and biscuits were always available too.  The breakfast was the best I have ever had and…",5
A wonderful experience!,summergalz,"Recently stayed at Hotel Fort Canning with my partner for our anniversary celebration. The whole experience was a very memorable one indeed. A colonial style hotel, coupled with the relaxing & greenery surroundings from the Fort Canning Park. Definitey a great getaway from the bustling city!  Upon our arrival at the hotel we were greeted by friendly & cheerful staff, making us feel very much at ease and we know that we will be in very good hands throughout our stay. The staff is also very merticulous, and we like how they walk us personally to our rooms and give a brief introduction of the room and the facilities available. Imagine a balcony bathroom!  The room is also very equiped with high-end technology - TV with internet facilities controlled by remote/keyboard,…",5
2D1N Staycation,SL_Tan68,"Spent a relaxing Saturday enjoying the well-equipped gym and pool facilities, before retiring to a beautifully decorated room. The interior was modern with a touch of old colonial style, nicely juxtaposed against the lush green surroundings and swimming pool. Service was prompt and obliging with a smile, and the room had high speed wifi as well as a variety of television channels. Every aspect of the room displayed attention to detail especially the high tech console (which doubled up as a remote for the air-conditioning, television and blinds!) which did not go unnoticed. A stone's throw from the popular Clarke Quay area, easily accessible via taxi or train, I would definitely return again soon to treat myself to a weekend of blissful indulgence and relaxation.",5

Stayed for 5 days for business,JoolianP,Stayed at The Fort Canning again on business for the second time this year.  Good I do like the setting in Fort Canning - surrounded by gardens with zero traffic noise. Broadband in the room is good - but you need to ask for a cable to link to ethernet as it is much faster than wireless which keeps asking you to reconnect or slows. Nasi Goreng delivered to room was quick and very good. Swimming pools are huge and quiet. Doormen are friendly and quick at getting cabs for my many meetings. Roti prata for breakfast and an omlette man who is very keen to make one for you.  Bad It's not quite 5 star - a couple of times there were no towels by the pools or finished room service was not collected for quite a while. Aircon in rooms is really not quiet enough.,4
Colonial Sexyness,Giga_Traveller9800,"a sexy colonial style hotel that is very rich in heritage. The owners put a lot of thought into the comfort of guests and aesthetics. You get a nice view of well kept, nostalgic looking trees that must be 50 years old. Staff are overall helpful and friendly and the rooms well kept and very uniquely furnished and arranged. You feel like royalty living in a palace!   If you can figure out how to navigate the neighbouring building, access to the subway is actually very near.   A definite stay to complete the Singapore experience!",5
Food outlets disappointing,Bluesphynx,"Wonderfully green set amidst the spice gardens and tall trees of Fort Canning Hill, a great respite from the crowded city centre. The colonial flavour of the tastefully-restored building gives the place a historical flavour, simply loved the bathroom on the balcony with the generous bath tub and the rainshower, couldn't fault the huge TV and free internet access as well as the choice of pools for kids and adults.  However, the biggest letdown was the lack of good food on the premises.  The two restaurants were far too expensive for the quality of food offered especially the brunch at the cafe offering local food.  There was a children's birthday party going on at the same time and hotel diners, though considerately given tables in the adjoining bar, had to squeeze past the…",4

We reported this to the main desk and two hours later without fuss were given a room further down the same corridor away from the resonating sounds. My wife suffers from Coeliac disease and can only eat Gluten free bread, so every time we travel the first thing we do prior to confirmation of the booking is to ensure the bread will be available at breakfast as that will be her staple food along with eggs. I had immediate confirmation this would not be a problem until we arrived and asked for the bread only to be told they do not have it but…",3
Classy stay,Marinagypsy,"This Heritage listed building is beautifully appointed on the hill surrounded by acres of gardens and walking paths, overlooking much of Singapore. It has a wonderful sense of history  Its calm and relaxing.  Walking to attractions is easy if you don't mind the heat.  Our  basic room (quite pricey) was clean, lovely with a great espresso machine and extra comfy bed. Breakfast just OK by international standards, but staff courteous and polite. Walking around the hill gardens was fabulous. Just get a taxi from the airport to the hotel - all the cabbies know where it is.  We were picked up by the hotel, but it cost over $HK100.",4
Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city!,prashantg11,"We visited Singapore in February, this year during the Chinese New Year. I had stayed in this hotel earlier during my business visit, and i thought it to be good place for personal trips. We spent two nights here and need less to say, it was nice, as always. The hotel is it seems was a heritage buidling earlier, converted to a luxury hotel in the last few years. Most of the rooms are nice, however, a few are very good, especially due to the large bathrooms. They have a glass house restaurant, which provides good continental food. Though, we had limited options, being from India and preferring vegetarian food, we managed to eat what they offered. It is surrounded by the canning park, which provides a good place for walk.

Staycation Sucess!,bennelli,"Just a brief escape for the weekend with my wife, and another couple.   The only thing negative about this place was that there wasn't all that much to do. We spent the time at the pool or lazing in the room. And the breakfast was a little underwhelming. in comparison to lets say, W hotel at sentosa.   Now for the positives. It definitely gave me a sense of boutique and luxury. Service was good, hotel smelled good, and the pool was relatively clean. Besides the few screamy kids by the pool, it was relatively peaceful place to relax. While choosing a hotel for the staycation, many places were full up. While it may not be good for business, it was nice that the hotel seems a little more quiet.   Rooms Stay at the most basic room. Deluxe if I am not wrong. Nicely designed rooms,…",4

Terrific modern re-make of an historic building,brysc01,"Perched on a hill in a very private and strangely quiet part of Singapore, you could think you were in the jungle. This is definitely a hotel to try, for its location, ambience and stunning re-fit.  We stayed for a three night stopover and it make a refreshing change from a city location, although you still are in the heart of town between Clark Quay and Orchard Road. The two swimming pools were one of the reasons we chose the HFC, large and inviting, yet uncrowded and surrounded by green. A large freeform and another 30m or so lap pool, perfect! We had a deluxe room with study annex. I tried to work out the unusual layout that some reviews discussed and it becomes apparent. It may not suit all folk, but having the huge bathroom along  the outside of the building is certainly…",4

romantic getaway,RCM123,"stayed here on my birthday in a premium room that was facing the park. It was clean, quiet. The room itself was a little bit small, with the king sized bed taking up most of the room. the bed greets you the minute you open the door. What made up for the small bed room, was the HUGE  marble clad bathroom with tub and rain shower as well as the indoor balcony.   The reception, area had free coffee, tea and biscuits.   The breakfast was sufficient, not an overflowing morning buffet but a conservative array of fruit, yogurt, eggs and pancakes.   To get to the shopping malls like Plaza Singapura and the MRT, there is a short cut thru Park Mall carpark.   Close to the city but it was quiet and restful. would I stay here again? Yes indeed!",4
Stunning hotel set in beautiful parkland in central Singapore,Gemma D,"From the minute we pulled up at Fort Canning we could tell that we had made the right choice. The hustle and bustle of Singapore was a mere stones throw away but the setting of the hotel was serene and peaceful. A real contrast to Orchard Road which only a 5 minute walk away.  The friendly staff made us very welcome, taking our bags and offering cold water as we checked in. The interior of the hotel ensured the history was not lost, a glass floor in the reception area showed off the artefacts that had been discovered on the site, but this was set against a modern yet traditional design with white walls and traditional furniture, minimalist but very comfortable. The sweeping staircase was also a lovely touch and gave the hotel a luxurious feel. Don't worry, there were lifts to…",5
Depends on what you want,John A,"The Hotel Fort Canning is in a beautiful location, and the hotel is in a nice central location -- easy access to almost anything you want. On top of that, the hotel is in a historic building, which was refurbished a couple do years ago. That is the good part.   As a business traveller, on the road 20 to 30 weeks a year, I find the luxury hotels in Asia ""over the top"" in terms of quality, service, cleanliness, convenience, and classiness. It is tough to out class the Shangri-La, the Peninsula, the Four Seasons, the Conrad, etc.  So, I like to take a chance on the boutique hotels. And, this is why I found myself at the Fort Canning.   There were a few nasty surprises:  1.  The air conditioning might work for some people, but not for me. I set the control as low as it went and the…",2
A hotel in the park,christopher e e,"The first thing we liked was the fact it was situated in a park that was not noisy by Singapore standards, and was only three floors high.

At the end of the 8 days I realised my Suunto watch was not in the room anymore, so I started looking for it.

This is a low cost, low maintenance luxury hotel and very good value for money. Avoid the basic rooms with the weird bathroom arrangement and go for a premium with a small surcharge.

Due to be picked up at 7.00am and taken to the airport, we ordered an in-room breakfast for 6.30am (the dining room does not open until 7.00am). After much chasing on our part, it arrived at 14 minutes to 7.00 without any sign of an apology. The public spaces could do with a better cleaning crew and the bell boys need a spruce up. On the plus side, the food was excellent especially in the Italian restaurant. Unlikely to stay again. John and John",3

Rooms was not ready for check in at 2pm but although the complimentary nespresso was a nice gesture after a long flight you're simply craving a shower, right? The rooms a very stylish with bathtubs arranged like a throne in the middle of the room and high tech controls which in my cases didn't work properly (ac set to 18°C and couldn't be changed) Supposedly there are ice machines on the floors but in reality there are none and I had to wait over one hour for ice after calling room service three times.

Good but a few flaws,JoolianP,"I stayed in April on business. The hotel is very good but has a few flaws.

Breakfast was included and buffet was good, the man cooking omlettes was very keen to make them. Room was good size with desk for working. Position is secluded in Fort Canning with no traffic noise.  Bad Position is secluded - a little wait for taxis sometimes. Air conditioning in my room, 339, was noisy and came on and off rather than flowing constantly - had to switch off when sleeping which is strange in Singapore, home of aircon.",4
"Great Location,heritage,refurbishment style but not spick and span",bertandjenny,"I think I am correct in saying that this hotel had changed from its recent history as hotel facility for and offshore Country Club some 18 mths ago Location , style and room option fit outs where potentially 5 star. Overall we enjoyed our stay. It is a great retreat from the congestion and hustle and that is Singapore-and getting more so each visit. Would we stay again. I dont think so. The reason being the standard of room maintenance and the culture [with one or two exceptions] of the need to maintain standards.

We were back there for a staycation to celebrate Valentine and early birthday celebration of mine on end Feb 2013.    Great location, quiet environment as it is away from the hustle and bustle from the centre yet it is still within walking distance to the city - Orchard.  Room was nicely furbished, big bathtub that we like, good room ambiance.  Their services was always great.  Food there was nice!  Their staffs were always welcoming and smiling to attend to your needs.    For drinkers or those that loves to club, Clarke Quay was just a stone throw away.

Horrible Service,melanieish,"Checked in at 3.20pm but was told that there was no room available and that I had to wait. This was surprising to me as the usual check in time was at 2pm. The staff told me the deluxe King bedded room I had booked was not available and if I was ok with twin beds. It was an anniversary so obviously I didn't want twin beds.  The staff told me to wait. I waited with my fiance for about 30 minutes. During this time, no one apologised or attended to us with welcome drinks and there was a coffee machine but no cups available.  When we got the room, we were impressed with the room. Clean and spacious but when I went to bed that night, I realised I was sleeping on 2 twins beds that were joined together!

Fashionable hotel and great location,John C,Great location. Fort canning is away from the hustle and bustle but within walking distance to the city centre. It's also a really nice park to walk around. Pool is nice but no pool attendant. Rooms are very nice...nespresso and Bose speakers are a nice touch. Air con system needs improving. It turns on and off randomly. Breakfast is ok but not excellent. Overall a great option at this price. ,4
"Good, not great.",Chip_blue,"I had 6 nights in this hotel in a deluxe room recently. Positives: Beautiful old building, very good hotel gym with good weights and cardio equipment, room nicely furnished with large comfy bed and lovely bathroom including nice separate bath. Lovely park setting with views to the city or garden depending on the side of the building. Wifi is free, toiletries ok. 5 min walk to orchard rd and dauby ghat MRT station, 10 to Clarke quay. 2 lovely pools. Downsides: Hotel on side of hill of canning park, meaning a large volume (approx 300) steps to the hotel from the orchard rd side. You can't escape a climb to this hotel in the heat without taking a taxi from any direction.

Making an art of unfriendliness,Bret M,"I come to Singapore 45-50 times each year, so know the hotels here well. Normally stay in Raffles or the Naumi or Capella or Fullerton Bay. This time (for recreating rather than doing business) I tried the Fort Canning Hotel, for two reasons - I love heritage buildings, and the hotel was recommended by Singapore Airlines. Can't fault the building (beautiful) or the setting (green, elevated, tranquil) but caveat emptor. The rooms are small but comfortable, the beds good. But the service is extraordinarily awful - non-existent really. This hotel has all the trappings of an adequate but expensive 4 star hotel, but the service and atmosphere of a twenty dollar hostel. When we arrived, the doorman turned away to talk on his phone, so we had to take our own bags out of the car and…",3
need a lot of improvement,xiaokelian,"stayed during valentine's day and it was a surprise move from my husband. The hotel should add day curtains or one way see thru window from room to protect guest privacy, the hotel should also consider one switch for each blind control. we left home late night and came back the next early morning, to my surprise the things in the room moved. maybe they thought i check out? bathroom only have one glass cup? suppose to have two. i had tomyam soup in the glass house but it tasted like plum soup.  afterall, jasmin the manager was very helpful and attentive she will assist you in all ways.

Was really excited about what HFC got to offer, after seeing so many reviews and feedback. The hotel was located at a tranquil hill top, and peaceful surroundings. We reached at about 12odd in the afternoon, and we were told to wait until 2pm for our check-in. There were only 2 personnel serving, but there were many guests waiting for their check-in. Another 2 personnel came over to help, but unfortunately there were only 2 laptops to work on. There was no one to guide the check-in process, and only when my boyfriend took the initiative to start queueing behind the counter, did the rest of the guests follow.

"Generally, good.",glolee,"Stayed over for a weekend.   Room was cozy and chic, the full length window that separated the room from the bath room was a nice touch. peering out of the window, you are greeted by a hint of colonial architecture which lends some grandure to the room.  Unfortunately- there were a couple of spoilers. (1) there were feaces stains in the toilet bowl- something I consider wholly unaccpetable, and (2) the drainage for the shower area did not work which almost flooded the bathroom. If the hotel whips their room-cleaning team in shape, the hotel will be much better... Til then, I will only rate it as being ""average"".",3

The room was very clean. Quite well-maintained. Even the toilet, it's quite big & spacious. Great for couples ;)  Only thing was the toilet paper roll, it was ""concealed"" so neatly in a box, beside the box of toiletries, that one would quickly mistaken why there's no spare roll on the flush basin!

Nespresso machines and high quality TV complete the luxury feel.  The two pools are lovely and the views from the terrace are enchanting.   There are, as always, a few drawbacks. The sound insulation of the rooms is poor and on day one I was woken at 8am by some particularly piercing and melancholy Chinese music coming along the hallway.This is not the hotel to chose if you want to pop out regularly on foot as its hilltop location means that a taxi ride is required to get anywhere.

Most of the staff are excellent...but there are some housekeeping issues. Menus in the rooms were out of date (or just not supplied), dirty dishes were not removed by housekeeping, soap was removed from the hand basin and not replaced (even after a phoned request), there was a noisy function one night in the Italian restaurant (which is closed every Wednesday--halving the room service menu!), and the monsoon shower had a mind of its own (hot/cold/monsoon/drizzle).

Good location amidst nice surroundings,wtgn_ling_sg,"We bought an online voucher and had a one-night staycation at this property, so value-wise we bagged a really deal. This hotel is located on the top of the Fort Canning Hill, so the first criteria for those planning to stay is to have strong legs & minimal luggage. Otherwise, take the cab up. Getting down to town (going downhill is always easier), just take the flight of steps located in front of the lobby and you'll be at the shops, a train interchange and bus stops which connects you to the other parts of the island. Alternatively, follow the vehicular road down to the other side of town and take a leisure walk to Chinatown / Singapore River.  It is also recommended to walk around the property and adjacent park in the morning, especially if you are a nature and/or photography…",4
Great stay!,moddishh,"Hotel fort canning is a must stay and the beds are so comfortable. Since it's a new hotel, all the furnishings and digital tv and ipod docks are a big win. It's very value for money and would be more comfortable than the older and expensive hotels along the orchard street stretch. The only thing that was lacking was the hotel facilities, the breakfast buffet was rather horrifying and the pool was average. But the great hotel room really made our stay, so my advice is just spend the entire day in the room  thanks hfc!",4
Attractive hotel with room for improvement,mrsseah,"I stayed one night at Hotel Fort Canning and left with mixed feelings. While the renovations to the hotel have been extensive and often impressive, there are a several elements which should be improved to make a guest's stay an impeccable one. I'll start off with what we loved:  Deluxe Room (City-facing) Spacious, luxurious with modern fixtures. The king-sized bed is extremely comfortable and enough pillows were provided. There is an area with a chaise-lounge seating to put your feet with a book if you don't feel like lying in bed. The open-concept bathroom is the star of the room, with marble floors and large bath with a picture window to the city. The toiletries were of good quantity and quality. We especially enjoyed the touch devices which controlled the lighting,…",4

The rooms are all done in a modern, minimalistic style, with an open concept bathroom located on the balcony. Believe not all rooms are done this way but it sure was a ""wow"" factor when we stepped in. Everything in the room is high tech with buttons for everything (and the buttons light up when you wave your hands in front of it so that you can find it in the night).

Last hotel which upset me,PassionforAsia,"Checked in around 6:45 am in January. The lady at the reception was stone cold and did not even act to be happy to welcome a guest!

The printout she was carrying clearly showed otherwise, which she struck out with a pen and wrote ""1"". I was not in mood to say anything at that time. She was lucky!!!  The staffs at the breakfast restaurant don't smile at all and seem to be unhappy with their job in serving breakfast. I never saw any of them smile in our four days of having breakfast at the hotel.

My favourite is the evening wine & canapés compliments of the hotel. I have not come across this elsewhere. One would really appreciate it after a long day.   The Glass House was booked for an event hence my dinner appointment was not possible. Instead the friendly staffs set it in the garden verandah.

Historical hotel,Paul S K,A lovely hotel in the middle of a historical park in the central district of Singapore. Our group of 5 took three Executive rooms all facing the park.

The tour of the British bunker during the fall of Singapore located just across from the hotel was very interesting. We only noticed the bunker because people kept coming out of this descript looking metal service door on the hill side directly across from our window.

All the 5-star hotels offer terrific service, and now there is a burgeoning uber-luxe industry of 6-star competitors edging in on their territory, offering even grander jaw-dropping, eye-popping, over-the-top come-ons.

On our first 3 nights we had to ask for towels etc as there was nothing in the bathroom. It was also sad to see that the floors in the common areas were not clean, a mop and bucket would prove useful instead of a dry mop. The bar also does not serve food during the day despite menus being available on the tables. Of greater concern was the storage of rubbish in a position that blocked fire exits on 2 levels and staff were very complacent with no sense of pride in their work.

A great retreat in a bustling metropolis - that could benefit from a bit of professional attention,bidione,"We've stayed at Fort Canning Hotel when we visited Singapore on a stopover vacation over Christmas. What makes this really special is its location inside the Fort Canning park tucked away from the bustling city, the fact that this is a historic landmark building converted into a hotel which is much nicer than the anonymous hotels that could be just anywhere and its perfect location to some of the city's major attractions and the public transportation system.  The hotel does, however, at the same time suffer a bit from some of these things so it's a bit of a mixed bag experience - which we still liked.  First of all, the fact that this is a historical buidling limits the number of hotel rooms. Not that we are keen of  staying in one of the mega-hotels, but just 80-something rooms…",4

Get up early and go for a long walk through the surrounding gardens. Make sure you see the Spice Garden. There is a sameness to large hotels in big cities. This is just small enough to be personal. Nice touches like no password needed for WiFi and a complimentary bottle of decent red wine. Although we checked out at about noon, the hotel held our luggage until late that day and allowed us to shower and change before our evening flight for no extra charge. But it is the location on the hill that makes this special. No traffic noise, a view of green trees, places to walk in almost solitude but only a very short walk to the National Museum and the…",5
Much room for improvement,bluebotty,"I expected more from this hotel. After a long day of travel, upon arrival I was asked to wait in reception, where I could ""make my own coffee"". It was 20 minutes later when I was attended to and taken to my Premier Room. I was not told anything about the hotel, where anything was, etc, and in the room I was shown the master lighting panel and that was all. The porter raced back to reception. The room was fine, not large, but I liked the high ceilings. A nice change. The bathroom was large, but the floors, sinks and walls were all marble and made for a very dangerous, slippery floor after showering. All in all, the room was comfortable enough, but not worth the SNG$370+ I paid for it. The air conditioning was terrible. Did not work well at all, and incredibly noisy. As for the…",3
Well deserved stay,Maggielover1,"Purchase my stay via deals.com as it was very cheap. Was there to celebrate my girlfriend birthday. Only short fall was upon arrival I was asked to present my voucher whereby I have given it upon making reservation. I am sure they have my records. Delayed caused as I need to search for my voucher in my blackberry.   Upon entering, I was surprised with the sliced birthday cake as I roughly mentioned the purpose of staying here. Well attentive front office staff.   I enjoyed the evening drinks from 6pm to 8pm but was confused as it mentioned on my voucher evening cocktails. Mainly serving wines.   Breakfast was extremely crowded. Selections not great but acceptable.   Overall, I will rate it as well deserved if you are looking for a short retreat.",5
New meaning to worst!,TimmyT293913,"Air conditioning didn't work properly, people could look in, had mosquitoes coming in. Room was tiny and cramped (far too small for 2 adults), tiny bathroom, couldn't sleep because of noise from neighboring room, rude staff (gave me attitude when I told them about the noise &  how disappointed I was when they’re not doing anything about it. They claimed I got a 'very good' price and could not expect to get a better room. What crap! Breakfast was shabby. Never again. They should turn it into a museum, not charge a fortune and torture the travellers. This place is not worth a penny to stay in, only if they change the entire staff and management team, I may consider. Then again, Nevermind, It’s ok and No Way!",1
Peaceful and elegant,Charles C,"The quietest place I've stayed in Singapore. It is in a park setting in the CBD. Close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT, but walking there requires negotiating a significant hill.  Staff and service excellent.  Pool facilities delightful - two of them - also an excellent free espresso station throughout the day, good free internet service, and free wine and snack service in the evening. I've usually stayed at the Stamford, which is more convenient for the MRT traveler (as I am).  But I would stay here again. Clients paid for the rooms so I can't give recommmendations on price, and I am a minimal user of hotel services. Free internet, coffee, pools and evening drinks put this above the Stamford, which on the other hand has greater MRT convenience and spectacular city views from high floors.",4
this must be a joke,JASolomon,"I tried hard yet failed to notice any significant aspect of this hotel that supposed to make it a great hotel. Location wise, its ok if you don't mind walk up and down hill. The level of service is perhaps the most jarring disappointment. Nevermind that the staffs can't even address guests by their name, they are simply nothing much to shout about other than being ignorant & arrogant. If I have to pay that sort of money again, I would have done it just like how we spent our weekend last week. Pay additional $10 to stay in a REAL 5 star hotel!",1
Feeling like home,Rungsan_Hme,"The HFC made us feel like staying home with a luxury comfort of 5 stars hotel. The receptionists were very helpfull and attentive with our request. I had problem with the drainage and the plumer was show up within 5 minutes to take care. The hotel located off the main road, but the porter can get us the taxi within a few minutes, better than some hotel next to shooping center where was very crowded with customer. So, we did not have any problem as we were thought before our arrival. The room was very comfort and the maid has organized to push both twin beds and change the sheet to make the double bed for us, as all king size bedrooms were full. The hotel served wine and drink with canepe every evening in the lobby; just like we would serve our guest before dinner. It is very…",5
Very nice hotel and fantastic location,khooweiwei,"We had our wedding in Hotel Fort Canning  last month and we had a free room from the hotel. The room was very fantastic. The bed was big and comfy, and the wardrobe was big enough to hang my gown. Beside the bed, there was a small ""living room"" by the window which was equipped with a very comfy chair. The bathroom was fantastic, it's huge and well lit.   The best part of the hotel is the location. It's walking distance to Dhoby Ghaut Station, Plaza Singapura and Cathay. And yet, with all the convenience, the hotel is quiet and surrounded with greenery.  However, the service was not consistent. Some of the staffs were unhelpful and didn't manage to get what we're asking for, but certain shifts staffs were friendly and helpful. The service of  waiters and waitresses in the…",4
A quiet place away from the City!,rclee1988,"I arrived in the hotel on 15th Dec at 2.30pm, check-in was prompt. It took them less than 5mins to check us in. The front-desk staff was friendly and always smiling. During my stay there, the staff always greeted you a ""good evening"" or ""good morning"". I love their hospitality! They even called helped me called for a cab 15mins before I came down as I informed them earlier on that I have another place to go and it was raining cats and dogs outside. Other than that, the Premium room that I booked was better than I expected! Spacious enough for 2 person with a very beautiful study room facing the park. I loved the Nespresso machine and TWG tea! Breakfast, nothing awesome or anything bad about it. I chose the hotel as it was quiet, away from the noise of the city.",5
Upsetting,RobDWLondon,"Based on my previous nice experience with this hotel, I booked them for a sudden one-nighter. They needed more than two hours to bring an electrical adaptor, gave me a room with malfunctioning bathroom equipment, a badly stained bed sheet and provided a breakfast with unspeakable scrambled eggs. I documented those faults but only got an email saying ""we have forwarded your concerns to the respective departments""  Seems they have started to believe their own propaganda.",2
Unbelievable,JSMND,"I booked this hotel as a cheaper – not so cheap - hotel near but walking distance from Orchard road, fooled by the room photos on the hotel's website. The pictures, if not fake, are from some other room than the one I stayed. The corridor smells bad and the room was just full of that foul smell. The standard room is not of standard size, probably smaller and does not deserve this price, not even close. Internet is slow. I believe that this hotel would be well priced at around 100 SGD, and no more, even given Singapore's current high hotel prices.  On another note, upon arrival, despite having given your credit card details, you are asked to pay a deposit for incidentals. Unbelievable, rude, insulting, unique in my experience in the times of the credit card.  Please note that…",1
A Silent Escape for business travellers.,IzraManantan,The staffs who entertained us were Filipinos which gave us a very hospitable impact. Rooms are cleaned every time we come back from the convention we attended. Bottled water and shower amenities are replenished everyday. Good service. A very quiet place. No busy scene as we can only see trees in the park. Bad location I should say as it is not accessible to the main streets. We never had any problems during our stay. There are also no staffs in sight in the hallway. Satisfactory. Tons of reading materials provided in the room.,5
Value for your $$$,PowerRanger88,Me and my partner decided to stay in this hotel because of a very good purchased deal on the Internet.We checked in on a very busy day and waited but what can I expect?As it it is advertised for both Groupon and Deals.com deal where we also got our booking.We arrived at the hotel at 2pm and only managed to check into our room at around 2:45.While waiting we enjoyed delicious cakes and the Nespresso coffee at the lobby.Maybe another check in counter should suffice as 2 counters were both overwhelmed with guests and not to mention staffs still have to entertain calls.We were checked in by a polite and efficient front desk lady who also sent us to our room and explained how everything works as the system is not so easy to use.We were surprised to know that the lights and…,5
Quiet refuge in a bustling city,WLTang,"Although the location was rather inconvenient (required quite a bit of walking from the nearest MRT station with lots of steps to conquer), the effort is well rewarded with the quiet calm of Fort Canning serving as the hotel's main draw.  Had no issues checking in even though it was a weekend, queues were non-existent. The check-in staff were extremely polite and professional, took only about 5 minutes for us to be cleared and brought to the room.  Room-wise, the layout and decor was good. The bathroom was stunning. Although it might be a little too big, it is a refreshing change from the tiny, cooped up bathrooms of most hotels. Enjoyed the complimentary nespresso and tea, only grouse was that there weren't enough milk creamers to go with them.  Overall, really enjoyed the stay…",5
Ridiculous,JustinaSeymore,"My room was only entitled to 1 breakfast when I booked my room for 2 people.  My room faced a large grey wall which overlooked the park and people passing by could look inside. Where is the privacy? This is ridiculous!. The hotel staffs are also unfriendly and rude. They are also unable to give us a satisfactory answer to our enquiries which is extremely frustrating. One of the staff even asked us to show our pass to verify that we are guests of the hotel, what kind of unreasonable service and attitude this is?",1
Vacation turned into nightmare.,Timothy C,Returning home from a three weeks break around asia. I have seen many hotels destinations in my lifetime and i would say this hotel is the least friendliest and worst hotel by far. The only thing i liked about this hotel was they have done a great job preserving the entire hotel building. It is truly a masterpiece. Everything else in my view is managed by a team of unprofessional people. My troubles started weeks ahead before i set off on my journey. I waited very long at night because of the time differences to speak to the right department about my bookings. Someone picked up my call and transfers the call before i could finish my sentence. The line i was transferred to kept on ringing until it got cut. I tried again and once again the lady transferred my call again without…,1
"5 star property,0 star service",Candygirlcan,"Charming hotel but very bad service. Check in takes forever as you can see very clearly that the reception is overwhelmed,understaffed and untrained. It will help if reception staffs were more friendly. Rooms are wearing out and the signs are obvious. Housekeeping staffs don't understand what you really want and just say ""ok"" to everything. When we returned to our room everything was opposite of what we requested for. No one bothers to answer your calls for extra amenities. If housekeeping bothers to replenish the mini bars, sugar,creamer,coffee,tea and water i don't even have to call for help in the middle of the night in the first place. Very annoying. Cocktail hour is a joke. Air-con was very cold on our first night and we reported about it. Nothing was done. We suffered the…",1
small room,PeiqinLiew,singapore hotels are as small as it can get.  the size of the room is the only negative point i can think about.  the most important thing about this hotel is the complimentary welcome drink every evening! there is a wide selection of drinks available (red / white / sparkling) coupled with cheese and biscuits to welcome guests.  the location is pretty out of the way (on a hilltop) but the serenity of the location frees the guest from the hectic urban jungle of singapore,4
A green oasis in the concrete desert,ADTariq,"We stayed at this hotel for quite a while (business trip). It is an amazing hotel, the fittings are all modern, the rooms are comfortable and well designed. the only drawback in the actual rooms is the damn AC system witch needs an electrical engineer to figure out (neither of us did, we just sort of winged it).   At the morning have a fresh galss of their cucumber water was refreshing before venturing off into the humidity. THe restaraunts and snack bar had amazing quality food (except breakfast, but in my experience Asian countries are always bad with breakfast).

Worst hotel ever,Nancy Y,"Checked in at 2pm & room was not ready.I was asked to come back later ""bluntly"" for the room. It was raining and hotel had no umbrellas. What kind of hotel will not have umbrellas? Having 2 kids with us we somehow managed to get a taxi and reach the nearest shopping centre. After wasting our time just walking in circles we took the taxi back to the hotel. The taxi driver took us to the wrong hotel. Very frustrated by now that at 6:15pm room was not ready yet. Spoke to the staff and they didn't know anything and we had to repeat our ""story"". Spoke to the manager and it was not helpful either. Got into the room at 6:45pm and towels were stained and had hairs on them.Asked for extra towels and it never came.Not very impressed. Room was small & dirty. No choice as my kids were…",1
AMAZING!!!!!,Daniellefox,"The Staff here go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable experience, could not fault anything.  Would definitely recommend.  Location was perfect and a two minute walk to both orchard road and the MRT.  Buffett breakfast every morning is a must and the wide selection of food is commendable. Great views from all rooms, amazing beds and the pillows come In a wide variety for everyone's liking. Pools created the perfect way to cool down ",5

We were left waiting at the reception with a lot of other people waiting for their rooms too. The staff suggested we visit Plaza Singapura mall which is a distance away and the route there was unsheltered when it looked it was going to rain. To pacify the crowd the staff set up a pantry area with drinks and cookies, but there was no cups or teaspoons provides for the drinks! They only replenished the cups after half an hour after which they did not provide teaspoons. The glasses for juices that they provided were also stained by earlier drinks. After waiting for another half hour, I had to approach the counter to enquire how long more we had to wait, and the lady…",1
Bad Service,merkie12486,"My boyfriend and I planned a staycation at Hotel Fort Canning as we always wanted to check-out this hotel as we always pass by, but never went inside. However, I made a mistake of choosing this hotel for our staycation..  Upon arrival, I tried to check-in, but there were only 2 check-in counters, which were already occupied by other guests. I tried to get other staff's attention, but they never attended to me. After 10 minutes, I gave up and just ran to the check-in counter after the guest had left..only 2 check-in counters on a Saturday afternoon..does that make sense?

Garden in the City,stefanciecierski,"A beautiful setting and beautiful hotel It is spacious and well designed with interesting room layouts and set in a lush garden close to Clarke Quay and a metro station The restaurants are very expensive and not very interesting but it's easy to go to the rest of the city The gym is good and the pools are large and well managed Walking through the park in the evening is a good way to see it and the noise of the frogs is amazingly loud ! Service was good At the weekends local weddings tend to take over the place, but overall well worth a stay",4
Perfect location - character hotel,Vicki T,"I really enjoyed my stay in this restored boutique hotel in a park oasis in busy central Singapore.  I visit Singapore regularly for business and usually stay in one of the major 5 star hotels. This time, I chose Hotel Fort Canning for a change and was delighted.  The setting is beautiful - how wonderful to have an outlook of trees - and it was only a 5-10 min taxi ride to my work at SunTec city.  Taxis were always available - and (contrary to some other reviews) drivers knew exactly where the hotel was.  I absolutely loved: the bathroom (fantastic bath!!), room decor (fabulous bed/bedlinen/pillows), the in-room Nespresso machine (yes!!), the complimentary evening canapes and drinks, the pools, the very friendly, helpful, efficient reception staff, and great breakfasts (really…",5

Colonial chic meets modern twist in park hideaway,shanuspube,"We stayed here for 3 nights during our honeymoon. The location was great - in a beautiful park (and away from the noise and hustle & bustle of the city) yet only a 5 minute walk from the city centre. It is also near various public transport stops. It is also a 1minute walk from the British underground base during WW2, which is now a museum.  The building is a beautiful, British colonial style, and is complimented by a modern feel inside with gadgets too. The room was spacious, comfortable and the bathrooms were fantastic. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The 2 swimming pools were fantastic and almost always empty too.  We had room service one and used the restaurant once too - both were great. The breakfast was very nice. And the complimentary manager's drinks…",5
Wonderful rooms but terrible noise occasionally,fitzfloyd,"There are two aspects to staying at this hotel which are in complete contrast to one another. Firstly, there is accommodation in the gracious and beautifully restored colonial building, which I’d definitely rate as a 5 star experience. Secondly, there is the conference holding side of the hotel’s business which leads to hotel guests’ terrible experiences – related to the noise and mayhem associated with hundreds of conference delegates or wedding guests. Public concerts in the park are also a potential noise factor.  On the positive side, this boutique hotel consists of a truly elegant old building in gracious Canning Park, with sympathetically restored rooms in which it's a privilege to stay. This may be the only hotel in Singapore to boast a heritage building in a vast, green…",4
Splendid isolation?,Queen_of_NW2,"I will not return. Grandly up on a hill, but consequently a long wait for taxis in order to escape. Two restaurants: Glasshouse (Asian and Western) in separate building and in-house Italian with ridiculous wine prices (S$18 for a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc?)  Geared to corporate events more than tourists. Franchisees of a well-known fitness club had a splendid party in a marquee mere feet from my room. If you want to hear a hundred drunken fitness instructors dance to Eye of the Tiger, then this is the place to stay.",2
Excellent,OverseasTravel2,"While the hotel is an historic building the interior is very modern. It's well located to the CBD and Orchard Rd. Lovely pools and grounds. The hotel gym is exceptional with plenty of equipment.  The rooms are large for Singapore hotels.  Bed is very comfortable and bathroom is terrific.  Shower could do with a rethink, shower head for rain like feel is 9 feet above and hand held is literally hand held - sensible to have a simple addition of placement of hand held above head height.  There is a common platform for turning on lights, air conditioning and lifting and closing blinds - system is logical but takes a little while to grow accustomed to.  Food for breakfast was perfectly fine.  Service was excellent although check in and out took a little time.  Would happily stay again.",5
Lack of customer focus,Kirstywheats,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights. Previous residents of Singapore, we were excited to try out the new hotel. I made a reservation via Agoda and on arriving at the hotel realised I'd made a mistake and booked the room for one, not two people. I explained this to the front desk who said I would need to pay SGD25++ to cover the additional breakfast. I explained that this was frustrating seeing as the room price was the same on Agoda irrespective of whether there was one or two people staying in the room. I asked if it was possible to have two breakfasts on one day as opposed to one each day as I couldn't breakfast the second day anyway due to an early flight. I was simply told breakfasts were not transferable. It is a shame that in a country like Singapore where there is…",2
Gorgeous,lloydave,"Had 5 days in Singapore and chose to stay at this historical Hotel Fort Canning, a grand building with a contemporary feel is a rare find, located in a beautiful park central Singapore.   Rooms were large, modern and spotlessly clean.  Front desk were efficient and helpful. Housekeeping very slow with any requests, but not enough to annoy.  Two swimming pools available, which in the Singapore heat is a necessity.  A wonderful touch though was free drinks and nibbles from 6 til 8 every evening!    A short walk to public transport & restaurants through the park, very convenient!  I highly recommend a stay at this lovely piece of calm in the park...",5
Good hotel,TashaJay8,"We stayed here for the first 4 nights of our honeymoon. We decided to stay here based on the location and the reviews on tripadvisor. The location is very good, as it's only a short walk to the nearest MRT. The hotel itself is very nice, our room was spacious with a very nice bathroom, although we were expecting to have a room with the bath in the bedroom, so we were a little disappointed when we found we didn't. The breakfast was excellent and had a lot of choice and the free canapes and drinks each evening was a lovely extra. The swimming pools we great and empty every time we went there which was a bonus. The only minor point was that my Husband had asked for some champagne for our arrival (as it was our honeymoon), but this never happened. Overall a great place to stay in…",4
Wonderful Singapore hotel,NMC1970,"This place is quite something, and very different from the norm in Singapore. Firstly, the architecture - the building was the home of the British Military, so is very intersting in its layout and the new owners have done wonders with the space. Secondly, the rooms - quite lovely and the bathrooms that look out over the back are brilliant - you'll see why when you stay there. I went on business, but will be taking my wife there one day. It's that good.",5
Nice Location... pity about reception resourcing and multiple weddings,JSK534,"We stayed for two nights (weekend package – breakfast included and free wine between 18:00hrs and 20:00hrs).  Our break was as R@R from Kuala Lumpur (where we lived for the last 3 years).  We have visited Singapore numerous times over the last 10 years.  This time we were seeking peace and tranquillity, with some “retail therapy”.  The location is very good.  The building is dripping in character and history.  The grounds are well kept.  The following are offered to help HFC Management address the necessary areas for improvement.  I note the hotel has failed to reply to any other feed back left on this site.

Canning and was delighted with every service!  The first impression of the grand hotel is its presence on top of the hill in a very lovely and lush area of the city.  It borders a beautiful park, as well.  The next good impression was the delicious aroma that greeted you when you walk into the front lobby--it was something floral and fresh and amazing.  I asked what it was, but no one seemed to know.  The rooms were ultra modern/high tech, which was very convenient and useful, as well as beauitful and comfortable.

Second and last time,chayato,"I stayed first time in 2011 with FC Hotel Singapore and was overall positively impressed with this hotel. They are located in the middle of a Fort Canning park, the rooms were very beautifully furnished and the hotel was brand new. This was my second time and I have unfortunately only witnessed clear deterioration. Examples include: - Average maintained rooms (fixtures, furniture, walls, bath room...) - my bed sheets on second day were evidently torn and I had to ask reception to change them. Worth mentioning that I was kindly offered a bottle of red wine by hotel management for this incident. Surprisingly though personnel could service the room with highly visible torn sheets... - Breakfast service is very poor (evidently untrained staff wondering around and not really…",2
Super staycation,Alexandra147,"We ended up staying at the hotel Fort Canning for a one night staycation as the hotel we were originally booked into was undergoing some major building works.  Our whole experience was fabulous from start to finish.   The location of the hotel is great, close enough to the city but far enough away to feel secluded and peaceful. As we were doing a staycation we actually weren't too bothered about being close to all of Singapore's main attractions but just wanted somewhere where we could escape and have a relaxing weekend.  Before even stepping inside the hotel you can see that the building is full of history. Inside, the hotel has been beautifully restored and is modern, whilst still  managing to retain its old colonial charm. Althought there is no spa, the two swimming pools are…",5
Beautiful hotel – shame about the service and the maintenance,SWKA,"By the end of our stay our view of this hotel mellowed a bit. At first we were underwhelmed by the service and the room design but it grew on us over the four days we stayed.  The welcome (at 5am, straight off a flight from Europe) was non-existent. The lady at reception did not welcome us and then wanted to argue over details of the booking (apparently the booking was for one person and we were two!) – all we wanted to do was get to our room and have a shower (for which we had paid an extra nights cost to guarantee availability).  Once in the room we discovered that there were no bath robes – we rang housekeeping and got the lady at reception. She firmly insisted that the bath robes were in the room and that she would come round immediately to show us where - needless to say…",3
Great character and atmosphere,Joe A,"This hotel is expensive, but you're getting something quite special. The rooms are artistically designed and don't feel like standard hotel rooms. The location is great - quiet and yet central, set in a park and a five minute walk to Dhoby Ghaut MRT which is a major interchange. Everything feels new. There are 2 large swimming pools set amongst trees and a gym with new clean equipment. Unlike some hotels,  they don't charge for wireless Internet, and the service is fast and reliable. I found the staff friendly and helpful. I'd definitely visit again.",5
An Oasis in a Busy City!,Lind-Fran,"We really enjoyed the experience of staying at Hotel Fort Canning! We liked the friendly relaxed atmosphere, the staff went out of their way to help and always greeted us.  We have stayed at several hotels in Singapore, so were looking for somewhere a little different and this hotel certainly was! The building is beautiful with an interesting history, how wonderful that the facade was retained while turning the inside to a very comfortable hotel. I suppose this is why some rooms have an unusual layout, but this is what makes it a unique place to stay.  It is a little out of the way, but that is one of its charms, especially if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of a busy city (even locals who dropped us back to the hotel after dinner, did not know it was there!). After…",5
Fort Canning Hotel,GItrip,Very nice hotel with good views in the heart of Singapore.  High tech seems to be the theme of this modernised historic building.  No complaints about the quality of the room but it probably needs a user manual to get the most out of it!,5
Tranquility in the heart of a fave bustling city,Martyn P,"Very nice colonial hotel in the heart of Singaport.  Close to all the places you need to be yet removed enough to relax in too.   Not cheap by any means but that's not why you stay there.   Some of the staff need a few more points in their EQ and the 'standard room could be a little better for the money.   Free wifi, great wine list and a wonderful setting make up for that and more.     Not perfect, expensive but it's very hard to be disappointed by this place.",4
Peaceful location,ChookThaiNguyen,Peaceful location but still close to everything thats required. Beautiful gardens and surrounds which is rich in history.

Would definately stay again and recommend to anyone who is looking for a quite piece of luxery.,4
The best place I ever been,Emil M,"In a 3 day business trip I have nothing to comment, all services are at their best! The location is perfect, you can go by foot to Marina Bay in about 10-15 minutes; the hotel is located on a green hill ( a rare site in Singapore) and it is surrounded by a lot of vegetation. The swimming pool is small but good. the services are great; what I iked the most is that everywhere you can find free good quality expressed coffee ;)",5
Very impressed,Michael M,"We stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning from Sunday, August 26 - 31st 2012. The room was beautiful and the property impressively designed. In our room, the bath was entirely marble with big windows looking out over the city with a soaking tub on one side and a rain shower on the other. Huge double doors separated it from the rest of the room. All controls for the lights and drapes and air conditioning were very high tech and you could choose to manage them from either the television or touch pads around the room.  But the service is what really was impressive. We've stayed in 5 star hotels around the world and many wonderful boutique hotels as well but the service at the Hotel Fort Canning was as good and in most cases even more personal than those. By the time we left, we knew our…",5
Nice stays,MrsRance,"I was staying in room 109 from 6 until 7 August. I chose here because I wanted to watch Snow Patrol concert in Fort Canning Park. The hotel is so near to the venue, only take 6 minutes walking.  I like the room but the only weird for me was the bath tub near the bed. The coffee maker and the water heater in my room was broken. called the front desk but they didn't do anything.",4
Lovely Hotel with excellent service,pinkyucca,"I have been staying at Hotel Fort Canning with my husband for the past 2 New Year's eve. The room has a bathtub in the middle of the room, and Thann tolietries are supplied. There is a free flow supply of cheese and red/white wine, along with TWG tea and coffee at the lounge from 6-7.30pm. I will reccomend this hotel for a romantic getaway. In fact we missed the breakfast for both stays (ends at 10.30am) as the bed and pillows are too comfy.",5
Horrified,Emperor C,I'm a nature lover so i decided to give this hotel a try. Taxi drivers don't know where this hotel is. Staffs busy chatting and like previous reviewer mentioned service is very much lacking. They need re-training urgently. Unpleasant and clearly bored with their jobs. My room looked different compared to what i saw on their website. When questioned staff was not interested to explain. Room had bugs in them. Breakfast was lousy. Lucky i did not have to spend another night there. I will never stay here again.,1
"Beautiful hotel, excellent location, stunning gardens",AliseZeunert,"We had our honeymoon at this hotel and absolutely loved it. It was clearly very new and had been beautiful designed. The bathrooms are unusually appointed with sweeping views over the gardens (rather than having a window in the bedroom), but were stunning.  The botanic gardens setting at Fort Canning was an absolute delight and gave the hotel a real oasis feel.  Breakfast wasn't hugely extensive compared to other parts of Asia but was nice and did the job. Tropical colonial haven.",5
Boutique Hotel or Budget Hotel?,patientsgtraveller,No service in this hotel. No one helps you with the luggages. No one shows the direction to your room. No one answers the phone when you call from your room. No one cleans your room. No one clears the trays in the corridors. No one greets you goodbye. So what am I actually paying for and why should I come back?,1
Something missing at Fort Canning,TonyAyk,"First impressions of the hotel are great. Wonderful modernisation, nice room with fancy bathroom, views, good public areas and free drinks are a nice touch. Service is a somewhat lacking - don't expect any at all if you are at the pool. Staff will walk past with a smile but no one is there to take a drink or food order. We liked the location, but don't stay here if you want to be in the heart of the action.",3
Park View could mean Wall view,Jan R,"Have lived in Singapore for many years and the park and building are very nice and decent renovated.   Booked the Park view room, they gave me 2nd floor looking at a grey wall. Changed to a 3rd floor City View Studio. Bigger but not nicer as setting area is very small and narrow, bath in the middle of your bedroom. City & Park view through a very small and narrow window.   Not really expensive (nothing cheap any more in SINGAPORE), but for me not worth it's $!",3
"I really wanted to like it, but.....",harryohk,"I chose to stay at the Hotel Fort Canning because I'd passed it a few times on previous visits and liked the building, it's set in a beautiful location, and because for that particular week, its rates were radically lower than my usual choices in Singapore (Ritz Carlton, Conrad or Mandarin Oriental). The location seems remote, but is actually close to both shopping and business districts, though getting a taxi from the hotel involves paying a booking fee. First impressions are very positive - attractively converted colonial era building, welcoming reception area, adequately friendly and efficient staff.   My first impression of the room was not so positive. My first key didn't work, and when the front desk person came with me to open the room on the second attempt, she couldn't…",3
Left in Disappointment,kj0810,"My partner and I had booked the deluxe room at Hotel Fort Canning a nice, romantic getaway. However we ended up feeling extremely disappointed and short-changed.  The young man who assisted in our check-in process did not even smile or greet us. He took such a long time to process the check-in and throughout, he had a “can’t be bothered” look on his face. He didn’t even take the initiative to explain or share information on the complimentary evening drinks which we were entitled to, on where to have breakfast and how to get to our room. It was only when I inquired, then he answered briefly.  We understand that “Every guest is personally walked to his/her room and given an orientation of the various features in the room”. When we asked about how to get to the room, the Front Desk…",2
Out of the way and likely to stay that way,ozmadmax,"In a city with so many hotels to choose I decided to stay here because the rates were good and I had been recommended by various people to try it out. The hotel is very nice, nice rooms, nice surrounding, historic building etc. The room was well fitted out and modern but it felt very enclosed and ""cell-like"". The shower had a problem with hot water but the batch did not. Unusual layout to the room but that is part of the character of the hotel. Breakfast was included in rate as was wifi internet so good value. Breakfast was a bit of a hit and miss and service was below average for the type of hotel. Location can be a bit of an issue in getting transportation (taxis) and some taxis often mistake the hotel for the YWCA nearby.",3
Lack of attention to detail,Lydia N,"It was our first stay at HFC and while their extra perks of coffee and alcohol in the evening was a nice to have, it could have been a lot better if the hotel had put in more effort into room design and service.  Firstly, it was our honeymoon stay and they put us in a room right next to the lobby. Well done room manager.  Secondly, the room was poorly appointed and not properly cleaned. Either the sink top has a poor choice of materials leaving it looking stained or the room was just dirty. It was hilarious that the power points were hard to find because they had left a lamp over the desk top cover that nicely hid the power points. And the sink had no shaver power point.   The lighting control remote of the room is really complicated and you wind up doing a lot of trial and…",1
there is something missing.....,cmh1979,"the hotel is beautifully located in singapores fort canning park. the interiors are nicely done, even the negative mentioned bathroom layout i liked. rooms are for singapore standards quite small but nevertheless very cozy an well appointed.  room: it happened 2 times (out of 3 nights) that there was no hot water to shower  food: breakfast served at ""the glasshouse"" restaurant is very average as wel as the quality of food. overall impression didn't make me to book a table for lunch or dinner. the variety of choices at the buffet are highly limited. the so called ""assorted cheese buffet"" is actually 2 sorts of babybell and another foil wrapped cheese. same thing with the afternooncocktails (in roomrate included). nice idea to serve complimentary drinks but nothing special in…",3

However, the standard of service is definitely not 5*.  We checked in at 2pm, and find that though we liked the room, we would have preferred the deluxe instead of the garden deluxe room. The garden deluxe room was not private at all (as conveyed by the receptionist when called to enquire about it). Everyone walking past the common area can clearly look into the ""private garden"" as well as into your room, not to mention your toilet.

Heritage icon transformed into modern hotel,lexnex_a,"The hotel is surrounded by lush greenery of Fort Canning park and enjoys a unique location in the cultural heart of Singapore. It is close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, Orchard Road and is a short walk to Clarke Quay and Peranakan Museum. The redeveloped 1926 heritage icon is a true masterpiece. Rooms combine colonial legacy with modern comforts. Staff is friendly and helpful. Both swimming pools have lovely warm water. Excellent breakfast. Really enjoyed our stay.",5
Quiet time in the busy city,DX1971,"Hotel Fort Canning is a secluded boutique hotel inside the Fort Canning park. It boast tastefully designed rooms with high ceiling and all the modern amenities you would expect from a premium hotel. What I love and hate the most about it is the location. I love it because it is so quiet that I can spend the whole morning sleeping in. I hate the location because it is quite hard to get a taxi during peak hours and it is a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station.  If you are in Singapore to shop, shop , shop, this is not the hotel for you. However, if you are there with your special someone and intend to mix shopping, sightseeing or even work with some quiet time with your partner, Hotel Fort Canning should be highly considered. Thanks again to Cielo for helping with my needs…",4
A great stay,DEGGuildford,"Have just spent four nights at the Hotel Fort Canning and can't wait to go back.  Situated in a nice, quiet location next to Fort Canning park, the hotel is peaceful yet only 10 minutes walk from the bustle of Clarke Queue with its bars and restaurants. If you are into Second World War history, the famous Battle Box (site of British army HQ during the fall of Singapore) is right behind the hotel.  The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms luxurious.  A great place to stay.",5
Dissapointing,Michael,"I was really looking forward to staying at Hotel Fort Canning, but ended up being extremely dissapointed. If I had been taken blindfolded to my room without any staff interaction I might have left the property with a positive impression.  On the positive side I really liked the room (even the silly bathroom layout), and the location which isn't as bad as it looks like on the map. In reality Orchard Rd. and Marina Bay is within walking distance.  On the negative side I was left with the impression that the staff were either incompetent or indifferent (or maybe both???). The check in/out took a looong time, by a gentleman who could barely contain his yawns. There was still breakfast trays left in the hallways at 2:30 in the afternoon, and the public areas seemed cluttered, and…",2
Curiouser and Curioser,robbwill_10,"This is our second stay at the HFC.  In many ways this is a wonderful hotel; excellent staff, wonderful quiet location, beautiful pools and an understated air of elegance.   We chose a grand luxe room (city view) this time because they looked larger than the park view grand luxe. The room however was a triumph of style over substance. Why?  1. A bathtub in  the middle of the room was novel but presented a potentially lethal opportunity to trip on the bath plinth 2. both toilet and shower cubicles opened directly into the bedroom; acceptable if travelling alone but it meant you shared your experiences with your room mate 3. Toilet and shower were slightly sunken (to avoid possible flooding?) making for another opprtunity to trip on the step and clobber yourself on the marble and…",5
Weekend Retreat,tscherhyl,"Booked a room at HFC for a weekend night as a birthday/music festival retreat. The hotel is located near Fort Canning Park but is quite a walk to town, the location is great for a quiet retreat!   The room is spacious and extremely clean. The bed was very comfortable! The bathtub is awesome but there is no barrier separating it from the room. This will make having a bubble bath difficult and somewhat awkward if you are with friends. The shower and toilet is separated thankfully! The room also comes with an espresso machine, great for a caffeine junkie. AC/television/lightings are done via a high-tech touch control, though it took a while to have it figured out.  Room service was efficient. We tried the Nasi Goreng Kampung and it was one of the best I ever had!  HFC is pricer…",5
Old Singapore.,Marc L,"I am currently staying at the Hotel Fort Canning. Located in the centre of the city sort of halfway between Orchard Road and Marina Bay Sands. Firstly taxi drivers seem to struggle to find this place. Why? Im not sure. Mine even had a GPS in the car and still rang a friend. The location is superb, considering you are in the middle of a vibrant city it remains extremely quite. The rooms are beautiful, modern and comfortable. Breakfast is served in the glasshouse and was very good. Excellent coffee and eggs but that all comes down to personal taste. Staff are friendly and always ready to help. Each room seems to have a outdoor area that is perfect for sitting with a glass of wine.  Compared to the Fullarton Hotel which is almost double the price, Hotel Fort Canning wins hands…",5
Perfect Singapore Escape,bella1000,"We spent a beautiful two days/one night at the gracious HFC.  After the night flight from Australia, we arrived very early in the morning. We didnt expect our room to be available so we were straight into a morning walk through FCP as we watched Singapore come to life.  The hotel is located within the park and is a rare treat to find such serenity in Singapore.  The staff went out of their way to accomodate our familiy, organising check in as soon as possible and ensuring the room was suitable for us.  The hotel has an old world charm, reminiscent of a long gone era, coupled with a recent renovation and facility upgrade.  It is delightful, unexpected and relaxing.  The breakfast was perfectly adequate, prosecco on the terrace at night - gorgeous, taxis, a quick call away and…",5
A delight but in need of a little more attention to detail,laansa,"Loved the hotel. Don't understand why it isn't promoted more. Fabulous location, charming rooms, 2 swimming pools.Very popular Italian restaurant. Downside: lack of attention to small details (eg gym was not open early in am, pool loungers needed a good clean).

HFCs got character,John-HKSAR,"Just had 2 nights there for a conference held in the Ballroom and I will definitely go back.  This place is beautiful.  They have done a spectacular job archtecturally, the rooms and function spaces are different and special.  New hotels have pokey little rooms no matter what you pay for them but these are high ceilinged, generously proportioned and quite unique in their arrangement of space.  I loved the bathrooms!  If you like architecture try this place. I read some of the negative reviews (because of course we all do!) and I wouldn't say they were totally wrong, there is always room to improve, but none of them impacted my overall good experience of HFC.  Yes, the door handle in room 2009 drooped too but the thing is it didn't matter (the doors open by pushing anyway), and…",4

When at Clark Quay really enjoyed walking around Fort Canning. Didn't realise there was a hotel there until looking for accom this time.

"Smart, Modern & Comfortable - But Maybe a Bit Characterless",HampshireKenny,"Don't get me wrong, this is a very good hotel.  The rooms are super comfortable and have everything you might need.  Its a high-tech ambience, with touch controls for the mood-lighting, curtains, TV, Internet, air-con, etc.  I would definitely ask for one of the rooms overlooking the back of the hotel - there can be festivals and events held in the Park opposite which can make it a bit noisy through to midnight.  But, being Singapore, its all well controlled and managed so it doesn't cause untoward disturbance.   Breakfast is taken in the restaurant and is buffet style - it can feel busy and crowded - so not always somewhere for a relaxing start to the day.  We also eat an evening meal there one night.

This is my fav in Singapore,rasna s,"I have stayed in over 10 luxury hotels in Singapore - but this one is my favorite. I stayed here for 2 weeks. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are beautiful - the bathtub is huge and the view is incredible. The hotel is within the fort canning park and if you are lucky, you can get a room facing the park (as opposed to facing the YWCA). The working table is comfortably large to accomodate everything and the lounge chair in the room is not just a piece of furniture to adorn the room. The staff is also very friendly. The Italian restuarant serves some deliccccshhh dishes and the best part is that they can cook and season it as per your request.

Great weekend getaway for 2,Eddie T,"My husband and I stayed in Hotel Fort Canning in a Premium King room in June, it was a wonderful experience overall. With the working station and the restroom overlooking the park, it is just something you can't find it in Singapore! The only - point is the air conditioning, it is a bit too noisy, spoken to staffs at front desk and realised that it was due to technical problems.   The breakfast provided at the Glasshouse was average compared to other hotels in Singapore, however, the ambience was good and the place is indeed perfect for relaxation.   Staffs in HFC are friendly, responsive to our requests and they are always willing to help when you need them.",5
Heritage luxury,gweegin,"The hotel is restored from a heritage building, but interiors are so modern and comfortable you wouldn't miss the high-tech comforts of home. Service was top-notch as of hotels of its class, and the staff warmly extended their help in planning for a birthday surprise.  The free drinks and snacks offered at happy hour are a nice touch, but food disappeared within seconds of being served. Breakfast did not offer a very wide range, but was adequate. The only thing is that the breakfast area was too small, such that guests had to wait an average of 15-25 minutes to be seated. I believe they were offering weekend buffet brunch for outsiders as well, which caused over-crowding. I am not sure of this though, but certainly there were not enough seats for a hotel of this size.  Swimming…",5

The rooms are of an average hotel room size and bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was quite unusual only having a large mirror over the bath a metre away from the basin and so made makeup or brushing teeth a little difficult.  My main concern was the hotel is also used as a function space.  The night we were there it had a Asian food channel event on so most of the outside seating area was closed off from the hotel guests.

In the meantime, they suggested we have breakfast and we also made use of the comfortable waiting area near reception with complimentary tea/coffee/juice.

I was there on business and pleasure so tested the place from different perspectives.  Very boutique style to the place with staff polite and available.... When I arrived.  The high tech rooms show that they no a traveller likes to be spoilt with refinements and that is more important than a bedroom to go ballroom dancing in. However, although my bedroom was small, the bathroom was great. Anyway, the high technology interface meant lights and curtains and temperature was all easily controlled and you could forgo the usual hunting around for the right button.

Although the weather was not ideal (it rained half the time we were there), there is not much to do when it rains apart from relaxing in the room (I believe the spa is now closed). Would suggest all travellers to be prepared to explain to taxi drivers how to get there: tell them it was previously the Legends Fort Canning Country Club which drivers are more familiar with. Otherwise, the service was more than satisfactory: special kudos to the front office who came to fetch us with an umbrella at the Battle Box (war shelter attraction across from the hotel)! Swimming among the lush gardens surrounding the pool was just heaven. The free cocktail evening for guests was just ok but nothing to rave…",4

A haven in the City,Anne W,"Cool and calm and in walking distance of the marina, Chinatown and Colonial district.  Lovely to be in the park, but also so close to everything. Nicely equipped, but a bit perplexed by the electronics! They serve guests free evening wine and nibbles in the residents lounge. Breakfast is served in the Glasshouse and is excellent.   The bar in the main part of the hotel is not owned by the hotel and can't charge to room, which was a bit strange.  Only other grumble is that the air con was very noisy - hence ave sleep quality!

An Interesting but Not Practical Concept,Konchawan_Kevin,"This hotel is located in Fort Canning Hill, which is an excellent place for walks, and historical-remnants searching.  The hotel looks grand, and the interior is relatively pleasing.  However, it is only when you are in one of the guest rooms then you will either be awed or puzzled.  There is a bathtub in the middle of the room, totally open for viewing (that is if you are sharing the room with another not-so-close person, and you really wish to take a bath).  The toilet and the shower room are located next to each other, sharing one door; in other words, if one is using the toilet, and the other is showering, the door hides only either.  They serve food in bamboo baskets which is quite innovative, I would think.  However, when the plate fits exactly into the basket, and when…",3
Yes... no... maybe... probably not.,LookMumNoKids,"I totally agree with the previous reviewer. In many ways, whether or not to stay at this hotel should be a simple matter of taste. Do you want to step out of your hotel tower straight into the activity and retail mayhem of Orchard Road, or do you want the peace of a low-rise colonial building set atop a hill surrounded by glorious rainforest? If your preference is the latter, this hotel SHOULD fit the bill. But for every plus at this place, there's a minus to cancel it out. Probably easiest to list:  LOCATION: May be the greatest strength of this hotel and its biggest weakness. Early morning walks under the forest canopy of Fort Canning are a stunning way to start the day, especially when followed by a swim in one of the hotel's  two impressive pools and breakfast.

"Promising, but recommend avoiding until management fixes several basics.",Christian J,"This is one of the more difficult reviews for me to write, because there was so much that we liked about the Hotel Fort Canning -- and so much that really, really annoyed us. Until management addresses the shortcomings I can’t recommend staying there. But once it does, the hotel promises to be a great addition to Singapore’s lodging options.  I'll start with the less-good qualities -- I'd prefer to end on a more upbeat note, and the problems are fixable.   The central issue with this hotel is that it is located in a heritage building, a factor that inevitably requires design compromises. One of them is noticeable as soon as you walk in the front door: there's no hint of a lobby. Instead, two large staircases confront the guest, masking a bar. It turns out the lobby is located to…",3
Loved It!,Katie O,I thought this hotel was just fantastic! It had a really interesting layout and felt exceptionally luxurious. The only criticism I had was our room had a very disappointing suite area with a not so comfortable couch and it just wasn't a practical use of space.

Rare park setting in Singapore,Sara M,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Fort Canning for about 12 days while we explored Singapore.  We found that we loved this boutique hotel for its great hilltop  location, as well as the surrounding park and pathways.  The MRT, Clarke Quay, the Riverwalk, the Singapore Museum are all very accessable from this hotel.  The rooms seem to have many different configurations and are very modern and very comfortable.  There are 2 pools, with one being a true lap pool.  They are almost deserted as many of the guests are out and about or perhaps there on business. There are juices and cookies  and coffees available in the lobby throughout the day and wine and appetizers in the early evening!  The breakfasts are very good and we really enjoyed the cappuccinos. There is free WIFI.  There…",5
Beautiful hotel in beautiful surroundings.,CarolineAndGreg,Elegant hotel set in a beautiful park situated between Orchard Rd and Clarke Quay. We will return!,5
Convenient to everything I want to do in Singapore yet away from the hustle and bustle.,Freddiemf,"This place charms before you even see it.  As your taxi turns up into Fort Canning Park, you know you are in for a treat.  Overlooking the city, it is removed from it, yet walking instance downhill to many major attractions.  The rooms are futuristic and it's 2 restaurants and  two pools are unique as well.  Yet the price is well below some ofthe over rated stars of Singapore.",5
Especially loved breakfast,NewYork5family,"Hotel was in good location, clean, well managed and the included breakfast was terriffic.  Enjoyed morning runs in the gardens surrounding hotel and felt very safe. It was a little confusing for the cab driver to find, but I would definitely stay here again.",4
Peace and quiet in the middle of a city,timberhead,Hotel Fort Canning was everything all the trip advisor reviews said it was.  Loved being in the middle of Fort Canning Park but close to MRT and all other attractions.  Very friendly staff and food at both restaurants was good.  Lovely old colonial building but very trendy inside.  Loved our stay at Hotel Fort Canning.,5
excellent hotel & relative value in a unique location,MaikoG,"Hotel Fort Canning is a top-notch 5* boutique hotel - although that isn't saying a whole lot in Singapore, which has more than a fair share of high-end hotels from which to choose...  What really sets HFC apart from most other 4-5* accommodation in this city is it's location and relative value.    Set behind the Singapore National Museum in Fort Canning Park, the hotel is at the East end of Orchard Rd.  This makes for a quiet, leafy, and relatively secluded location in which to enjoy your stay, in contrast to the busy street life that accompanies most Orchard hotels.  This location is also the hotel's main drawback, since any quick journey (even to a 7-Eleven) usually involves a car or taxi, and doesn't offer immediate access to the city's amenities.  It's not impossible to walk…",5
Quiet yet central location for heritage hotel,IJB_Cavendish,"The hotel is a converted colonial building. As with many hotels in Singapore, it is very centrally located with respect to the main sights and activities in Singapore. What makes this unique is its quiet location- very rare in Singapore, with Fort Canning Park right behind it. Most tourists rave about other 4 or 5* hotels' locations, but in reality this is not a big differentiation in such a small place as Singapore. Peace and quiet through being at Fort Canning Park, double glazing and not being overlooked is very unusual in Singapore. (I'm not a tourst, I live here- we took a staycation.)  It has all the facilities you would expect from a 5* hotel- one of the best gyms I have ever used in a hotel (and quiet!) and better than average pools (except compared to MBS).  Nice…",4
Great boutique hotel in a quiet but central location,BFGMelbourne,"This hotel is located within Fort Canning Park, which is like a small botanical gardens.  The park is great to walk through, and also has some tourist sites (the Battle Box etc).  We enjoyed the location, as it was about 5 minutes walk to the marina/quay areas in one direction, and 5 minutes walk to Orchard road (shopping) in the other.    To the hotel itself,  Pros:  1.  Beautiful old building, only 3-4 levels, so you didn't feel like you were in a massive, crowded hotel. 2.  Nice pool areas, with 2 separate pools. 3.  Rooms are very nicely designed, a bit different - modern/stylish.  The glass doors leading to the bathroom, and the full wall window from the bathroom looking over the singapore skyline was stunning. 4.  Great service, including opportunity to have a freshen…",5
nice but with a few minus points,FrauTPunkt,"We stayed in the Hotel Fort Canning 5 Nights in December 2011. The Rooms and the Hotel were very nice and especially the huge garden sorrounding it was lovley. Unfortunetly the Service was not so good. My room did not get cleaned and I had to tell the roomservice 2 days in a row that my room has not been made (althought it was empty the whole day). Furthermore i really wanted to take a bath but the shower head was broken and the water ran out. When my parents checked out it was nearly impossible explaining the staff, that they wanted to pay for my room as well althought I was staying longer.  The breakfest was nice but nothing special. The rooms were wondefully designed and very quiet (a pleasure while staying in Singapore). Also notable is the location of the Hotel. It is not…",3
Just checked out,993rs,"As experienced travelers having read the reviews we booked 3 nights and checked out after one. We arrived late evening and ordered room service, the food was good but in the room there was no easy way of eating it as there are no tables or desk at which2 people can eat. We then tried to turn the lights out and they would not turn off, and had an hour waiting to sleep whilst the technicians tramped thru our room to resets the lighting system and went to sleep at 12.30 The design was difficult to navigate in the dark as the bath sits right next to the bed! Having been woken up by the laundry staff early the next day(not requested) we went to breakfast. The juice had run out and fruit was finished with no replenishment forthcoming...

Will not be a returning guest,Omphaloskepsis,"I stayed here on two occasions on 29-31 December on our way to Vietnam and then on 10th January on my way back.  Honestly this hotel has lots of potential to be Singapore's first class hotel but it is let down by it's so called 'hotel policy' which you will see the detail below.  First of all when we checked in on 29 December, I was quite impressed by the hotel decor itself. I myself is a local (Malaysian working in Singapore and living here) and I have stayed in most of the 5* hotels in Singapore. The hotel is nestled in a hill top and I would say it is reasonably well located, with a mere walk of 15 minutes down the hill (and up the hill) to the nearest MRT, although for the physically challenged, I would advise you to stay somewhere else unless you don't mind taking taxi all…",2
Fort Canning - lovely hotel,Allison l,"My fiance and I stayed at HFC over the New Years - it's a nice, modern and clean hotel with great service and conveniently located.

Why have I been staying at the Hyatt and Four Seasons for years?,AussieBizTraveller,"After 50 trips to Singapore staying mostly at the Four Seasons (which is lovely), and the Hyatt (which is good), I just checked into what has to be the best hotel in Singapore yesterday for the first time. Hotel Fort Canning is gorgeous. I only have the most basic room, and it is huge, quiet, has a separate lovely bathroom with deep bath and a gorgeous outlook. I find out when I check in that breakfast is included (amazing breakfast with all food so hot and fresh), free drinks Inc French champagne from 6 pm til 8pm, and free WIFI. The pools are amazing and the restaurants are spectacular. I will never stay anywhere else now, Hyatt can keep their points, this place is worth staying at just for the experience!",5
Lower your expectation,carbonxiv,"Before my stay at this hotel, I was very excited since I was expecting a plesant stay at a nice colonial style place that's located in the city center. First day, I needed to iron a shirt so I had to call the front desk/operator/house keeping/concierge, but no one ever picked up the phone until I dialed 7-8 times to different departments. Then first evening, no hot water! I was too tired to ask. Second day, still no hot water, so I finally got a hold of someone at the front desk via the phone. He said he will send someone. Waited waited waited, no one... Took a cold shower. Went down to talk to the front desk. He promised to get someone to fix it. So yay! Hot water on 2nd night. Third day, morning... it seems no hot water again but I could wait til night. At 11pm at night, got…",3
Wonderful place to stay mixing colonial style and modern styles,chrichen,"Its the 4 th time I am visiting Singapore and used to stay in Mandarin Oriental and my favorite Shangri-La. Both hotels were completely booked for Christmas and I decied to book Hotel fort canning, a nice boutique hotel located at the top of the park Fort canning. I was not disappointed. Nice location, very quite place, Very comfortable room with all modern appliances, huge bathroom. Amazing swimmingpool. Staff just ok. Considering its a boutique hotel  I was very satisfied to stay there 4 days and 3 nights.",4
Peaceful haven in a tranquil park,KjartanToronto,"In the past I had stayed at the Pan Pacific which was huge but a little soulless. The architectural conversion was sensitively done, and the rooms are comfortable and well appointed (though why no shaving mirror or spare toilet paper?). The buffet breakfast has significant choice. We loved the location and discovered you can be at Dhoby Ghaut underground in 10 minutes or take the walking trail to Clarke Quay - the paths are well lit at night.  The complimentary espresso was a nice touch - and given drink prices in Singapore, the champagne in the early evening was delightful.",5
A beautiful haven in Singapore,AprilFool01,"Hotel Fort Canning was a wonderful place to say in Singapore. The room was lovely and had a view of the city. The hotel grounds are immaculate and the parkland surrounds are lush and tranquil, yet only a 15 minute walk to Orchard Road, Clarke Quay and Chinatown, as well as close to the MTR. The hotel breakfast (in the Glass House restaurant) seemed a little unorganised and at times, it seemed that the Hotel may have been slightly understaffed, but still, the service was friendly - the staff at reception were particularly helpful.",4
Tranquility,Paean,"We checked in for a night's stay to chill out and get away for the hustle and bustle of city living.  This hotel is perched up on a hill overlooking the city, and the view from our room was brilliant. Checking in was a breeze. The reception showed us to our room and gave us an orientation of our room's features and the advanced switches that controlled the lights and the curtains. Interesting gadgets.  The bed was comfortable and the sheets were luxurious, though the pillows were a tad hard. We ordered room service, and the food came pretty quick; in a delightful tiffin box set that was practical and quaint. Food's pretty good too.  Loved the complimentary Nespresso machine in the room! Ristretto's my fave. Had our dinner at Gattopardo, and boy do we love their seafood and wine.…",4
Excellent,leshelend,"We stayed here for 4 nights recently, being in Singapore for a wedding; the party being held at the hotel.  Great location to explore the whole of Singapore once you've mastered the way to the MRT station.  Very attentive and pleasant staff, good food in the Glasshouse and such pleasant rooms.  Whilst in Singapore our son had the misfortune to mislay his watch in a taxi from the hotel.  The Front Office staff were extremely helpful and showed real dedication in achieving a succesful return of the article.  Thanks again to all concerned.  Would definitively recommend this hotel.",5
An oasis from the bustle of Singapore,JARMelbourne,"The hotel is situated in Canning Park.  Previously it was an army building, so has lots of Colonial appeal.  We particularly enjoyed the park as we are always keen to walk in the morning.  The check in was a little slow, only one working the front desk at a busy time.  We enjoyed the canapes and complimentary drinks after work each day.    The room servicing was uneven, for example not replacing hand towels, and one day not cleaning properly.  These items were quickly attended to after we called.  It took only 5 minutes for the staff to fix the Nespresso coffee machine in out room.  The rooms are large, and spacious.  Much nicer than your average hotel.  It was nice to look out over the park.  Interesting mod cons eg light switches in the room.  Breakfast in the glass house was…",5
Fantastic Hotel!,Traveller_T-rent,Stayed at Fort Canning Hotel for six nights and could not fault anything. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed with warm smiles and since we arrived in the morning they did everything they could to check us in early. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful. Our room was magnificent it was a lot bigger than I thought and the technology in the room was great. It wasn't that hard to use once you knew how to use it. The breakfast was more than enough and i'm the type of person who likes his breakfast in morning so I don't understand why other people were saying that it wasn't enough. The hotel is only a short walk to the MRT station and it was always nice walking back to the hotel and then going for a swim in the pool which was hardly ever busy. Overall I love this…,5
"inept front desk, and lots of rough edges",Basiluzzo,"We booked a room for six nights at the Hotel Fort Canning on the strength of a very positive New York Times review and an excellent rating on Trip Advisor. We have been to Singapore before and wanted a hotel that would be something of an oasis, with spa-like facilities, but easily accessible and close to the MRT rapid transit system.  The hotel is lovely, a recent renovation of a historic building in a lush park in the center of the city. Unfortunately, there was no warning that it is halfway up a hill. The advertised 8-minute walk to the Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is accurate, but the excursion involves walking out the back door of the hotel, across a veranda, down 2 floors on an elevator, walking through a parking garage, down a hill, across a busy street, through another parking…",3
Great F&B!,leong34,Had lunch at the glasshouse recently. What a great outlet. Set in lush greenery with equally good food to boost! I had a set menu and the lamb was done so wonderfully! Kudos to the chef!,4
Gorgeous and a real respite,NZLA,This is a beautiful hotel! They have done a magnificent job of maintaining the architectural heritage of the building while also being sleek and modern.  Every part of the hotel oozed sophistication and serenity.  Its location is fantastic- set in the grounds of a park- and you feel much further away from the noise and hustle of the city than you really are.  It was a relatively easy 10-15 min walk to Orchard Rd.  Our room was gorgeous- it felt authentically colonial and high-tech all at the same time.  There were some beautiful design elements that I really appreciated.  Pool area was beautiful as well.  There were nice touches like complimentary sweets and beverages set out for guests throughout the day as well as a cocktail hour with drinks and appetizers.  Staff were…,5
Wonderful stay,MTW300474,"This was one of the best hotels Perfect rooms, hi-tech with a wonderful reception hall with all sorts of amenities Eventually the breakfast was a bit average for this type of hotel, as in construction and not 'living' enough - cold, but still a very good standard",5

The Nespresso was great we used it daily , also joined in the complimentary  wine and nibbles before heading out to dinner one night ,it was fun. This Hotel is in the middle of Fort Canning Park, perfect location, just a 5 minute walk trough the park, we always felt safe even walking home after dinner late at night.

A resort in the heart of Singapore,JCLON,Stayed at Fort Canning for business.  I was upgraded to a suite which may have made my experience of the hotel even better than it would have been but this is a fantastic hidden gem in Singapore.  So hidden that most taxi driver cannot find it.  It opened just about a year ago. The rooms are very modern and functional (although not unusual in Singapore) with views of the park that surrounds the hotel.  The staff was really efficient whenever I asked for something. Had room service twice. It is very well presented.  You may find the portions a little small.  Very quiet room and very comfortable bed.,5
Tranquility in shopping heaven,Greenbunnie,"We stayed here for two nights while at a conference.  Being Australian the history of the hotel was very interesting, yet we would never have considered staying here if is wasn't for the conference.  Located in a central but quiet location -  the gardens are just beautiful to wander through and the spice garden is heaven.  Taxis from any shopping area are no more than $10 S.  Rooms are a bit cozy but tastefully decorated with all the mod cons.  Sitting back in the little sun room's comfy chair watching the joggers go by, looking out over the garden, sipping a lovely g&t from the mini bar (need I say more?).  Breakfast was lovely and I really liked the individually cooked to request eggs/omelettes.  I had the fluffy light pancakes and the lovely made to order coffee.  Restaurant…",4
A peaceful oasis in the midst of Singapore,Sue P,"Set in the middle of Fort Canning Park this lovely hotel is a complete contrast to the general hustle of Singapore. Gorgeous rooms, superbly comfy beds, immaculately clean and although not cheap it is very good value. Free wine & canapes for guests between 6pm & 8pm is a lovely touch. Breakfast buffet is ok but not as good as the rest of the place -  best to get there early. Ate in both the expensive Italian - excellent seafood, and the cheaper restaruant which does local food - both very good.",5
New World Luxury in Old World Charms,Sen G,"We have stayed in this fabulous boutique hotel couple of times, as the rates are reasonable and the staffs are warm & friendly. It is a colonial building in a hillside park surrounded by lush greenery, but right in the city centre. A hidden resort but within walking distance to civilization. It's a fairly new hotel to the taxis, just tell them it is in the same building as the former Fort Canning Club.  In-house guests are treated to espresso coffee & tea at the hotel lobby all day, with pre-dinner wine & snacks. One really feels at home here. There are 3 swimming pools with poolside shaded beds.

Perfect place to be at Fort Canning,Wimster,"Stayed for one night only and it was a great experience. Very private, still good access to the city.

Nice to have a 6-8PM happy hour.",4
A brilliant Hotel,robbo12123,"I recently stayed a week for business at the Fort Canning and i won't stay anywhere else now in Singapore.  It is more like staying in a private members club than a hotel, ( What other htoel offer drinks and canops at 6pm)   but with all the facilties that all top hotels offer.  It is very central but being in the middle of the park and  a very historicalal part of the city  you feel away from the hustle and bustle but can be anywhere in 10 Mins. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious, modern and with free Wi fi. The staff are soeme of the most helpful i have ever come across and nothing was too much trouble.

Luxurious Hotel Fort Canning,manasetravel,"This boutique property really surprised our senses, in a really good way. We took our parents on a relaxing short vacation to Singapore recently. Usually, we go for the 'Resort' type of accommodation, but through a recommendation by a business colleague, we went for 'Boutique'. Upon arrival, the entrance was well hidden from the main gate entrance. This was nice and appealing as it did not overcome with the fluster of the usual busy traffic to that of a resort. The classically dressed doorman welcomed us and guided us to the reception desk.  First impressions... Wow.

The smart tv, chaise lounge and nespresso coffee machine are a really nice touch.  The bathroom is the size of some hotel rooms i have been in and very well appointed with a rainshower and a huge seperate bath tub.  The large window and high ceilings add to the feeling of space.

Awesome!,kleh23,"Had a staycation here over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The service was great all around, from the frontdesk and bell services, to the glasshouse staff. Probably one of the few places in Singapore where not only are you served with a smile, but with genuinity as well.   As a Singaporean, even Fort Canning is not exactly a familiar place to me, thus I can understand if taxi drivers have a hard time finding the hotel. But after staying there, I realised how convenient it actually is! It's literally a 5 minute walk to the MRT (the hill isn't that steep), and a 10 minute walk to Clarke Quay (this I never knew till the frontdesk staff told me about the quick walk in the park that leads you there in no time).

Terrible stay at Hotel Fort Canning Singapore,Jason L,"Terrible experience!   They use very unethical techniques against their staff that made us feel as if we were in a third world country. We booked and paid our stay through an agent who later went into liquidation. Six days prior to our stay we informed the hotel the agent had gone out of business, they confirmed that payment had already been received and we were welcome to stay as there was nothing left to pay, so we decided to go ahead with our trip.    Then, part way through our stay they changed their minds and wanted to charge us.

Pluses: Clean and green location with interesting walking paths, dog-walkers, and nearby attractions such as Battle Box; free strong-signal wi-fi throughout the stand-alone hotel building; can be quiet and relaxing.

I especially like the bathroom - It is actually in the balcony (dont worry, for modesty, there are blinds!) with a huge bath tub.  Complimentary cocktails are provided in the evening.  The hotel is also very well equipped with 2 swimming pools, a gym and a spa.  We had breakfast at the ""Glass House"" (within the hotel compound) - the buffet spread was very good!  For those who cannot resist shopping…",5
Good Stay!,JeremyAndre,"Stayed in the Premium room on the 2nd floor. The décor and the ambience of the hotel were great. Room came with high ceiling and very nicely furbished. Huge leather chair in the parlor, very comfortable bed. Modern touch screen panel which was very impressive. The flat screen TV even allowed you to serve the internet! White marbled bathroom came with a rain shower and bath tub. Toilet amenities used was “THANN”. NICE! The room felt more like a home that you will fit right in very quickly! Agents at the desk were fantastic, especially Jin! Ever so willing to help and always had a smile on. Pansy, assistant director of sales, assisted with my room reservation right from the start and she is simply amazing!   Few areas that might not blow you away though. Complimentary cocktail…",4

Most Relaxing Weekend,dwangnc,"Set amongst the greenery of the Fort Canning park, the Hotel Fort Canning, is away from the bustling noise and crowd of the city and yet is close enough.

The restaurant inside the hotel is of exceptional quality, although a bit expensive.",5
It has such potential... But...,OJOJ,"Windows were black with dirt (inside and out) and some have an unpleasant smell. as others have complained the rooms miss a second chair, but the worst thing about this hotel is the f&b offer, and the fact that there isno alternative. The restaurant is not run by the hotel (as they are at pains to point out) and the service was bot just bad, but awful. Extremely rude. It was a Saturday night and my husband and I ended up having to go to the grocery store for a DIY anniversary dinner because we couldn't get anything in the hotel.  Management were unsympathetic despite the fact that we had to see three rooms before we saw a clean one (and thus could check in to our room until 7pm). No discount offered or apology... Or anyhing... And $400 for the experience.  Very poor value for…",1
Great location and hotel but...,Pewit,"We stayed for one night to break the journey from London to Sydney and the location of the hotel is an oasis of calm compared to the down-town area of Singapore. However, this means that access to the rest of the city is by taxi or a long walk.  We had a Deluxe Room with the separate bathroom which worked well for the most part, but for a double room it would be nice to have two chairs so we could both use the desk. The bed could also do with a table or shelf beside the bed for a night-stand. Also there was a surefit of mirrors - some art in their place would have made the room more boutique-like I'd suggest. The ""balcony"" area of the room is separated by clear glass panels from the rest of the room (with the door in the centre). Stupidly, there is nothing on the glass at…",4

It was such a joy to come back to it at the end of a day's shopping or sight-seeing and be greeted by the contemporary decor and delicious fragrance. The staff couldn't be more helpful and welcoming. The cocktail hour (6-8pm) was a very nice touch and we really enjoyed sipping champagne and eating nibbles before a night out on the town - for free!  The rooms are really well appointed with the famous TWG tea and a Nespresso coffee maker. My partner loved the high tech room controls accessible from the bed, and being able to see the Singapore skyline from the shower were great unique features.

Certainly uncommon,t50,Hotel Fort Canning is certainly uncommon with its bathtubs in bedrooms and underground access to the Glasshouse restaurant when its raining (which it often does in Singapore) but it is nonetheless an interesting and pleasant place to stay. It makes a good change for me as well as I travel to Singapore on business frequently to stay in a hotel that is clearly distinguishable from all the other business orientated places. You can walk upstairs; not always possible if you are on the 32nd floor! Nice swimming pools and the park is a good place for a walk.,4

Best ever.,Fayenne,"I had a very very very excellent stay during the weekend that just passed with my fiancé and I have to say, it was more than I have expected. Room was clean and prepared. Delightfully surprised that all switches were touch sensitive with led backlight, wide range of music for your room-mood.  Although the garden's mattress was very stained and housekeeping have already left, it did not dampen my mood as my stay was only a day and we did not have time to relax out there. (weather was v humid too).  All in all, service was great, breakfast spread was not alot but the nice place and service def made it up, room was wonderful, entire place was clean and chic. Def returning for another weekend break, away from hustle n bustle of the city.",5
I love it so much & definitely for sure would recommend to anyone,PencilBangkok,"It's such a nice, trendy, boutique hotel.  The first walk in you will feel such a fresh aroma (they have THANN sanctuary spa in the hotel as well).  The hotel is so private, warm with staff with a great attitude & so polite.  Everything they treat you is so personal & flexible..but of course with the standard they set high.  You will feel important, welcomed and enjoy the hospitality.  And the room itself is decorated so nice...with see through bathroom with big glass window that can see outside to the park (but some other rooms would have balcony..and so on..different sections different decoration I guess).  So for me, I would recommend more than 100% for anyone to try if you have chance.  And the location is near Orchard as well.",5

The service is top class and blew me away when each morning, as I walk in for my conference, the HFC staff prepares a cup of coffee, to perfection, just the way I like it. My collegue was made special beverages which were not on the menu, as she was pregnant, and the HFC staff remember exactly the kind of coffee each guest likes. This personalized attention is something I have not experianced anywhere else in the world to date. The rustic ambience of the hotel, with the little things which make the difference sets it apart from other hotels, and this was the mutual consensus from my Asian team, comprising of delegates from 6 countries.

The hotel is actually part of a country club, nestled within historic Fort Canning Park, a beautiful backdrop to a fantastic hotel.

We stayed here twice on our recent Asian trip and enjoyed our stay on both occasions. Loved eating in the Glasshouse restaurant. Food was of excellent quality - Gangga, asst restaurant manager and Chef Charles were fantastic. Kelson, guest relations manager, made us feel so welcome and was there to help and advise whenever we asked. Not far to the MRT station and Orchard Road so very convenient.

The GM Supriya and staff are very helpful and willing to go extra mile. There are some shortfall in design of the rooms like towel racks are not there but I was provided with portable rack which is great. Room is large, I personally like the DLX rooms without open concept and you should make this clear during reservation. Breakfast selection is large and cook to order eggs! They even offered to make TehC during my stay. Evening drinks with small cheese plate, fruits are a welcome change. Fresh air, no noise in Singapore is welcome change for this city.

Room looks good but it is equipped with technology for technologies sake and not because it works well; annoying system for controlling lightening, curtains and air-condition. Air-condition system is so loud and noisy it stressed me out so I couldn’t fall asleep. If you request privacy they will still knock on your door in the morning.

We stumbled upon Hotel Fort Canning by chance on the internet and decided to give it a try, despite the negative reviews we saw, as at that point we did not have any other option.  From the moment we arrived at the hotel, it became apparent that we would be getting our money’s worth. As an unexpected bonus, we were upgraded to a Premium Luxe room as the hotel was full.

Very poor hotel design,Lee B,"""Architect has run amok"" review was right! The hotel design is terrible! This has/had the potential to be a great hotel in Fort Canning Park with green surroundings but whomever designed this hotel must have been smoking something.  The hotel has tried to cram too many rooms into too small a space. They could have sacrificed a few rooms to increase the per room size a little bit and made this a great hotel. I shouldn't have to lower the blinds just to avoid watching my wife use the toilet but that is what you have to do. The bathroom takes up the whole window which means you have to choose between daylight and privacy. The blinds aren't that difficult to work out but are a bit of a fiddle.  It is not just the rooms.

The staff were very helpful and enthusiastic - it is a nice change from the bigger hotels where you are merely processed from check-in to check-out.  The minor downsides are that it is a new hotel and some taxis don't know precisely how to get there, and the walk from the MRT may be a bit too steep for some.
